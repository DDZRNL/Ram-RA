Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications and Navigation ,"O1.01Coding, Modulation, and Compression", GSFC," GRC, JPL","Power and spectrum efficient solutions are needed for both near-Earth and deep-space science and exploration applications. Channel coding efficiency from 50% to 87%, combined with good bit-error/burst-error correction property will provide solutions to multiple missions. A high-speed, digital receiver capable of demodulating coded modulations in addition to uncoded modulations is needed for future missions. In compression, implementation of a high-speed decoder for decoding a standard embedded bit-stream offering tunable lossy compression to lossless compression is desired. Proposals are sought in the following specific areas: Compression High-speed decoder capable of decoding coded bit stream conforming to CCSDS 122.0-B-1 Image Data Compression standard (www.ccsds.org(link is external)) is solicited. The decoder has to provide over 640 Mbits/sec decoding for up to 16-bit image data coded in an embedded bit stream. The implementation technology shall point to potential space-use feasibility. Coding 1. Special emphasis is placed on a channel coding design suitable for near-Earth missions, operating at least at over 80% coding rate with an error floor lower than Bit-Error-Rate (BER) of 10e-10, and at least 8-bit burst-error correction property, with encoder/decoder complexity consistent with implementations at data rates close to 1 Gbps and power consumption smaller than a few watts. The new design when compared with current CCSDS Reed-Solomon (255,223) coder at BER of 10e-5 shall have over 2dB Eb/No gain. The preferred code block frame length is from 4K to 16K bits. Proposed implementation technology shall point to potential space-use feasibility. 2. High-speed FPGA decoder for a set of 10 recently proposed low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes specified in a CCSDS Orange Book CCSDS 131.1-O-1 (www.ccsds.org(link is external)). These codes include 9 codes, of rates 1/2, 2/3, and 4/5 and input blocklengths 1024, 4096, and 16384, and a rate 7/8 code of input blocklength 7136. The design should be capable of switching in real-time between decoders for any of the 10 codes, and have a throughput of at least 50 Mbps.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications and Navigation ,O1.02Precision Spacecraft and Lunar/Planetary Surface Navigation and Tracking, GSFC," GRC, JPL, JSC","This call for proposals is meant to serve NASA's ever-evolving set of missions, which require precise tracking of spacecraft position and velocity in order to achieve mission success. The call seeks evolutionary improvements in modularity, sustainability, cost, and performance for current space navigation concepts that support the Vision for Space Exploration. This includes Projects Constellation, Mars Exploration Program, robotic servicing, and robotic Earth and space science missions. NASA also seeks disruptive navigation concepts that might not match the modularity, sustainability, cost, and/or performance of current technologies and their near-term evolution, but have convincingly demonstrable potential to overtake the evolution of current technologies within the future development of Project Constellation, and Earth and space science missions, in the 2015 - 2020 timeframes. While the definition of ""precise"" depends upon the mission context, typical interplanetary scenarios have required Earth-based radiometric ranging accuracies of order 1-2m at 1 AU, Doppler to 0.03 mm/sec, and plane-of-sky angles to 2.5 nano-radians. While some legacy applications remain at 2.3 GHz, most current tracking is being done at 8.4 GHz. Forward looking demonstrations are being planned at 32 GHz. These radiometric techniques have been complimented by optical techniques which achieve ~1.5 micro-radian angular accuracy upon target approach. The accuracy of radio-based techniques is typically limited by one's ability to calibrate the path delay through intervening media (troposphere, ionosphere) and by the phase stability of electronics in both the spacecraft and ground systems. For both media and electronics, the stability goal is to achieve Allan standard deviations of 4e-15 at 100 seconds and 1.5e-15 at 1e3 to 1e4 seconds while maintaining, or improving upon, current levels of reliability. Space navigation technology concepts should support launch and return to Earth, including range safety, early orbit operations, in-space assembly, cis-lunar and interplanetary transit, libration point transit and orbit, lunar and planetary approach and orbit, ascent and descent from lunar and planetary surfaces, including precision landing, automated rendezvous and docking, and formation flying spacecraft forming synthetic apertures for science imaging and interferometry. Surface navigation technology concepts should support communications and navigation surface networks involving rovers and/or astronauts on a lunar and/or other planetary environment. NASA considers applicability to multiple operational regimes through modularity and/or missionization of common components a key element in its exploration strategy. Space navigation systems must produce accurate long-term trajectory predictions as well as definitive epoch solutions. Surface navigation systems must produce accurate dead-reckoning over long traverses. Where applicable, proposed concepts should be interoperable with and/or leverage the resources of NASA's space communications architecture. All navigation systems should be compatible, where applicable, to continuous or near-continuous trajectory perturbations generated by onboard spacecraft systems. All concepts must show some significant advantages over current techniques in at least one of the following areas: accuracy, cost, reliability, modularity, sustainability, or for onboard systems, mass, power, and volume. Innovative technologies are sought in the following areas: Highly phase-stable RF ground systems are critical to high accuracy radiometric tracking. Present systems rely upon analog transmission over 0.5 to 10 km distances of a broadband (100 - 600 MHz) spectrum. Transmission induced phase errors could be greatly reduced by developing highly phase stable digital sampling and time tagging systems that can be placed near (~10m) to the RF feedhorn without measurably degrading the RF signal capture with spurious tones and noise. Phase stability goals are given above. The sampler should Nyquist sample the 100 - 600 MHz band with at least 8-bit resolution and be capable of digitally transmitting the resulting samples over fiber optic lines; The VLBI parameter estimation software used to build the radiometric reference frames used for precise tracking relies on a Square Root Information Filter that makes use of Householder transformation techniques. These solutions often take several days of CPU time on a modern workstation. Block matrix techniques have the potential to optimize the interaction of the CPU and cache memory thereby greatly reducing the CPU time needed for solutions. The goal is a factor of three improvement in total solution time for problems with 7 million data points and 500,000 parameters, which include at least 5000 parameters that are active over the entire data set; Microwave radiometry of atmospheric emission lines (22 GHz H2O, 60 GHz O2) has been successful in demonstrating 1 mm level calibration of tropospheric path delay. However, the usefulness of this technique has been limited by the large mass and size of the instrument packages. Identifying/developing low mass, low cost implementations of this technique without significantly sacrificing accuracy would greatly enhance precise tracking; Develop low mass, (Less than 1 kg) low cost onboard radio frequency standards for generating highly phase-stable onboard radio signals which achieve Allan standard deviations of 1 x 10-15 at 1000 seconds and drift of less than 10-15/day; Develop innovative tracking technologies using new wavelengths (X-ray, Infra-red, etc.), such as systems using celestial and planetary emissions and reflections (not limited to the visible spectrum) that can produce three-dimensional absolute and relative position and velocity in regions where Earth-based GPS measurements are not available. The technologies can exploit either ground based or on-board techniques; Develop innovative technologies for improving the state-of-the-art in terms of cost and performance in making spacecraft-to-spacecraft measurements, such as omni-directional range and bearing sensors and robotic-vision-based systems; Develop innovative navigation algorithms and software supporting analysis, design, and mission operations that will reduce operations costs and support multiple systems in simultaneous, tightly-coupled, non-quiescent operations, such as robotic servicing, formation flying, or surface mobility. Systems and technologies for providing an EVA crewmember with real-time navigation and position information while traversing on foot or on a rover. This system will be especially useful when the suited crewmember is traversing on foot and cannot rely on the rover system and markers for walk-back navigation. Develop a highly integrated Ultra Wide Band (UWB) communications and tracking solution to reduce costs and provide robust performance, multipath immunity, long range one-way tracking, high precision short range tracking, high (broadband) capacity, and a transmit-only tag tracking system. RFID tags using UWB technology have been shown to provide sub-inch accuracy for close-in tracking. This precision tracking can be used to allow astronauts and robonauts to work in close proximity with reduced risk of collisions. The same UWB equipment can be used for long range tracking/wideband communications and the precise tracking at close ranges. Because of its mitigation properties, this impulse radio technology is well-suited for surface mobile area networks and reliable for simultaneous target tracking and high data rate communications in and around lunar craters. Commercial applications include precise tracking of moving oil-drill equipment, medical imaging, automobile collision-avoidance and surveillance through walls. Read less>>"
Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications and Navigation ,O1.03Communication for Space-Based Range, GSFC," AFRC, GRC, KSC","Metric tracking of launch vehicles for range safety purposes is currently based on redundant radars, telemetry receivers, and uplink command transmitters at the launch site with additional assets deployed downrange in order to maintain line-of-sight communications with the vehicle as it passes over the horizon to orbital insertion. The vision of space-based range architecture is to assure public safety, cut the costs of launch operations, enable multiple simultaneous launch operations, decrease response time, and improve geographic and temporal flexibility by reducing, or eliminating, these assets. In order to achieve this, a number of advancements in tracking and telemetry are required. Some of NASA's needs are: GPS/IMU Metric Tracking and Autonomous Systems Realization of a space-based range requires development of GPS receivers that incorporate:Low power consumption; Low mass/volume; Compliance with range safety standards; Flexible tracking loop programmability; Programmable output formats; and Operability in high G environments.Other highly desirable GPS specific characteristics include open architecture supported by development software and the capability of being incorporated onto circuit boards designed for multiple functions. Tactical grade inexpensive expendable IMUs are needed which can function on spin-stabilized rockets (up to 7 rps) and reliably function during sudden jerk and acceleration associated with launch and engine firings and can be coupled with GPS receivers. Also needed are approaches to processing and merging the independent outputs of GPS and Inertial Navigation Sensors and combining them with rule-based systems for autonomous navigation and termination decision making. Space-Based Telemetry Small, lightweight, low cost transceivers capable of establishing satellite communications links for telemetry and control during the launch and assent stages of flight are required to provide unbroken communications throughout the launch phase. These may enable use of the NASA TDRSS, or commercial communications satellite constellations. These transceivers are needed for use on suborbital and orbital platforms as well as for launch operations. While the communications support for launch vehicle operations may require continuous support for short durations in the order of less than 30 minutes other applications will be on platforms which require support for the duration the mission which could last for more than a month. Additionally it is highly desirable to limit the user burden to provide adequate EIRP and G/T for providing acceptable link margins between the constellation and the transceiver. Hence use of communications constellations in lower than GEO will be advantageous. Techniques for multiplexing narrow bandwidth channels to permit increased bit rates and improved algorithms for ensuring smooth transition of support between communications satellites are also needed. GPS Attitude Determination for Launch Vehicles Investigate using inexpensive arrays of GPS antennas and receivers on small, expendable launch vehicles to determine the attitude angles and their rates of change as an alternative to traditional inertial measurement units. The system should be contained entirely on the vehicle and not rely on ground-based processing. The attitude accuracy should be comparable to gyroscope-based systems and should be free of drift and gimble lock. The system must be able to maintain attitude output during periods of high dynamics and erratic flight. The attitude must be determined at a rate of least 10 Hz with minimal processing delay and must be output in a format compatible with vehicle telemetry systems. Integrated small, low mass, low power consumption transceiver/sensor packages are needed which can provide bidirectional communication interfaces between flight platforms such as weather balloons via the internet for the purpose of measurement of wind profiles, and atmospheric weather parameters such as temperature, humidity and ozone levels.Read less>>"
Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications and Navigation ,O1.04Antenna Technology, GRC," GSFC, JPL, JSC, LaRC","NASA seeks advanced antenna systems for use in spacecraft and planetary surface vehicles used in science, exploration systems, and space operations missions. Future human and robotic missions to the Moon and Mars will have stringent communication requirements. Highly robust communication networks will be established on-surface as part of a long-term, evolutionary mission set. Such networks will grow to consist of a large number of communication links that connect the various network nodes. Some of these nodes must also maintain continuous high data rate communication links between the surface and orbiting relays or directly to the Earth. Great demands will be placed on these communication systems to assure mission safety, robustness in harsh environments, and high reliability for long duration missions with diverse human and robotic elements. Areas of interest include very large aperture, lightweight spacecraft antenna systems, including high-gain deployable antenna architectures, multi-frequency and dual polarized antennas, self-orienting systems, phased array antennas, adaptive beam correction and pointing control, reconfigurable antennas, novel concepts, and antennas that can adapt to failed components without compromising performance and operability (e.g., smart antennas that include structural health monitoring and active control). Antenna systems for novel navigation concepts (e.g., pulsar beacons) as well as integrated communications and navigation architectures are desirable. Large inflatable membrane antennas to significantly reduce stowage volume, provide high deployment reliability, and significantly reduced mass density (i.e., High efficiency, miniature antennas with smaller than lambda square aperture size, to provide astronauts and robotics communications for surface to surface and surface to orbit for lunar, Mars, and planetary exploration missions are highly desirable. Recent new antenna research and development has shown that it is possible to design and build aperture antennas with smaller than the minimum effective aperture apertures size of dipoles. This new class of antennas can provide higher antenna gains (> 2.5 dBi) than the dipole antenna in much smaller aperture size (There is also interest in space-to-surface links at 25.5 GHz and 37 GHz. The size of reflector antennas is limited by the accuracy of the reflector surface that can be achieved and maintained on-orbit. Development of special materials and structural techniques to control their environment, etc., reduces environmentally induced surface errors and increases the maximum useable reflector size. Distortions caused by thermal gradients are inherently a large scale phenomenon. The reflector surface is usually sufficiently accurate over substantially large local areas but these areas are not on the same desired parabolic surface. An array of feed elements can be designed to illuminate the reflector with a distorted spherical wave. This distortion can be used to compensate for large scale surface error introduced by thermal gradients, gravitational and other forces, as well as manufacturing. Topics of interest include but are not limited to: Compensating Feed System for an Antenna Reflector Surface With Large Scale Distortions; Techniques for the remote Measurement of Satellite Antenna Profile Errors; Determination of Orbiting S/C Antenna Distortion by Ground-Based Measurements; Measuring and Compensating Antenna Thermal Distortions; Reflector Measurements and Corrections using arrays; and Reflector Distortion Measurement and Compensation Using Array Feeds. NASA is interested in low cost phased array antennas for suborbital vehicles such as sounding rockets, balloons, UAV's, and expendable vehicles. The frequencies of interest are S-band, Ku-band, and Ka-band. The arrays are required to be aerodynamic in shape for the sounding rockets, UAV's, and expendable platforms. The balloon vehicles primarily communicate with TDRS and can tolerate a wide range of mechanical dimensions. Antenna pointing techniques and technologies for Ka-band spacecraft antennas that can provide spacecraft knowledge with sub-milliradian precision (e.g., NASA is designing arrays of ground-based antennas to serve the telecommunications needs of future space exploration. Medium-size (12m class) antennas have been selected for receiving, and arrays of hundreds of them are expected to be required. Applications include communication with distant spacecraft; radar studies of solar system objects; radio astronomy; and perhaps other scientific uses. A significant challenge is the implementation of an array for transmitting (uplinking), which may or may not use the same antennas that are used for receiving. The uplink frequency will be in the 7.1 - 8.6 GHz range (X-band) in the near term, and may be in the 31.5 - 33.0 GHz band (Ka-Band) in the future; it will likely carry digital modulation at rates from 10 kbps to 30 Mbps. An EIRP of at least 500 GW is required, and some applications contemplate an EIRP as high as 10 TW. It is also desirable to support as many as ten simultaneously-operating deep-space missions from one complex on Earth, and to have at least three geographically separated complexes so communication is possible with a given spacecraft at any time of the day. The major challenges in the uplink array design are: Minimizing the life-cycle cost of an array that produces a given EIRP by selecting the optimum combination of antenna size, transmitter power, and number of antennas. This becomes much more difficult if the option of using the same antenna for both uplink and downlink is considered. Identifying/developing low-cost, highly reliable, easily serviceable components for key systems. This could include highly integrated RF and digital signal processing electronics, including mixed-signal ASICs. It could also include low-cost, high-volume antenna manufacturing techniques. (For the receiving array, another key component is a cryogenic refrigerator for the 15 - 25K temperature range.) Also, low-cost transmitters, including medium-power of the order of 100's of watts amplifiers, are desirable. Phase calibration techniques are required to ensure coherent addition of the signals from individual antennas at the spacecraft. It is important to understand whether space-based techniques are required or ground-based techniques are adequate. In general, a target spacecraft in deep space cannot be used for calibration because of the long round-trip communication delay. Design of ultra phase-stable electronics to maintain the relative phase among antennas. These will minimize the need for continuous, extensive and/or disruptive calibrations. Understanding the effect of the medium (primarily the Earth's troposphere) on the coherence of the signals at the target spacecraft. Generally, turbulence in the medium tends to disrupt the coherence in a way that is time-dependent and site-dependent. A quantitative understanding of this is needed. Techniques for integrating a very low-noise, cryogenically-cooled receiver with a medium power (1W to 200W) transmitter. If transmitters and receivers are combined on the same antenna, the performance of each should be compromised as little as possible, and the low cost and high reliability should be maintained. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and it should show a path toward a Phase 2 hardware demonstration that will, when appropriate, deliver a demonstration unit for testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications and Navigation ,O1.05Reconfigurable/Reprogrammable Communication Systems, GRC," GSFC, JPL, JSC","NASA seeks novel approaches in reconfigurable, reprogrammable communication systems to enable the Vision for Space Exploration, Science, and Space Operations. Exploration of the Moon and Mars will require advancements in communication systems to manage the demands of the harsh space environment on space electronics, maintain flexibility and adaptability to changing needs and requirements, and provide flexibility and survivability due to increased mission durations. NASA missions can have vastly different transceiver requirements and available resources depending on the science objective, operating environment, and spacecraft resources. For example, deep space missions are often power constrained; operating over large distances, and subsequently have lower data transmission rates when compared to near-Earth or near planetary satellites. These requirements and resource limitations are known prior to launch; therefore, the scalability feature can be used to maximize transceiver effi-ciency while minimizing resources consumed. Larger platforms such as vehicles or relay spacecraft may provide more resources but may also be expected to perform more complex functions or support multiple and simultaneous communication links to a diverse set of assets. This subtopic seeks advancements in reconfigurable transceiver and component technology, providing flexible, reconfigurable capability while minimizing on-board resources and cost. The use of open standards within the software radio development is desirable while minimizing potential increased resources and inefficiencies. Topics of interest include the development of software defined radios or radio subsystems which demonstrate reconfigurability, flexibility, reduced power consumption of digital signal processing systems, increased performance and bandwidth, reduced software qualification cost, and error detection and mitigation techniques. Complex reconfigur-able systems will provide multiple channel and simultaneous waveforms. Areas of interest can be divided as follows: Signal Waveforms and On-Orbit Reconfiguration Multiple waveforms and multiple channel support strive to reduce radio count to reduce power consumption of the overall communication system. Tradeoffs in radio count and radio complexity are considered in the analysis. Reconfiguration for software and firmware upgrades shall provide access control, authentication, and data integrity checks for the reconfiguration process. Partial reconfigurable logic allows simultaneous operation and upload of new waveforms or functions. Upon operator or automated load detection failure, capability to provide access back to a known, reliable operational state is needed. An automated restore capability ensures the system can revert to a baseline configuration, thereby avoiding permanent communications loss do to an errant reconfiguration process. Approaches should minimize size and power consumption for deep space transceivers incorporating fault tolerant, reprogrammable digital signal processing devices. Implementations demonstrating the concept function, and benefits of dynamic or distributed on-board processing architectures to provide maximum reconfigurability and processing capacity are sought. A common processing system capacity for communications, science, and health monitoring is envisioned. Demonstration of adaptive modulation and waveform recognition techniques are desired to provide capability to reconfigure to the waveform identified based on an on-board library or enable new waveform upload to the on-board library from the ground. Software Architecture, Implementation, Modeling and Verification Development and demonstration of low overhead, low complexity hardware and software architectures to enable software component or design reuse, or common testing standards that demonstrates cost or time savings. Emphasis on the application of open standards architecture to facilitate interoperability among different vendors to minimize the operational impact of upgrading hardware and software components. Methods (i.e., Hardware Abstraction Layers) that enable portability among reconfigurable logic hardware devices among different vendors, different device families and types of digital processing technologies. As the use of software and firmware increases with more flexible and portable software defined radio technologies, methods are sought to reduce the complexity and cost to space qualify and verify software operation for use in space yet maintain or increase on-orbit reliability. Techniques to ensure reliable software execution and failure detection and self-correction. One promise of software defined radios is software and design reuse maintained in a common repository. The cost or ability to reuse software depends on implementation, development practices, code complexity and other circumstances. This subtopic seeks the development and demonstration of software tools or tool chain methodologies to enable both design and software code reuse. The Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) architecture incorporates the development of an open architecture for NASA Software Defined Radios for space. The STRS standard includes software/firmware and hardware compliance rules that must be followed to comply with the standard. A tools suite that autonomously implements accurate and repeatable tests is required to verify infrastructure, waveform, and hardware STRS compliance. The tool suite must be extendable as the STRS architecture expands to incorporate additional requirements. Innovative solutions are sought under this solicitation to develop the requirements, top level design objectives, and top level design of the compliance tools. The recommended solutions must not incorporate proprietary products or solutions. Fault Tolerance The use of reconfigurable logic devices in software defined radios is expected to increase in the future to provide reconfigurability and on-orbit flexibility for waveforms and applications. As the densities of these devices continue to increase and feature size decreases, the susceptibility of the electronics to single event effects also increases. Novel approaches to mitigate single event effects caused by charged particles are sought that reduces power consumption and complexity compared to traditional approaches (i.e., voting schemes and constant updates (scrubbing)). Techniques and implementations to provide a core waveform capability within the software defined radio in the event of failure or disruption of the primary waveform and/or system hardware. Communication loss should be detected and core or ""gold"" waveform automatically executed to provide control access to the diagnostic system and over-the-air reload operational waveform and control software. Radio Architectures Innovative solutions to provide software defined radio implementations to reduce power consumption and mass. Solutions should promote modularity and common, open interfaces. Software defined radio implementations that enable future hardware scalability among different mission classes (e.g., low rate deep space to moderate or high rate near planetary, or relay spacecraft).

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications and Navigation ,O1.06Miniaturized Digital EVA Radio, JSC, GRC,"With NASA now planning future sustained manned lunar outpost missions, the need is paramount for a reliable, robust, lightweight, and compact EVA software radio capable of achieving enhanced performance and efficiency on any of the following frequency bands of interest: UHF (401 - 402 Mhz, 25khz bandwidth), S-band (2.4 - 2.483 GHz), and Ka-band (22.55 - 23.55 GHz). Assume multi-point RF communications and simultaneous links to suit/vehicles at 10 km range and RF contingency voices at UHF half-duplex. Due to menacing dust storms, frequency agility will be necessary during periods of disruptions. The programmable radio must support multiple bandwidths and data transmissions of telemetry, voice, and high-rate video. Assume bi-directional link and 20 Mbps maximum data rate. Solutions should include adaptive techniques to accommodate changing propagation and interference. Small volume and low mass are always sought for human missions to enhance astronaut mobility on planetary surface. Operational scenarios dictate that EVA radios transmit audio, telemetry, and high-rate video to surface rovers, lander, and habitats, and other astronauts. Proposers must address EVA radio relay communications to surmount obscurations or poor line-of-sight to any surface nodes described above. Pioneering astronauts exploring the surface of the Moon will also require a network enabling not only communications but precision relative navigation to keep these explorers abreast of their position relative to each other and lunar assets out to a maximum of 10 km. NASA needs systems and technologies to provide an EVA crewmember with real-time navigation and position information while traversing on foot or in a rover. This system will be apt when the suited crewmember is traversing on foot and cannot rely on the rover system and markers for walk-back navigation. Because EVA radio is battery operated, power consumption should be minimized. This solicitation seeks to develop a highly integrated multi-band multi-mode EVA adaptive intelligent programmable radio, a network that enables navigation between mobile and fixed communicating nodes, and required middleware technologies. Assume a stand-alone overlay or perhaps an embedded layer in a pre-existing, CDMA, OCDMA, ODFM, VOFDM or TDMA packet communication environment. In addition, EVA radio must dynamically and adaptively conserve power consumption on the fly packet-by-packet while maintaining interoperability among nodes. Both communication and navigation functions of the network must assure 3D tracking and navigation accuracy, a BER of 10e-8 or better, and graceful degradation. As a minimum, the proposed communications network concept must be capable of stand alone operation, independent of any other communication or navigation asset, and be capable of delivering high data rate or variable data rate digital communication ranging from voice to imagery transmissions while continually delivering bearing and pseudo-ranges between nodes within the network. With ever-increasing versatility of the emerging programmable radios, NASA also needs a more potent approach to energy conservation - one that matches the QoS requirement, channel condition, and the interference environment to the most energy efficient operating point of the EVA radio. This requires an intelligent and/or cognitive middleware to draw QoS information from the application, plus channel and interference information from the PHY. Thus, the middleware identifies the unique PHY and MAC combinations that results in minimal energy operation. As the number of modes delivered on the QoS increases, choosing the mode with the least energy profile must lead to substantial energy savings and battery life extension. The evolutionary use of Software Defined Radios and the emergence of technologies such as multi-antenna have resulted in radio systems that can easily support 1000s of unique modes. Coupled with the presence of heavy interference like dust storms and channel impairments, the minimal energy mode of operation must be identified. Proposed solutions must achieve energy consumption of 5x to 10x reduction in total power consumption, depending upon the richness of and diversity of modes available on the target radio. All software must be portable to any radio platform. Phase 1 Deliverables: Propose a robust multi-band miniaturized frequency-agile EVA software defined radio suitable for applications and bands. Address all technical MEMS challenges, pitfalls, and tradeoffs of EVA radio size, weight, power as well as reliability, complexity, and performance. Solutions should encompass a notional architecture,functional requirements, and building block concepts, demonstrating a reliable and simultaneous voice, telemetry, and video transmission as well as reconfigurability across multiple applications and frequency bands. Special interests include single-chip design/packaging and RF MEMs technologies to realize compact radios under 5 lbs. Develop suitable communication and navigation 3D tracking network system and algorithms capable of demonstrating the feasibility of the approach. Integrated communication and navigation solutions must include tracking, locating, identifying tagging assets with multiple routes over an operational range of 10 km - even if they descend in craters. Based on a minimum of three nodes, simulate the performance of the proposed integrated communications and navigation network architecture and conduct sensitivity analysis for the selected implementation strategy. Develop the required middleware to properly characterize it in simulation. Achieve minimal power consumption by proper mode selection and perform demonstrated with five unique radio models including EVA. Conduct trades and identify the right set of required parameters for the ideal radio for such middleware. Quantify performance in terms of energy savings and the ability of the middleware to maximize connectivity and throughput in a mobile ad hoc network. Phase 2 Deliverables: Develop a EVA multi-band compact, lightweight, reconfigurable radio hardware prototype unit with multi-functional capabilities described in above. Further enhance the concepts investigated in Phase 1 and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on an actual platform. Fabricate and test a prototype with a minimum of 3 nodes using an active multi-node integrated communication and navigation network. Simulate and refine navigation and/or power software algorithms for real time robust operations and characterize system performance in compliance with the design goals outlined in Phase 1.Read less>>"
Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications and Navigation ,O1.07Transformational Communications Technology, GRC, JSC,"NASA seeks revolutionary, highly innovative, ""transformational"" communications technologies that have the potential to enable order of magnitude performance improvements for exploration systems, science, and space operations mission applications. The promise of high-performance, multi-functional, nano-structured materials has led to intense interest in developing them for near-term applications for human spaceflight and exploration. These materials, notably single wall carbon nano-tubes, exhibit extraordinary mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties at the nano-scale and possess exceptionally high surface area. The development of ultra-capacitors and nano-scale communication devices and systems including FET arrays, nano-antennas, nano-transceivers are of interest for nano-space applications. Phase 1 must convincingly show the proposed technology will have performance better than the equivalent legacy technology. For example, for a fixed-SAW oscillator part replacement, specific objectives include low power consumption ( 10 dBm), low spurious output (harmonics attenuated by 30 dBc), low-voltage operation (Research interests focus on, but are not limited to, the following areas: Innovative methods of using X-ray or radio pulsar signals for precise navigation or positioning of spacecraft. Small, low mass, reliable detectors, improvements in position accuracy, digital signal processing advances for time of arrival, drift estimation, and position estimation. Development of nano-scale communication devices and systems (e.g., FET arrays, nano-antennas, nano-transceivers, etc.), which can enable nano-spacecraft applications. Quantum entanglement or other innovative breakthroughs in quantum information physics to specifically address curious effects and critical unknowns relevant to revolutionary improvements in communicating data, information or knowledge between independent entities across space-time are sought. Methods and techniques to demonstrate extremely novel means of effectively packaging, storing, encrypting, and/or transferring information or knowledge. Breakthrough power-efficiency in communications brought about through the use of natural phenomenon (e.g., soliton pulse/wave/energy propagation). RF Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) devices. Besides low spatial volume, lightweight, and low-power consumption, these devices are also attractive to operate as high Q components and perform frequency selectivity - namely, agile pre-selectors, multi-couplers, and diplexers. Selectivity, or Q, for band pass filters currently comes at an unacceptably high penalty in size and mass. For example, most high rejection diplexers for space-based radios are almost as enormous as the modern radio package itself. To build and design high performance, tightly coupled, low volume space radios, compact selectivity-determining devices are a critical enabler. Most high Q filters above 400MHz, such as inter-digital filters and others involving resonant cavities, are wholly mechanical assemblies which can be ""folded"" in their design and lend themselves to micro machining techniques Other rich areas of investigation may lie within the area between MEMS and Micro-Machined devices, including electromechanically tuned filters, 3D micro machined RF resonators, filter configurations consisting of cantilevered structures, as well as carbon nano-tube waveguides. Develop, apply and demonstrate advantages of RF MEMS circuitry that proliferate the implementation of next-generation lightweight communications systems (e.g., extravehicular activity (EVA) radios).

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications and Navigation ,O1.10Surface Networks and Orbit Access Links, GRC," GSFC, JPL, JSC","Surface Networks Exploration of lunar and planetary surfaces will require short-range (~ 25 km), bi-directional, and robust multiple point links to provide on-demand, disruption-tolerant, and autonomous interconnection among surface-based assets. Some of the nodes will be fixed, such as base stations and relays to orbital assets, and some will be moving, such as rovers and humans. The ability to meet the demanding environment presented by lunar and planetary surfaces will encompass the development and integration of a number of communication and networking technologies and protocols, including: Low power, space-rated Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for wireless network products: short range ( Fixed, long range ( Integrated tracking, timing, and navigation services which will determine locations of human and robotic assets on the lunar surface, providing them to relevant entities; Self-healing, ad hoc, disruption tolerant network protocols for intelligent, autonomous link management and reliability; Non-line-of-sight communication between stationary and moving assets, outside or inside lunar craters; Autonomous surface navigation and hazard avoidance systems for robotic and fixed assets; Analog voice-only radio service to the lunar outpost and the lunar relay satellite at the highest network priority for HF, UHF, or S-band. In addition, to meet the stringent demands of continuous interoperable communications, human exploration needs to develop delay and tolerant networking (DTN) protocols that exploit persistent storage on mobile and stationary nodes to ensure timely and reliable delivery of data even when no stable end-to-end paths exist. Many networks straddle a continuum of disruption, from an almost-always connected network where a contemporaneous end-to-end path does exist, to highly intermittently connected networks where such a path seldom exists. More than disruption tolerant, solutions must exploit stability when it exists to nearly approximate the performance of conventional Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) protocols. Proposals should address the following areas: Technical challenges posed by the design considerations enumerated above and assess tradeoffs of disruption, load, storage, topology, and delivery ratio; Demonstrate adaptive DTN routing via simulations; Develop proof-of-concept nodes complete with the networking algorithms developed as part of the funded work; Demonstrate unique communications in networks that suffer from severe disruptions and delays with adaptive routing developed in Phase 1; Develop a prototype convergence layer adapter plug-in for an Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) radio.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications and Navigation ,O1.11Software for Space Communications Infrastructure Operations, JPL," ARC, GRC, GSFC","The current infrastructure for NASA Space Communications provides services for near-Earth spacecraft and deep-space planetary missions. The infrastructure assets include the Deep Space Network (DSN), the Ground Network (GN), and the Space Network (SN). Recent planning for the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) for human exploration to the Moon and beyond as well as maintaining vibrant space and Earth science programs resulted in a new concept of the communications architecture. The future communications architecture will evolve from the present legacy assets and with the addition of new assets (e.g., new large scale arrays under consideration, for further information see Space Communications Architecture Working Group report - link below). New technology is sought to improve resource optimization and the user interface of planning and scheduling tools. The software created should have a commercialization approach with the new modules fitting into an existing or in-development planning and scheduling tool. Proposals are sought in the following three areas: Intelligent Assistants In order to automate the user's provision of requirements and refinement of the schedule, ""intelligent assistant"" software should manage the user interface. Assistants should streamline access and modification of requirement and schedule information. By modeling the user, this software can adjust the level of autonomy by determining what decisions should be made by the user or the automated system. Assistants should try to minimize user involvement without making decisions the user would prefer to make. The assistants should adapt to the user by learning their control preferences. This technology should apply to local/centralized and collaborative scheduling. In a conflict-aware scheduling system (especially in a collaborative scheduling environment), conflicts are prevalent. With the concept of one big schedule from the beginning of time, real time, to the end of time, resolving conflicts become a difficult task especially since resolving conflicts in a local sense may affect the global schedule. Therefore, an intelligent assistant may provide decision support to the system or the users to assist conflict resolution. This may involve a set of rules combining with certain local/global optimization to generate a list of options for the system or users to choose from. Resource Optimization The goal of schedule optimization is to produce allocations that yield the best objectives. These may include maximizing DSN utilization, minimizing loss of desired tracking time, and optimizing project satisfaction. Each project may have their own definition of satisfaction such as maximal science data returned, maximal tracking time, best allocation of the day/week, etc. The difficulty is that we may not satisfy all of these objectives during the optimization process. Obviously, optimal solution for one objective may produce worse results for the other objectives. One possible solution is to map all of these objectives to an overall system goal. This mapping is normally non-linear. Technology needs to be developed for this non-linear mapping for scoring in addition to regular optimization approaches. Multiple Agents In an environment where all system variables can be controlled by a single controller, an optimal solution for the objective function can be achieved by finding the right set of variables. In a collaborative environment with multiple decision makers where each decision maker can only control a subset of the variables, modeling and optimization become a very complex issue. In the proposed collaborative scheduling approach, there are many users/agents that will control their own allocations with interaction with the others. How we model their interactions and define system policy so the interaction can achieve the overall system goal is an important topic. The approach for multiple decision-maker collaboration has been studied in the area of Game Theory. The applications cover many areas including economics and engineering. The major solutions include Pareto, Nash, and Stackelberg. There are many new research areas including incentive control, collaborative control, Ordinal Games, etc. Note that intelligent assistants and multiple agents represent different points on the spectrum of automation. Current operations utilize primarily manual collaborative scheduling, intelligent assistants would enhance users ability to participate in this process and intelligent agents could more automate individual customers scheduling. Ideally, proposed intelligent assistants and distributed agents would also be able to represent customers who do not wish to expose their general preferences and constraints. A start for reference material on this subtopic may be found at the following: http://ai.jpl.nasa.gov in the publications area; http://scp.gsfc.nasa.gov/gn/gnusersguide3.pdf, NASA Ground Network User's Guide, Chapter 9 Scheduling; http://scp.gsfc.nasa.gov/tdrss/guide.html, Space Network User's Guide, SpaceOps Conference Proceedings; and https://www.spacecomm.nasa.gov/spacecomm/, Space Communications Architecture Working Group Report.The proposal should explicitly include an operations scenario of before and after the inclusion of the new technology.Read less>>"

Space Operations,Topic O2 Space Transportation ,O2.02Space Transportation Propulsion System and Test Facility Requirements and Instrumentation, SSC," GRC, MSFC","Ground testing of propulsion systems continues to be critical in meeting NASA's strategic goals. Relevant ground testing technologies and capabilities are crucial to the development, qualification, and acceptance process of validating cargo launch vehicles and human rated vehicles including Crew Exploration Vehicles (CEV), CEV Launch Systems, Cargo Launch Vehicle (CLV), and Lunar Surface Access Modules propulsion systems. The ability to quickly and efficiently perform system certification greatly impacts all space programs. Proposals are sought in the following areas: Instrumentation and Sensors NASA's Stennis Space Center (SSC) is concerned with expanding its suite of non-intrusive technologies that provide information on propulsion system health, the environments produced by the plumes and the effects of plumes and constituents on facilities and the environment. Current capabilities include non-intrusive optical methods of monitoring plumes for metallic contamination from erosion and wear, measuring the radiative and acoustic energies and as well as measuring the concentrations of environmentally sensitive species. SSC also requires facility health management technologies to monitor the physical health of testing infrastructure to improve the sustainability and reliability of the test facilities and components. Engine Health Monitoring Innovative, standalone sensors for non-intrusively measuring physical properties of rocket engine plumes. Measurements of interest include, but are not limited to, species, temperature, density, velocities, combustion stability and O/F measurement. Plume Environments Measurements: Advanced instrumentation and sensors to monitor the near field and far field effects and products of exhaust plumes. Examples are the levels of acoustic energy, thermal radiation and final exhaust species that will effect the environment. Facility Monitoring Advanced instrumentation and sensors for process monitoring in high pressure 12,000 psi and high flow rate 100 lb/sec gas and cryogenic environments. Applications include cryogenic level sensing, fast response/high accuracy cryogenic temperature sensors. Facility response and analysis capabilities for monitoring facility structure, process systems and test article interaction. These include dynamic response, structural fatigue and pipe system health. Integrated System Health Management (ISHM) Capability for Rocket Engine Testing and Ground Operations ISHM capability is achieved by integrating data, information, and knowledge (DIaK) that might be distributed throughout the system elements (which inherently implies capability to manage DIaK associated with distributed sub-systems). DIaK must be available to any element of a system at the right time and within proper context. ISHM capability is measured by how well a system performs the following functions:Detect anomalies; Diagnose causes; Predict future anomalies/failures; Provide the user with an integrated awareness about the condition of every element in the system and guide user decisions.The technologies of interest to this topic include:Algorithms/approaches/methodologies for anomaly detection; Approaches and methodologies for root-cause analysis to diagnose causes of anomalies; Approaches and methodologies for prediction of future anomalies; Architectures/Taxonomies/Ontologies (management of DIaK - where management implies distributed storage, sharing, processing, maintenance, configuration); Software environments that integrate contributing technologies in a modular plug-and-play fashion, adhering to a defined architecture/taxonomy/ontology; User interfaces to provide the user integrated system awareness; Intelligent elements (e.g., sensors, valves, pumps, etc.). Computational Modeling Tools and Methods Developing and verifying test facilities is complex and expensive. The wide range of pressures, flow rates, and temperatures necessary for engine testing result in complex relationships and dynamics. It is not realistic to physically test each component and the component-to-component interaction in all states before designing a system. Currently, systems must be tuned after fabrication, requiring extensive testing and verification. Tools using computational methods to accurately model and predict system performance are required that integrate simple interfaces with detailed design and/or analysis software. SSC is interested in improving capabilities and methods to accurately predict and model the transient fluid structure interaction between cryogenic fluids and immersed components to predict the dynamic loads, frequency response of facilities.

Launch delays due to difficulty in verifying a cleared range are common and will increase as development encroaches on existing spaceports and as spaceports are built in new areas. Proposals are sought for innovative sensors, instrumentation platforms, and communication technologies which expedite range clearance by providing real-time situational awareness for range operations such as launches, hazardous processing, and recovery. Instrumentation platforms will provide mobile or transportable surveillance assets for broad area coverage to meet range needs. These platforms should be capable of a high degree of self-sufficiency and autonomy for unattended, long-term operations. During operations the platform must maintain stability so that instru-ments are not required to compensate for unique environmental characteristics surrounding the operations. Platforms may include, but are not limited to, Unpiloted Aerial Vehicles (UAV), High Altitude Airships (HAA), buoys, etc. Instrumentation and sensors would include but not be limited to a wide spectrum of optical, infrared, Radio Frequency (RF), and millimeter wave. These would provide for the detection, recognition, and identification of persons and objects that have intruded areas of the range that must be cleared in order to conduct safe launch operations. In addition, multiple sensors and instruments may be used, or combined through the use of neural networks and data fusion, for accurate identification, and time and position of entities. Centric and integrated communications schemes that adhere to widely accepted standards will enable a scalable architecture for range instrumentation that supports launch operations. Data rates and bandwidth requirements may vary greatly depending on instrumentation and sensors that are incorporated on a range. These constraints and the distributed nature of a range dictate the need to include multiple communication media such as free-space optics, Wi-Fi, and terrestrial and space-based communications links in order to transport the collected data.

Space Operations,Topic O3 Processing and Operations ,O3.02In-helmet Speech Audio Systems and Technologies, GRC," ARC, JSC, KSC","The space suit environment presents a unique challenge for capturing and transmitting speech communications to and from a crewmember. The in-suit acoustic environment is characterized by highly reflective surfaces, causing high levels of reverberation, as well as spacesuit-unique noise fields. Known sources of noise within the suit are both stationary and transient in nature. Noise within the suit can be acoustically borne or it can originate from structure-borne vibration. Noise originates from suit machinery, footfalls, suit arm and hip bearing, body movement noise and turbulent flow noise from devices such as oxygen spray bars and breath noise. Static pressure levels within the spacesuit can range from a small fraction of an atmosphere during Extravehicular Activity (EVA) operations to strong hyperbaric conditions that exist during terrestrial field-testing. These changes in static pressure level have significant effects on acoustic transduction. Additionally, in some spacesuits, the crewmember is afforded a wide range of motion within the torso of the suit. The wide range of motion means that the acoustic path between a crewmember's mouth or ear and the microphone or helmet mounted speaker varies significantly with movement, resulting in decreased sound pressure levels at the microphone and/or increased interference from competing background noise sources. In addition, vehicular operations can generate high levels of noise that are not fully attenuated by the spacesuit, helmet or headsets. Due to these factors, the quality of speech delivered to and from the inside of a spacesuit helmet can be low and can have a negative effect on inbound and outbound speech intelligibility and the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. The traditional approach to overcome the challenges of the spacesuit acoustic environment is to use a skullcap-based system of microphones and speakers. Cap-based solutions mitigate many of the acoustic problems associated with in-helmet communications systems through the very short and direct acoustic transmission paths between the crewmember and the speakers and microphones. The skullcap's headsets and noise canceling microphones can also afford some degree of acoustic isolation for the crewmember from noise generated inside the spacesuit. Cap-based systems are less successful, however, in attenuating high noise levels generated outside the spacesuit (e.g., during launch, descent, burn activities, or emergency aborts), even when coupled with the launch/entry helmet. The use of noise canceling microphones can improve speech intelligibility, but only if the microphones are in close proximity to the crewmember's mouth. Many logistical issues exist for head-mounted caps. Crewmembers are not able to adjust the skullcap, headset or microphone booms during EVA operations (which can last from four to eight hours) or during launch/entry operations. Interference between the protuberances of the cap and other devices, such as drinking/feeding tubes, is a recognized issue during EVA. Comfort, hygiene, proper positioning and dislocation are major concerns for head-mounted caps. Wire fatigue and blind mating of the connectors are also problems with the cap-based systems. In order to accommodate anthropometric variations in crew heads, multiple cap sizes are required. Issues have recently been identified with existing communications systems regarding adjustment of microphone boom lengths, proper function over the wide ranges of static pressure experienced during suited operations, flow noise over the microphone elements, and integration with advanced helmet designs.NASA is seeking systems, subsystems and/or technologies in support of improvements in speech intelligibility, speech quality, listening quality and listening effort for in-helmet aural and vocal communications. In addition, improvements in hearing protection are sought to protect the crew during all mission phases, in case hazardous acoustic levels and conditions occur. The specific focus of this SBIR subtopic is on improving the interface between crewmember and the acoustic pickup (i.e., microphones) and generation (i.e., speaker) systems. Systems and devices are sought to improve or resolve acoustic, physical and technical problems (listed above) that have been associated with skullcap-mounted speakers and microphones, or allow for the elimination of skullcap-mounted speakers and microphones. In particular, voice communications systems are sought that have provided crewmembers with adequate speech intelligibility over background noise within, and external to, the spacesuit. Overall system performance must provide Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for Listening Quality (Lq) and Listening Effort (Le) of 3.9 or greater, or Articulation Index (AI) of .7 or better or 90% Intelligibility in the crewmember's native language for both inbound and outbound speech communication. Specific technologies of interest include, but are not limited to: Acoustic modeling of the in-suit acoustic environment, including the ability to model structure-borne vibration in helmet and suit structures as well as transduction to and from the acoustic medium. Low-mass, low-volume, low-distortion, space-qualified speakers with low variation in sensitivity with static pressure. Changes in speaker sensitivity should be less than 2 dB over the speech band with changes in static pressure between 3 and 18 psia. Low-mass, low-volume, low-distortion high-sensitivity (> 5 mV/Pa), space-qualified noise canceling microphones with low variation in sensitivity with static pressure. Changes in microphone sensitivity should be less than 2 dB over the speech band with changes in static pressure between 3 and 18 psia. Attenuation of external noise by passive hearing protection that is comfortable for crewmembers during extended use.In-helmet devices will need to be compatible with high humidity, low humidity and pure oxygen environments. Devices should be able to fit a wide anthropometric range of head and physical features found within the astronaut corps. Additionally, demonstrations of novel system concepts for in-helmet audio communication are of strong interest. A partial list of such concepts includes: Near-field beamforming systems; Optical microphone systems; Highly directive sound production systems such as parametric sound systems; Active noise cancellation systems for hearing protection; Bone conduction microphones. Systems and devices must include appropriate computer processing systems. The expectation is that a working and fully functional system or device will be delivered at the end of Phase 2.Read less>>"

Specifically, this subtopic seeks technologies in support of the Integrated Vehicle Health Management Project (IVHM) that will contribute to the reduction of aircraft system and component failures and malfunctions that cause and contribute to aircraft accidents and incidents. The goal of IVHM is to develop technologies to determine system/component degradation and damage early enough to prevent or gracefully recover from in-flight failures in both the near-future and next-generation air transportation systems. These technologies will enable nearly continuous on-board situational awareness of the vehicle health state for use by the flight crew, ground crew, and maintenance depot. To achieve this, NASA will advance the state-of-the-art technology in on-board health state assessment to enable the continuous diagnosis and prognosis of the integrated vehicle's health status. To help meet this goal, NASA seeks innovative technology development activities in the following areas:Airframe Health Management - including self-awareness and prognosis, anomaly detection and identification, and in-flight damage, degradation and failure mitigation; Propulsion Health Management - including self-awareness and prognosis of gas path, combustion, and overall engine state (containment systems and rotating and static components), and fault-tolerant system architectures; Aircraft Systems Health Management - including state-awareness and prognosis of landing gear, hydraulic and pneumatic systems, electrical and power systems, fuel and lubrication systems, avionics/communications, navigation, surveillance/flight critical and flight management systems, and robust, distributed, fault-tolerant, self-recoverable architectures for flight critical aircraft applications; Environmental Hazard Management - including the prevention, detection, and mitigation of hazards such as ice accretion, lightning strikes, EMI/EMC, and ionizing radiation, as well as the direct and indirect effects of these hazards; IVHM Architectures and Databases - including system design, analysis and optimization, information management, data flow and communication, control and reconfiguration, architecture development and validation, and database development and management; Validation and Predictive Capability Assessment - including analysis, simulation, ground testing, flight testing, environmental testing, and software assurance.NASA's IVHM research will ultimately yield integrated, multi-disciplinary analysis and optimization capabilities that enable system-level designs providing graceful recovery from in-flight failures, computationally efficient tools for in-flight prognosis of aircraft health including integrated predictive and sensor capabilities, and preventative and adaptive systems for in-flight operability and informed logistics and maintenance.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.09Integrated Avionics Systems for Small Scale Remotely Operated Vechicles, LaRC," AFRC, ARC","Small scale remotely operated vehicles are becoming an increasingly attractive option for experimental research in flight dynamics, vehicle state assessment, and automatic flight control as well as a growing number of commercial applications. Small scale vehicles (nominally 20 lbs to 80 lbs total weight) place constraints on the amount of on-board avionics that can be accommodated and these systems can benefit from integration of components. For flight research activities key avionic systems are:Inertial navigation units which combine gyroscopic measurements with GPS position data; The capabilities to implement an autopilot fail-safe should RF uplink be lost; The ability to log instrumentation data from analog, pulse-width and serial stream inputs; The ability to read and generate serial-port data streams for RF communication systems; Telemetry systems to provide for both ground-based piloting and real-time data downlink. When used as experimental research test beds the requirements for data quality (resolution, bandwidth, linearity, etc.) are often higher than would be derived just for automated flight operations on the vehicle itself. Although existing commercial technology can individually address each of these areas, an integrated high-fidelity system that is commensurate with the low-power, low-weight, and EMI sensitive environment of subscale remotely piloted vehicles is not available. For safety of flight a fail-safe autopilot should be able to recover vehicle stability from a range of entry conditions and also have GPS waypoint return-and-hold or full auto landing capability. Programmability of the avionics unit is important to allow the system to be extended to a wide range of platforms, application environments, and experimental requirements. Telemetry systems are flight critical for remotely piloted vehicles and therefore must have high reliability in addition to meeting bandwidth requirements imposed by the data downlink from a fully instrumented vehicle.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.10Adaptive Structural Mode Suppression, AFRC," ARC, LaRC","NASA has initiated an Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control (IRAC) effort under the Aviation Safety Program. The main focus of the effort is to advance the state-of-the-art technology in adaptive controls to provide a design option that allows for increased resiliency to failures, damage, and upset conditions. These adaptive flight control systems will automatically adjust the control feedback and command paths to regain stability, maneuverability, and eventually a safe landing. One potential consequence of changing the control feedback and command paths is that an undesired aeroservoelastic (ASE) interaction could occur. The resulting limit cycle oscillation could result in structural damage or potentially total loss of vehicle control. Current airplanes with non-adaptive control laws usually include roll-off or notch filters to avoid ASE interactions. These structural mode suppression filters are designed to provide 8 dB of gain attenuation at the structural mode frequency. Ground Vibration Testing (GVT), Structural Mode Interaction (SMI) testing, and finally full scale flight testing are performed to verify that no adverse ASE interactions occur. Until a significant configuration or control system change occurs, the structural mode suppression filters provide adequate protection. When an adaptive system changes to respond to off-nominal rigid body behavior, the changes in control can affect the structural mode attenuation levels. In the case of a damaged vehicle, the frequency and damping of the structural modes can change. The combination of changing structural behavior with changing control system gains results in a system with a probability of adverse interactions that is very difficult to predict a priori. An onboard, measurement based method is needed to ensure that the system adjusts to attenuate any adverse ASE interaction before a sustained limit cycle and vehicle damage are encountered. This system must work in concert with the adaptive control system to allow the overall goal of re-gaining rigid body performance as much as possible without exacerbating the situation with ASE interactions. Adaptive, reconfigurable structural mode suppression methods that address the following are needed:Suppression of all ASE interactions with no a priori knowledge of structural modes; Minimal interference/interaction with rigid body controller; Implementable in a real-time flight control processor.Research areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:Adaptive filtering techniques; Self-tuning notch filters; ASE modeling and predictive techniques; Online margin measurement techniques; Online identification of structural vibrations; Global stability proofs for adaptive systems.

This will necessitate the development of safety-critical, real-time, distributed, embedded sensing and computing system design, development, integration, and assessment capability for applications with huge numbers of sensing and computing nodes which are networked and dynamically reconfigurable in response to changing physical conditions, modes of operation, failures, damage, and environmental disturbances. Furthermore, the development of advanced anomaly detection, prognostic, and diagnostic architectures will be required. The architecture will be designed to optimize multi-dimensional/objective criteria, enable optimal adaptive redundancy management, support large-scale data, decision, and information fusion, and meet safety, cost, and performance criteria for the IVHM system. However, the development of such a vehicle-wide system must be done by many teams of different disciplines at different locations. Therefore, a standard project database is needed that stores and manages test data, failure statistics, fault modes and effects, diagnostic and prognostic models, simulations, and related documentation for all the systems, subsystems, and components that are part of the complex system for which an IVHM system is being developed. The IVHM database must also allow for seamless integration with a variety of IVHM algorithms, including data mining, machine learning, and exploratory data analysis tools, in order to enable algorithm development and knowledge discovery using the same database of historical data. The IVHM database will be owned and operated by NASA and will be provided as a service to the aircraft industry, U.S. government, and the R&D community. The database will provide industry standard access controls to protect proprietary data rights as well as to ensure compliance with ITAR and EAR restrictions. Additionally, design tools/decision support systems that enable the design of aircraft while accounting for the sensing, processing, and data mining/analysis needs of IVHM is vital. These tools/systems must enable the designers and the analysts/discipline specialists to work together, rather than as separate entities, and must allow IVHM system design, including study of IVHM system tradeoffs, at the early aircraft design stage.

Advances are needed in compositional verification that will enable the safe integration of complex adaptive systems with strong guarantees of integrity, fault-tolerance, partitioning, and real-time. New tools, methods, and processes are needed for the V&V of diagnostic algorithms with non-deterministic behavior. The goal of the V&V research is to enable compelling evidence that required system properties are guaranteed by the composition of constituent parts, and to develop tools, methods and processes that mitigate concerns about design validity, safety, and reliability for complex, nondeterministic software-intensive systems.

Aeroelastic behavior of flight vehicles is a particularly challenging facet of that goal.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics ,A2.05Aerodynamics, LaRC," AFRC, ARC, GRC","The challenge of flight has at its foundation the understanding, prediction, and control of fluid flow around complex geometries - aerodynamics. Aerodynamic prediction is critical throughout the flight envelope for subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic vehicles - driving outer mold line definition, providing loads to other disciplines, and enabling environmental impact assessments in areas such as emissions, noise, and aircraft spacing. In turn, high confidence prediction enables high confidence development and assessment of innovative aerodynamic concepts. This subtopic seeks innovative physics-based models and novel aerodynamic concepts, with an emphasis on flow control, applicable in part or over the entire speed regime from subsonic through hypersonic flight. All vehicle classes will experience subsonic flight conditions. The most fundamental issue is the prediction of flow separation onset and progression on smooth, curved surfaces, and the control of separation. Supersonic and hypersonic vehicles will experience supersonic flight conditions. Fundamental to this flight regime is the sonic boom, which to date has been a barrier issue for a viable civil vehicle. Addressing boom alone is not a sufficient mission enabler however, as low drag is a prerequisite for an economically viable vehicle, whether only passing through the supersonic regime, or cruising there. Atmospheric entry vehicles and space access vehicles will experience hypersonic flight conditions. Reentry capsules such as the new Crew Exploration Vehicle deploy multiple parachutes during descent and landing. Predicting the physics of unsteady flows in supersonic and subsonic speeds is important for the design of these deceleration systems. The gas-dynamic performance of decelerators for vehicles entering the atmospheres of planets in the solar system is not well understood. Reusable hypersonic vehicles will be designed such that the lower body can be used as an integrated propulsion system in cruise condition. Their performance is likely to suffer in off-design conditions, particularly acutely at transonic speeds. Advanced flow control technologies are needed to alleviate the problem. This solicitation seeks proposals to develop and validate: Turbulence models capturing the physics of separation onset at Reynolds numbers relevant to flight, where relevant to flight is dependent on a targeted vehicle class and mission profile; Boundary-layer transition models suitable for direct integration with state-of-the-art flow solvers; Active flow control concepts targeted at separation control and/or viscous drag reduction with an emphasis on the development of novel, practical, lightweight, low-energy actuators; Innovative aerodynamic concepts targeted at vehicle efficiency or control; Physics-based models for simultaneous low boom/low drag prediction and design; Aerodynamic concepts enabling simultaneous low boom and low drag objectives; Innovative methods to validate both flow models and aerodynamic concepts with an emphasis on aft-shock effects which are hindered by conventional wind tunnel model mounting approaches; Accurate aerodynamic analysis and multidisciplinary design tools for multi-body flexible structures in the atmospheres of planets and moons including the Earth, Mars, and Titan; Advanced flow control technologies to alleviate off-design performance penalties for reusable hypersonic vehicles.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics ,A2.06Aerothermodynamics, LaRC," AFRC, ARC, GRC","Development of accurate tools to predict aerothermal environments and their effects on space vehicles is critically important to achieving the goals of current NASA missions, and to enable the development of advanced spacecraft for future missions by reducing uncertainties during design and development. Radiative heating was not critical for the Space Shuttle Orbiter, due to its relatively low re-entry velocity, or for entry probes such as Genesis and Stardust, due to their small size. However, the large size and high reentry velocity of the Crew Exploration Vehicle make it imperative to study shock layer radiation phenomena. The conditions encountered in proposed aerocapture missions to Titan, Neptune, and Venus also require study of radiative heat transfer and non-equilibrium thermodynamic and transport properties; these in turn require understanding of the internal structure and dynamics of the constituent gases. Transition and turbulence effects are particularly complex in hypersonic flows, where special problems are posed by shocks, real gas effects, non-smooth body surfaces with complex and possibly time-dependent roughness distribution, nose bluntness, ablation, surface catalyticity, separation, and the unknown free-stream disturbance environment. In particular, at the heating rates encountered during hypersonic re-entry, surface ablation products blowing into the boundary layer introduce new interactions, for example chemical reactions and radiation absorption, that strongly affect surface heating rates and integrated heat loads. Aerothermal analyses and management are also relevant to the design of advanced propulsion systems. A better fundamental understanding coupled with the ability to accurately simulate the aerothermodynamics of highly loaded turbomachinery is needed, along with innovative ideas such as flow control for increasing fan and compressor work factors without sacrificing efficiency and operability. Improvements in turbine cooling effectiveness, secondary flow management, and component matching are also important for high-pressure ratio engines. Proposals suggesting innovative approaches to any of these issues are of interest.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics ,"A2.09Aircraft Systems Analysis, Design and Optimization", ARC," ARC, LaRC","One of the approaches to achieve the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Program goals is to solve the aeronautics challenges for a broad range of air vehicles with system-level optimization, assessment and technology integration. The needs to meet this approach can be defined by four general themes: Design Environment Development; Variable Fidelity, Physics-Based Design/Analysis Tools; Technology Assessment and Integration; and Evaluation of Advanced Concepts.Current interdisciplinary design/analysis involves a multitude of tools not necessarily developed to work together, hindering their application to complete system design/analysis studies. Multi-fidelity, multi-disciplinary optimization frameworks, such as Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS), have been developed by NASA but have limited capabilities to simulate complete vehicle systems. Solicited topics are aligned with these four themes that will support this NASA research area. (1) Design Environment Development Technology development is needed to provide complex simulation and modeling capabilities where the computer science details are transparent to the engineer. A framework environment is needed to provide a seamless integration environment where the engineer need not be concerned with where or how particular codes within the system level simulation will be run. Interfaces and utilities to define, setup, verify, determine the appropriate resources, and launch the system simulation are also needed. Research challenges include the engineering details needed to numerically zoom (i.e., numerical analysis at various levels of detail) between multi-fidelity components of the same discipline, as well as, multi-discipline components of the same fidelity. A major computer science challenge is developing boundary objects that will be reused in a wide variety of simulations. Proposals will be considered that enable coupling differing disciplines, numerical zooming within a single discipline, deploying large simulations, and assembling and controlling secure or non-secure simulations. (2) Variable Fidelity, Physics-Based Design/Analysis Tools An integrated design process combines high-fidelity computational analyses from several disciplines with advanced numerical design procedures to simultaneously perform detailed Outer Mold Line (OML) shape optimization, structural sizing, active load alleviation control, multi-speed performance (e.g., low takeoff and landing speeds, but efficient transonic cruise), and/or other detailed-design tasks. Current practice still widely uses sequential, single-discipline optimization, at best coupling low-fidelity modeling of other relevant disciplines during the detailed design phase. Substantial performance improvements will be realized by developing closely integrated design procedures coupled with highest-fidelity analyses for use during detailed-design. Design procedures must enable rapid determination of sensitivities (gradients) of a design objective with respect to all design variables and constraints, choose search directions through design space without violating constraints, and make appropriate changes to the vehicle shape (ideally both external OML shape and internal structural element size). Solicitations are for integrated design optimization tools that find combinations of design variables from more than one discipline and can vary synergistically to produce superior performance compared to the results of sequential, single-discipline optimization or repeated cut-and-try analysis. (3) Technology Assessment and Integration Improved analysis capability of integrated airframe and propulsion systems would allow more efficient designs to be created that would maximize efficiency and performance while minimizing both noise and emissions. Improved integrated system modeling should allow designers to consider trade offs between various design and operating parameters to determine the optimum design for various classes of subsonic fixed wing aircraft ranging from personal aircraft to large transports. The modeling would also be beneficial if it had enough fidelity to enable it to analyze both conventional and unconventional systems. Current analysis tools capable of analyzing integrated systems are based on simplified physical and semi-empirical models that are not fully capable of analyzing aircraft and propulsion system parameters that would be required for new or unconventional systems. Analyses tools are solicited that are capable of analyzing new and unconventional aircraft and propulsion integrated systems. These include: (1) New combustor designs, alternate fuel operation, and the ability to estimate all emissions, and (2) Noise source models (e.g., fan, jet, turbine, core and airframe components). Analyses tools that are scalable, especially to small aircraft, are desired. (4) Evaluation of Advanced Concepts Conceptual design and analysis of unconventional vehicle concepts and technologies is needed for technology portfolio investment planning, development of advanced concepts to provide technology pull, and independent technical assessment of new concepts. This capability will enable ""virtual expeditions through the design space"" for multi-mission trade studies and optimization. This will require an integrated variable fidelity concept design system. The aerospace flight vehicle conceptual design phase is, in contrast to the succeeding preliminary and detail design phases, the most important step in the product development sequence, because of its predefining function. However, the conceptual design phase is the least well understood part of the entire flight vehicle design process, owing to its high level of abstraction and associated risk, its multidisciplinary design complexity, its permanent shortage of available design information, and its chronic time pressure to find solutions. Currently, the important primary aerospace vehicle design decisions at the conceptual design level (e.g., overall configuration selection) are still made using extremely simple analyses and heuristics. An integrated, variable fidelity system would have large benefits. Higher fidelity tools enabling unconventional configurations to be addressed in the conceptual design process are solicited.Read less>>"

Flight test vehicles operate over a wide range of environmental conditions including among others: variable ambient pressure (the result of altitude changes), variable temperature (the result of altitude and airspeed changes), and vibration and acceleration (the result of engine vibration and dynamic flight maneuvers). In addition, weight, volume, and power requirements are at a premium because of limited space, power, and weight carrying capacity. The first emphasis for this subtopic is in the area of flight test techniques. Factors in flight test techniques include, but are not limited to: methods for achieving accurate and repeatable flight test conditions (e.g., altitude, airspeed, flow quality, or turbulence intensity). Reconfigurable systems, alternative power sources, and novel methods for onboard data processing, storage, real-time access and RF data transmission are of interest. Technologies are also being requested to aid in multi-aircraft co-operative test techniques to enable chase aircraft to probe flow fields and visualize shock patterns around target aircraft. The second emphasis for this subtopic is in the area of flight test measurement technology. Examples of the types of technology solutions sought are: data acquisition system improvements and miniaturization, skin friction experimental measurement techniques, and improved flow transition measurement techniques. Special emphasis is placed on new or novel, non-intrusive measurement technologies for pressure, temperature, and force measurements, and force measurement (balance) technology. Also, techniques that could facilitate shortening test measurement installation and setup times would be of interest such as methodologies that minimize the wiring infrastructure and other aircraft installation requirements would be applicable. Another area of interest is in test data conversions to different domains or data compression to reduce the volume of information that must be transmitted over existing telemetry links. It should be understood that all of these technologies must be capable of operating under extremes of temperature, pressure, and vibration typical in the flight environment. Proposals that lead to products or processes that are applicable specifically to the ATP facilities and across multiple flight test-beds are especially important. Test-beds can be broadly categorized throughout a range of flight regimes encompassing hypersonic (e.g., orbital, sub-orbital, Phoenix missile), supersonic (e.g., F-15, F-16, F-18), and subsonic Fixed-Wing aircraft (e.g., ER2, G3, Predator-B). All platforms have a variety of different Mach/Altitude flight envelopes. Read less>>"

Science,Topic S3 Spacecraft and Platform SubSystems ,S3.04Propulsion Systems, GRC," JPL, JSC, MSFC","The Science Mission Directorate (SMD) needs spacecraft with ever-increasing propulsive performance and flexibility for ambitious missions requiring high duty cycles and years of operation. Planetary spacecraft need the ability to rendezvous with, orbit, and conduct in situ exploration of planets, satellites and other solar system bodies. Platforms, satellites, and satellite constellations have high-precision propulsion requirements, usually in volume- and power-limited envelopes.

Science,Topic S3 Spacecraft and Platform SubSystems ,S3.05Terrestrial Balloon Technology, GSFC, JPL,"The Balloon Program Office (BPO) is soliciting innovations in two specific areas: (1) Currently, the Balloon Program Office is developing an Ultra Long Duration Balloon (ULDB) vehicle targeting 100 day duration missions in mid-latitude. This added capability will greatly enable new science investigations. The design of the current pumpkin shape vehicle utilizes light weight polyethylene film and high strength tendons made of twisted Zylon® yarn. The in-flight performance and health of the vehicle relies on accurate information on a number of environmental and design parameters. Therefore, NASA is seeking innovations in the following specific areas: Tendons are the load carrying member in the pumpkin design. During a typical mission, loading on individual tendons should not exceed a critical design limit to insure structural integrity and survival. A key technology challenge is the development of devices or methods to accurately and continuously measure individual axial loading on an array of up to 200 separate tendons during a ULDB mission. Tendons are typically captured at the fitting via individual pins. Loading levels on the tendons can range from ~20 N to ~8,000 N and temperature can vary from room temperature to the troposphere temperatures of -90ºC or colder. The devices of interest shall be easily integrated with the tendons or fittings during balloon fabrication and shall have minimal impact on the overall mass of the balloon system. Ambient air, helium gas, and balloon film temperature measurements are needed to accurately model the balloon performance during a typical flight at altitudes of approximately 120,000 feet. The measurement must compensate for the effects of direct solar radiation through shielding or calculation. Minimal mass and volume are highly desired. For film measurement, a non-invasive and non-contact approach is highly desired for the thin polyethylene film, with film thickness ranging from 0.8 to 1.5 mils, used as the balloon envelope. (2) The Balloon Program Office is also seeking innovations to reduce the effects of parachute opening shock on gondolas and balloon subsystems. This shock is produced by the rapid opening of a flight system's parachute after the payload is released from the balloon at mission termination. Innovations may address the problem either by reducing the termination shock via modifications to the recovery system or by attenuating the shock produced by current recovery systems. Proposed technologies will be evaluated for their mass efficiency, ease of integration, effectiveness at reducing shock levels, compatibility with balloon flight environments, and cost effectiveness, among other factors. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward a Phase 2 hardware/software demonstration, and when possible, deliver a demonstration unit for functional and environmental testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract.

Venus features a dense, CO2 atmosphere completely covered by sulfuric acid clouds at about 55 km above the surface, a surface temperature of about 486ºC and a surface pressure of about 90 atmospheres. Although already explored by various orbiters and short-lived atmospheric probes and landers, Venus retains many secrets pertaining to its formation and evolution. NASA is interested in expanding its ability to explore the deep atmosphere and surface of Venus through the use of long-lived (days or weeks) balloons and landers. Survivability in extreme high temperatures and high pressures is also required for deep atmospheric probes to giant planets. Technology advancements to permit operation and survivability in high-temperature/high-pressure planetary environments are sought in the following areas: Thermal Control Systems: Survivability of electronic components in high temperature environments relies on three basic areas of thermal control: isolation, thermal capacitance and/or refrigeration. Specific improvements in are sought in the development of: Thermal energy storage systems with 300 - 1000 kJ/kg energy density through either phase changes or chemical heat absorption; High performance, low mass refrigeration cooling systems capable of pumping on the order of 100 Watts of heat from a 100ºC source to the Venus sink temperature of 486ºC.

Appropriate sensing technologies for this topic should provide measurements of physical forces or properties that support some aspect of EDL operations.

Science,Topic S5 Robotic Exploration Technologies ,"S5.03Sample Collection, Processing, and Handling Devices", JPL," ARC, GSFC","Robust systems for sample acquisition from the subsurface of planetary bodies are critical to the next generation of robotic explorers. Limited spacecraft resources (power, volume, mass, computational capabilities, and telemetry bandwidth) demand innovative, integrated sampling systems that can survive and operate in challenging environments (extremes in temperature, pressure, gravity, vibration and thermal cycling). Research should be conducted to develop compact, low-power, lightweight subsurface sampling systems with access to depths of 1 - 3 m below the surface. A relevant mission scenario for this type of drill would include drilling multiple holes from a mobile platform, such as a rover. For reference, current Mars-relevant rovers range in mass from 200 - 800 kg. Also of interest are integrated systems for 1-10 cm subsurface sampling. Consideration should be given to potential failure scenarios for integrated systems. For example, recovery and mitigation techniques for platform slip and borehole misalignment should be addressed. Significant attention should be given to the sensing and automation required for real-time control, fault diagnosis and recovery. Additional areas of interest include understanding the limitations of dry drilling into mixed media such as icy mixtures of rock and regolith and hot subsurface materials at high pressure (up to 740 K in a 90 bar CO2 environment). Sample manipulation technologies are needed to enable handling and transfer of unstructured samples from a sampling device to instruments and sample processing systems. Shallow rock core and regolith samples may be variable in size and composition so a sample manipulation system needs to be flexible enough to handle the sample variability. Core samples will be on the order of 1 cm diameter and up to 10 cm long. Soil and rock fragment samples will be of similar volumes. Actual samples to be analyzed in instruments will likely be small subsamples so the means for subsampling and manipulation of the original sample and subsamples needs to be developed. Minimal size and mass components and systems have the greatest benefit. Also of particular need are means of acquiring subsurface rock and regolith samples with minimum contamination. This contamination may include contaminants brought to the sample by the drill itself, material from one stratigraphic layer contaminating samples collected at another depth (sample cross-contamination), or Earth-source microorganisms brought to the Martian surface prior to drilling ('clean' sampling from a 'dirty' surface).Read less>>"
Science,Topic S5 Robotic Exploration Technologies ,S5.04Surface and Subsurface Robotic Exploration, JPL," ARC, GSFC","Technologies are needed to enable access to surface and subsurface sampling sites of scientific interest on Mars. Mobility technology is needed to enable access to difficult-to-reach sites such as access through steep terrain. Many scientifically valuable sites are accessible only via terrain that is too steep for state-of-the-art planetary rovers to traverse. Sites include crater walls, canyons, and gullies. Tethered systems, non-wheeled systems, and marsupial systems are examples of mobility technologies that are of interest. Tether technology could enable new approaches for deployment, retrieval and mobility. Innovative marsupial systems could allow a pair of vehicles with different mobility characteristics to collaborate to enable access to challenging terrain. It is envisioned that a 500-800 kg primary vehicle could provide long traverse to the vicinity of a challenging site and then deploy a smaller 20-50 kg vehicle with steep mobility access capability for access to the site. Technologies to enable subsurface access and sampling in multiple holes at least 1 - 3 meters deep through rock, regolith or ice compositions are also sought. Subsurface access solutions to be integrated onto 500-800 kg stationary landers and mobile platforms are of interest. Consideration should be given for potential failure scenarios, such as platform slip and borehole misalignment for integrated systems, and the challenges of dry drilling into mixed media including icy mixtures of rock and regolith. Systems should ensure minimal contamination of samples from Earth-source contaminants and cross-contamination from samples at different depths. Innovative low-mass, low-power, and modular systems and subsystems are of particular interest.

Balloons and airships will carry scientific payloads on Mars, Venus, Titan, and the outer planets in order to investigate their atmospheres in situ and their surfaces from close proximity. Their envelopes will be subject to extreme environments and must support missions with a range of durations. Proposals are sought in the following areas: Aerial Deployment Modeling Tool Many aerobot concepts for Mars, Titan, and Venus involve the aerial deployment and inflation of the balloon during parachute descent after arrival at the destination. Proposals are sought that would provide computer modeling tools that can simulate this complex process. Of particular importance is the ability to model the balloon shape and material stresses as a function of time, taking into account the aerodynamic forces generated by the parachute and by the uninflated or partially inflated balloon, as well as transient loads during balloon deployment from its storage container. The balloons can be either polymer film or polymer film plus reinforcing fabric laminates. Metal Bellows for High Temperature Venus Balloons Cylindrically-shaped metal bellows are a potential solution to the problem of making balloons that can tolerate the 460°C temperatures near the surface of Venus. Commercial off-the-shelf metal bellows are limited in diameter to approximately 0.4 m. NASA seeks proposals for metal bellows technology that can produce prototypes in the range of 1 - 2 m in diameter and 5 - 10 m long; tolerant of sulfuric acid; good fatigue properties at 460°C; and areal densities of up to 1 kg/m2. High Strength Envelope Materials for Titan Aerobots NASA currently has viable cryogenic balloon materials based on polyester film plus fabric laminates. It is desired to have new, advanced materials that possess at least a 50% improvement in the strength to weight ratio while retaining comparable flexibility to the current polyester materials. The desired areal densities are in the range of 40-80 g/m2 so as to support both superpressure and zero pressure balloon concepts. Of particular interest is the use of existing high strength fiber materials like Vectran, Spectra, Dyneema, PBO and Twaron/Kevlar to achieve the desired performance.

Specific objectives are to: Reduce the learning curve for using supercomputing resources; Minimize total time-to-solution (i.e., time to discovery, understanding, or prediction); Increase the scale and complexity of computational analysis and data assimilation; Accelerate advancement of system models and designs.The approach of this subtopic is to develop intuitive, high-level tools, interfaces, and environments for users, and to infuse them into NASA supercomputing operations. Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into either of the NASA high-end computing projects, including the High End Computing Columbia (HECC) project at Ames and the NASA Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS) at Goddard. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward a Phase 2 prototype demonstration. Open Source software and open standards are strongly preferred. Specific areas of interest include: Application Development With the increasing scale and complexity of supercomputers, users must often expend a tremendous effort to translate their physical system model or algorithm into a correct and efficient supercomputer application code. This subtopic element seeks intuitive, high-level application development environments, ideally leveraging high-level programming languages (e.g., parallel Matlab or IDL) to enable rapid supercomputer application development, even for novice users. This environment should dramatically simplify application development activities such as porting, parallelization, debugging, scaling, performance analysis, and optimization. Results V&V A primary barrier to effective use of supercomputing by novices is understanding the accuracy of their computational results. Errors in the input data, domain definition, grids, algorithms, and application code can individually or in combination produce non-physical results that a user may not detect. This subtopic element seeks tools and environments to help users with verification and validation (V&V) of simulation results. This could be accomplished by enabling comparison of results from similar applications or with known accurate results, access to results analysis tools and domain experts, or access to error estimation tools and training. Data Analysis and Visualization Supercomputing computations almost invariably result in tremendous amounts of data, measuring in the gigabytes or terabytes, and with many dimensions and other complexity aspects. This subtopic element seeks user-friendly tools and environments for analysis and visualization of large-scale, complex data sets typically resulting from supercomputing computations.

Science,Topic S6 Information Technologies ,S6.03On-Board Data Processing and Control, ARC, GSFC,"Technology advances allow scientists to build devices that often collect more data than can be cost effectively transmitted or summarized within mission time constraints. NASA is developing sensor web capabilities which can require these data be analyzed for rapid decision making, either autonomously or with human in the loop controller. This subtopic enables sensor web capabilities and increases mission data return by developing on-board methods that can operate with very limited resources to increase the efficiency and scientific return of existing and future sensors. Approaches range form losses less data compression prior to transmission to some degree of ""data understanding"" that enables data management and prioritization based on potential science content. These software capabilities will enable sensor webs that operate semi-autonomously and are capable of reacting to what is being sensed and triggering notifications or additional actions. Algorithms can be embedded into an instrument or device or algorithms can target on-board computer resources for data management and /or transmission as part of the post collection data flow. The selection of on-board methods to increase scientific return is highly dependent on mission objectives. Successful candidate technologies will need to demonstrate suitability to the general requirements of the proposed use scenario as they pertain to different instrument (or device) types. Generally, scientists do not want to throw away data given that significant discoveries have been made reinterpretation archived data. Methods that reduce information content such as lossy compression are often not desirable unless significant, new capabilities are enabled by this tradeoff. Examples exist where instruments are turned off and on and instances when sensor or camera data is saved and transmitted only when features are detected by on-board software. These instances occur when transmission costs, relative to available resources, are high. E.g., a Mars Exploration Rover was reprogrammed to detect and transmit camera images containing dust devils. Algorithms can be designed to run on general purpose computing resources or specialized i.e., field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). Novel approaches that can leverage specialized, space qualified computing resources such as FPGAs that return order of magnitude reduction in data volume or screening capabilities are desirable. There is a trade-off between sensor volume and complexity against distance and degree of on-board autonomy needed for mission success so performance metrics are relative to the science mission scenario. Example sensor types include data intensive instruments such as hyperspectral, RADAR, and LIDAR but can include any sensor technology that is shown relevant to the board scope of science within the NASA science mission directorate. For instance, aggressive metrics for compression and data volume are in Earth science the Decadal survey has the following requirements on data compression: RADAR Missions SMAP (RADAR) DESDynI (RADAR) SWOT (RADAR) OBP Input data rate (MHz) 32 400 500 Processor Throughput (GFLOPS) 7 20 90 Data Compression Ratio80:1 10:1 90:1 Where raw data sample spacing is 0.75 m x 1.5 m (16 bits per sample), and the output data sample spacing is 10 m x 10 m (16 bits per sample).

Constellation systems that would benefit from automation and autonomy include crewed vehicle systems, surface robots, habitats, and infrastructure (in situ resource utilization, power systems, etc.). Needed capabilities range from decision support systems in Mission Control to autonomous robotic operations for the Moon and Mars. These capabilities will be instrumental for decreasing workload, reducing dependence on Earth-based support staff, enhancing response time, and releasing crew and operators from routine tasks to focus on those requiring human judgment. In addition, significant reductions in Mission Risk can be achieved through the use of automated checking and enforcing of flight rules and constraints. The NASA Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP) has been developing a set of core autonomy capabilities that can adjust the level of human interaction from fully supervised to fully autonomous. To further the application of adjustable automation and autonomy, development is needed in three broad areas:Execution tools; Decision support systems; Trustable systems. Execution Tools Executives are a key autonomy capability. However, support tools are needed to facilitate the authoring and validation of execution scripts. Tools that are not tied specifically to one executive would provide NASA the most flexibility in applying such tools across projects. Examples of needed capabilities include:Graphical tool for monitoring and debugging plan execution; Graphical tool for creating and editing execution scripts; Tools for authoring and validating execution plans; User friendly abstraction of low-level execution languages by adding syntactic enhancements. Decision Support Systems Decision support systems amplify the efficiency of operators by providing the information they need when and where they need it. As the complexity of the constellation system increases, so must the capabilities of decision support systems. Decision support tools are needed that:Command and supervise complex tasks while projecting the outcome of actions and identify potential problems; Understand system state, including visualization and summarization; Allow the system to interact with a user when generating the plan and allow evaluation of alternate courses of action; Integration of a planning and scheduling system as part of an on-board, closed loop controller; Scale up existing techniques to larger problem applications. Trustable Systems Systems that support or interact with crew require a very high level of reliability. Tools are needed that improve the reliability and trustworthiness of autonomous systems. These include:Ability to predict what the system will do; Guarantees of behavioral properties; Other properties that increase the operator's trust; Verifiability (e.g., restricted executive languages that facilitate model-based verification).To enable the application of intelligent automation and autonomy techniques, the technologies need to address two significant challenges: configuration management and software validation. Reusable automation software must be adaptable to new applications without undue difficulty, and easily adjusted as the application operations change. The overhead of applying automation techniques to new applications is one of the two key obstacles to acceptance of such techniques in operations. A variation of the same issue is that of adjustment as requirements and application contexts change, which is inevitable in spacecraft operations. The software and the adaptation to a given application must also be trusted before it can be accepted. Testing and other techniques are keys to establishing such trust and ensuring the correct function of automation systems. However, in both testing and validation, the complexity of intelligent software has proven to be a major obstacle. This has led to trust and correctness issues being another key obstacle to adoption of intelligent automation systems in both unmanned, and most importantly, in crewed vehicles. Proposals in this area should address the definition of autonomy and automation software architectures that facilitate adaptation and ensure correctness. Read less>>"

For example, the Moon's equatorial regions experience temperature swings from -180°C to +130°C during the lunar day/night cycle, and the sustained temperature at the shadowed regions of lunar poles can be as low as -230°C. Likewise, the diurnal temperature on Mars spans from about -120°C to +20°C. While many types of devices can operate down to very low temperatures (e.g., SiGE HBT's), there are significant circuit design challenges that need to be addressed. Thermal cycling present in lunar and Martian environments introduces reliability concerns associated with mechanical stress and fatigue of components and integrated circuits. For example, thermal cycling may result in mechanical or packaging related fractures. The selection of appropriate materials is therefore critical to developing suitable electronic products. In addition, electronic systems and/or components must be radiation tolerant, operating reliably after receiving a total ionizing dose (TID) greater than but not equal to 50 krads (Si) and providing single-event latchup immunity (SEL) greater than but not equal to 100 MeV cm2/mg. Proposals are sought in the following specific areas:Wide temperature (-180°C to +130°C) and low-temperature (-230°C), radiation-tolerant, low-power circuits including analog-to-digital converters, digital-to-analog converters, low-noise pre-amplifiers, voltage and current references, multiplexers, power switches, microcontrollers, and integrated command, control, and drive electronics for sensors, actuators, and communications transponders. Packaging capable of surviving numerous thermal cycles and tolerant of the extreme temperatures on the Moon and Mars. This includes the use of appropriate materials including substrates, die-attach, encapsulants, thermal compounds, etc. Tightly-integrated electronic sensor and actuator modules that include power, command and control, and processing. Such modules should be capable of operating at the lunar and/or Martian temperature extremes. Radiation-tolerant, SEL immune, wide temperature (-180°C to +130°C), and low-temperature (-230°C) RF electronics for short-range and long-range communication systems. Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools for predicting the electrical performance, reliability, and life cycle for low-temperature and wide-temperature electronic systems and components. Physics-based device models valid at temperature ranging from -230°C to +130°C to enable design, verification and fabrication of custom mixed-signal and analog circuits. Circuit design and layout methodologies/techniques that facilitate improved low-temperature (-230°C) analog and mixed-signal circuit performance. Radiation-tolerant processors with significantly improved throughput and processing efficiencies. Chip-level (not board-level) technologies optimized for numerically intensive algorithms and applications with the following minimum performance metrics are sought: Sustained throughput - 2 GMACS (16-bit operations); Power efficiency - 1 GMACS/W (16-bit operations); Total ionizing dose - 100 krads; Single event upset rate - 10-10 errors / bit-day; Single event latchup - greater than 75 MeV/cm2/mg; Operational temperature range - -55°C to +125°C.Proposals should demonstrate a working knowledge of temperature concerns, whether they be mechanical (material transition points, thermal stress, fatigue, fracture, etc.) or electrical (carrier freezeout, base-emitter injection efficiency, leakage, threshold voltage dependency, Johnson noise, charge trapping, kink effect, etc.). Research should be conducted in two phases. During Phase 1, research should demonstrate the technical feasibility and show a path towards a hardware/software demonstration. During Phase 2, emphasis should be placed on developing and demonstrating the technology under relevant test conditions. Additionally, a path should be outlined that shows how the technology could be commercialized or further developed into space-worthy systems. When applicable, researchers should deliver a demonstration unit for functional and environmental testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract. Read less>>"
Exploration Systems,Topic X1 Avionics and Software ,X1.04Integrated System Health Management, ARC," JPL, KSC, MSFC","Innovative health management technologies are needed throughout NASA's Constellation architecture in order to increase the safety and mission-effectiveness of future spacecraft and launch vehicles. In human space flight, a significant concern for NASA is the safety of ground and flight crews under off-nominal or failure conditions. The new Ares Crew Launch Vehicle will provide the means to abort the crew using a launch abort system. In case of a catastrophic failure during launch or ascent, the decision to abort the crew needs to be made within a very brief timeframe and with high certainty: either false positive or false negative crew abort indications carry a large safety and cost burden. Furthermore, the Constellation architecture allows for fully-automated crew abort under certain circumstances, increasing the accuracy and sensitivity requirements on the system health management function for the Ares launch vehicle and the Orion crew capsule. There are other health and status requirements beyond launch and ascent. Traditional means of verifying space system health and status, such as caution and warning systems that are triggered by off-nominal sensor values are rather limited in their utility. In addition to issues such as sensor failures and false alarms, redline-triggered caution and warning events are difficult to interpret, often requiring involvement of large numbers of mission support staff to isolate a failure and initiate a recovery procedure. Health and status methods that depend on support from the ground are likely to become a safety liability as communication delays or bottlenecks increase (e.g., lunar trips). Under these circumstances, autonomous and automated solutions to systems health management provide the best means of increasing crew safety and mission success probability for future space exploration missions. For deployment on human missions, health management systems must be treated as Class A human-rated systems as defined by NASA procedural requirements (NPR 7150.2) and must undergo formal verification and validation. Future ground operations will require quick and efficient turnaround and processing of spacecraft for launch. In addition, new operations concepts must be developed to provide a high level of safety and mission assurance while reducing ground processing and mission support staff. New methods driven by health management innovation may be used to curtail system lifecycle costs through more cost-effective inspection and certification of flight systems, as well as more cost-effective management of ground and mission operations. Proposals should be responsive to the overall goals and objectives of NASA's Constellation and Lunar Precursors and Robotics Programs. Proposals may address specific vehicle health management capabilities required for exploration system elements (crewed spacecraft, launch systems, habitats, rovers, etc.). In addition, projects may focus on one or more relevant subsystems such as solid rocket motors, liquid propulsion systems, structures and mechanisms, thermal protection systems, power, avionics, life support, and communications. Proposals that involve the use of existing testbeds or facilities at one of the participating NASA centers (ARC, MSFC, KSC, or JPL) for technology validation and maturation are strongly encouraged. Specific technical areas of interest related to integrated systems health management include the following:Methods and tools to enable early-stage design of health management functionality during the development of space systems. These methods and tools should provide a means to optimize health management system design at the functional level to decide on failure detection methods, sensor types and locations, and identify additional functionality to safeguard against failures before costly design decisions have been made. Innovative methods for sensor validation and robust state estimation in the presence of inherently unreliable sensors. Proposals should focus on data analysis and interpretation using legacy sensors rather than development of new sensors or sensor systems. Model-based methods for fault detection and isolation in rocket propulsion systems based on existing sensor suites during pre-launch propellant loading and during mission operations. Concepts for advanced built-in-tests for spacecraft avionics that reduce or eliminate the need for extensive functional verification and to predict remaining life of avionics systems based on usage history. Methods for robust control of critical components, subsystems, and systems and robust execution of critical sequences during launch operations or flight. Of special interest are robust recovery methods and innovative approaches to functional redundancy for the purpose of enhancing safety, availability, and maintainability. Prognostic techniques able to anticipate system degradation and enable further improvements in mission success probability, operational effectiveness, and automated recovery of function. Proposals in this area should focus on systems and components commonly found in spacecraft. Innovative human-system integration methods that can convey a wealth of health and status information to flight crews, ground and mission support staff quickly and effectively, especially under off-nominal and emergency conditions. Verification and validation techniques for advanced fault detection and prognostic capabilities leading to certification for use in human rated critical systems in a cost-effective manner.

Uncrewed spacecraft must perform automated and/or autonomous rendezvous, proximity operations and docking operations (commonly known as Automated Rendezvous and Docking, AR&D). The crewed versions may also perform AR&D, possibly with a different level of automation and/or autonomy, and must also provide the crew with reliable, fault tolerant relative navigation information for manual piloting. The capabilities of the RPOD sensors are critical to the success of the Exploration Program. The relatively low technology readiness of existing relative navigation sensors for AR&D has been carried as one of the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) Project's top risks. This subtopic seeks innovative technologies that can provide relative navigation capabilities for rendezvous, proximity operations and docking of two spacecraft. Long-range rendezvous sensors should provide bearing from beyond 200 km to 5 km distance between spacecraft, but range and range-rate are also desirable. Proximity operations sensors should provide range, range-rate, and bearing from approximately 5 km to 100 m. Docking sensors should provide relative position and relative attitude from approximately 100 m to docking; relative attitude may only be needed from 30 m in to docking but longer ranges are desirable. Ideal solutions would combine multiple relative navigation sensing capabilities into a single system in order to reduce mass, volume, and power. Solutions should be designed to operate in Low Earth Orbit, Low Lunar Orbit, or both. Solutions can include a relative navigation sensor ""suite"" that consists of multiple sensor types but covers the full range; the sensor suite should allow RPOD under any lighting conditions. Solutions should also include a robust and fault tolerant capability that is suitable for a human-rated space vehicle. In addition, the relative navigation technologies should be designed so that existing infrastructure on the International Space Station (reflectors, communications systems, etc.) does not interfere with the relative navigation capability of the maneuvering vehicle. Some specific technology focus areas of interest include: (1) use of relative navigation sensors that do not require special retro-reflectors or targets on the target spacecraft but can make use of natural features or existing infrastructure; this focus area may make use of Light-Imaging Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) components in order to get range and range-rate to the objects in the field of view, or may use video-based technology; (2) fault tolerant sensor systems; and (3) other technology areas for long-range rendezvous sensors that may include star trackers, infrared sensors, and radio frequency-based sensors; these types of sensors may have an extended range well beyond 200 km.

Vehicles and habitats are expected to be significantly restricted with respect to habitable volume and may operate at reduced atmospheric pressure with elevated oxygen concentrations. Improved non-regenerative and regenerative processes technologies for atmospheric quality control must be developed. The ability to economically supply atmospheric gases and refill storage tanks in flight will be needed. Isolating habitable volumes from surface dust and disposing of accumulated particulate matter will be challenges. Systems must be innovative and extremely efficient with respect to volume, mass, energy and thermal requirements. Atmospheric Resource Management Atmospheric resource management encompasses process technologies and equipment to supply, store, and condition atmospheric gases; provide gaseous oxygen at pressures at or above 3,000 psia; and achieve mass closure by recycling resources and using in situ resources. Typical process technologies employed for achieving these needs may include reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon, sub-critical gas storage, and electrolytic oxygen production with compression. Techniques for enhancing NASA's present capabilities and filling technology gaps are sought. The ability to provide early computer-based process technology predictive performance models for application scale-up and scale-down is desirable. Areas of emphasis include:Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reduction for Recovery of Oxygen: Process technologies for removing and sequestering carbon dioxide from cabin atmospheric gases (via means other than adsorption or chemisorption) and conditioning carbon dioxide for use in reduction processes to facilitate cabin mass balance closure are sought. Technologies to reduce carbon dioxide to a carbon product with high efficiency that yields a high percentage mass balance closure are also of interest. Gas Supply and Storage: Novel means for supplying and storing oxygen and nitrogen under sub-critical conditions that lead to enhancements in energy efficiency, reduced mass and volume, and mission flexibility are sought. Further, process technologies leading to a ready, in-flight renewable source of 3,000-psia gaseous oxygen are of interest. Particulate Matter Removal and Disposal Dust and particulate matter contamination are challenges that must be overcome for lunar surface exploration. Particulate contamination originating from the external surface environment or from internal sources are both of concern. Development of process technologies and equipment to minimize the impacts of surface dust on crew health and equipment inside the habitable volume are sought, including novel approaches to remove dust from spacecraft cabin atmosphere and isolate habitable volumes from surface dust. Candidate technology solutions should provide high efficiency and long-lived removal capacity. Technologies must be tolerant to the abrasive effects of dust particles. Performance should be demonstrated with appropriate lunar dust analogs or simulants.

These techniques must be able to separate and dispose of lunar dust to the lunar surface, and/or dispose of and collect all other particulate matter to highly compacted units/states. Salient features for this application include capability for regeneration in place, long-lived and large bulk removal capacity, and high efficiency. Operational modes of continuous regeneration or long interval regeneration cycles using either single or multi-stage regeneration processes will be considered. Methods for determining and annunciating the loading and unloading status of the regenerative unit and for automated regeneration are of interest.

Significant improvements are sought in miniaturization, accuracy, precision, and operational reliability, as well as long life, real-time multiple measurement functions, in-line operation, self-calibration, reduction of expendables, low energy consumption, and minimal operator time/maintenance for monitoring and controlling the life-support processes. Proposals should be for either new technologies or combine existing technologies in a new way to simultaneously monitor several major constituents and dust, and/or trace constituents. Substances from an external environment such as lunar surface dust may be encountered during astronaut excursions and may be a mechanical or chemical threat both during the external encounter and if brought inside. Monitoring technologies are needed to assess and quantify these threats. For longer missions, water monitoring will be required. Needs will include sensitive, fast response, online analytical sensors to monitor suspended liquid droplets, dispersed gas bubbles, and water quality, particularly total organic carbon.

Exploration Systems,Topic X5 Lunar In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) ,X5.01Oxygen Production from Lunar Regolith, JSC," GRC, KSC, MSFC","Oxygen production from lunar regolith processing consists of receiving regolith from the excavation subsystem into a hopper, transferring that regolith into a reactor where it is reduced using chemical or an electrochemical process, potentially intermediate reactions to reach oxygen, purification of the oxygen, and transfer of the oxygen to the liquefaction and storage subsystem. After oxygen has been extracted from the regolith, the spent regolith must be removed from the reactor and returned to the excavation subsystem for disposal. Depending on the process used, the reactor may contain reduced metals that can be extracted in their pure form for use as a manufacturing feedstock. To maximize the benefits of In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) for the Lunar Exploration Architecture, oxygen production systems must minimize the mass and power consumption of ISRU systems. ISRU systems must be able to produce many times their own mass in oxygen and other products to provide a benefit to the architecture. ISRU systems must be able to autonomously operate in a harsh environment that has wide temperature swings, high radiation and abrasive dust. Depending on the outpost location, the systems must be able to sustain many startup and shutdown sequences when solar power is not available. Some of these shutdown periods may exceed several hundred hours. The next phase of ISRU research and development will focus on the design and testing of a regolith reduction system that can produce roughly 1000 kilograms of oxygen in a year. The operation assumption is that the production plant will operate off of solar power which is estimated to be available about 70% of the time and will operate at a lunar pole with highlands soils. The current oxygen production approaches being developed into prototypes are: Hydrogen Reduction, Carbothermal and Molten Oxide Electrolysis. The basic description of these approaches can be found in the NASA funded report by Eagle Engineering, entitled ""Conceptual Design of a Lunar Oxygen Pilot Plant (1988)"". The report can be found on the web at http://www.isruinfo.com/index.php(link is external).NASA is seeking subsystem component technologies rather than full system proposals. We would like to encourage the development of subsystem components that could be inserted into our Exploration Technology Development Program funded oxygen production systems to improve the mass, power and efficiency of the system. Technology areas of particular interest are: Heat exchangers to recover energy from heated regolith; Low/No maintenance system filtration technologies for removing dust from gas lines; Water condensers that would use the cooling potential of the space environment to water condensation with minimal energy usage; Solar Concentrators that are lightweight and able to deliver concentrated solar thermal energy to reactors generating regolith temperatures from 900°C up to 1600°C; Gas Separators that provide low pressure drop separation of the system and product gas streams from impurities (e.g., H2S, SO2); Microchannel methanation reactors that convert a mixture of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen to methane and water vapor with carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide consumed to the maximum extent possible; O2 Purification technologies that perform the removal (and reclamation) of all contaminants prior to liquefaction of the oxygen; Feed systems to introduce regolith to the reactors and remove the regolith, slag or molten products from the reactor post processing. The systems must minimize the possibility of dust contaminating the reactor seals; Reactor Seals: The sealing of reactors includes sealing gas interfaces from the reactor to the remainder of the system and also the regolith feed/exit to the reactor. Valves proposed for use for gas interfaces must be capable of 1000s of operations and able to operate when lunar dust is present in the gas stream. Reactor regolith feed/exit seals proposed for use must either be kept clean, can be automatically cleaned, or seal even with a coating of lunar dust.

Technology advances that will reduce the weight and volume, improve the efficiency, life, safety, system simplicity and reliability of RFC systems are desired. The specific advancements of interest are outlined below. Regenerative Fuel Cell (RFC) Systems: Primary fuel cells and water electrolyzers are the two major constituent subsystems of RFC systems. Of these two subsystems, water electrolyzers are at a lower level of technology readiness than primary fuel cells. Specifically, technological advances are sought in the area of highly efficient, high-pressure proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers. Highly efficient operation reduces the total quantity of reactants required, thereby minimizing weight. The efficiency of electrolysis stacks increases by operating at lower current densities. High-pressure electrolysis eliminates or reduces the need for external gas compression prior to reactant storage. The draw-back of high-pressure operation, however, is the increased diffusion of reactants across the proton exchange membrane of the cell, which effectively decreases the efficiency. This efficiency loss is magnified at lower current densities. The challenge, therefore, is to minimize this diffusion at higher operating pressures and low current densities, making efficient electrolysis operation possible. High-pressure electrolysis systems capable of oxygen and hydrogen gas production at pressures less than 2000 psi are of special interest.

The sizes of these systems range from the small (less than 20m3 for supercritical air and payload cooling) to very large (greater than 3400m3 for LOX and LH2 propellant storage). Advanced cryogenic technologies are being solicited for all these applications. Proposed technologies should offer enhanced safety, reliability, or economic efficiency over current state-of-the-art, or should feature enabling technologies to allow NASA to meet future space exploration goals.

Innovative concepts are requested for cryogenic insulation systems, fluid system components, and instrumentation. Cryogenic propellants such as hydrogen, methane, and oxygen are required for many current and future space missions. Operating efficiency and reliability of these cryogenic systems must be improved considering the launch environment, operations in a space environment, and system life, cost, and safety. This subtopic solicits unique and innovative concepts in the following technologies: 1) Thermal Control Passive Thermal Control: Successful passive thermal control is enabling for all aspects of Cryogenic Fuel Management. The propellant boil-off losses attributable to the passive thermal control subsystem are influenced by Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) design, MLI to tank attachment techniques and materials, tank to vehicle support structure and attachments, tank size and configuration, tank and insulation penetrations, insulation venting provisions for launch and ascent, flight and surface environments, vehicle orientation in those environments, and thermal control surface coatings and materials. Applications/Technology Maturity: The Earth Departure Stage (EDS) and the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) descent stage require LH2 and LO2 storage durations of 5 to 95 days in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The LSAM ascent stage requires LO2 and LCH4 storage durations of up to 95 days in LEO and up to an additional six months on the lunar surface.

Applications/Technology Maturity: Flight-type 20K (LH2) cryocoolers of sufficient cooling capacity (20 watts) to eliminate LH2 boil-off do not exist, and thus the development of 20K cryocoolers is a long-lead technology item. State-of-the-art cryocoolers in the 80K range (LO2/LCH4 temperatures) have been developed for cooling sensors and have flown on numerous satellites. However, the integration of these cryocoolers into an active thermal control system for propellant storage of LO2 and LCH4 and LH2 is a technology issue. Development Needs: Flight cryocooler to propellant tank integration techniques for large space-based storage systems, distributed cooling shields integrated with MLI and development and testing of active cooling techniques for tank penetrations and supports is required. Development of flight-type 20K, 20 watt capacity cryocoolers designed for integration into large space-based LH2 storage systems is also required for application to Mars missions. 2) Pressure Control Controlling cryogenic propellant tank pressure in low gravity with minimum boil-off losses without settling the propellants can be accomplished with a thermodynamic vent system (TVS). A TVS subsystem typically consists of a pump for circulation and mixing, a Joule Thompson expansion device/heat exchanger for heat removal, valves and a vent line.

These RCS engines would operate cryogenic liquid-liquid for applications requiring integration with main engine propellants; or would operate gas-gas or gas-storable liquid for small total impulse type applications. Ascent engine development is projected to be in the 3,500-6,000-lbf thrust class with a target vacuum specific impulse of 355-sec. The engine shall achieve 90% rated thrust within 0.5 second of the issuance of the Engine ON Command.Specific technologies of interest to meet proposed engine requirements include: Low-mass propellant injectors that provide stable, uniform combustion over a wide range of propellant inlet conditions; Combustion chamber designs using high temperature materials, coatings and/or ablatives for combustion chambers, nozzles and nozzle extensions; Combustion chamber thermal control technologies such as regenerative, transpiration, swirl or other cooling methods which offer improved performance and adequate chamber life; Highly-reliable, long-life, fast-acting cryogenic valves that tolerate high thermal loading due to heat soak-back in low-thrust, pulsing propulsion systems (Thermal Isolation less than 1 Btu/hr) with reduced volume and size is also desirable; Highly-reliable, long-life, fast-acting propellant valves for gaseous propellants with reduced power, volume and size.A key risk related to the use of cryogenic and gaseous propellants such as oxygen and methane are the ability to reliably ignite the propellants in a timely manner. This is of particular importance on ascent engines during abort operations. Recently NASA has been conducting a number of investigations into the ignition characteristics for oxygen and methane, primarily for spark torch systems. NASA continues to be interested in new and innovative methods which may be used as primary or back-up systems. Proposals are also solicited for igniter exciter technologies. In particular, for reaction control systems involving multiple engines that are not all co-located, issues between distributed vs. centralized exciter architectures must be balanced when selecting an exciter design. A ""distributed"" system refers to an integral exciter at each spark plug, whereas a ""centralized"" arrangement has at least some exciter components (e.g., DC-DC converter, control electronics, etc.) remotely located (e.g., with other avionics) and shared by multiple engines/spark plugs. Specific technologies of interest include: Reliable ignition systems such as spark torch, catalytic, microwave, combustion wave, laser, etc.; Exciters to support either capacitive (CDI) or inductive (IDI) discharge ignition types; High cycle spark plugs for use with cryogenic and/or gaseous propellants; Cryogenic instrumentation such as pressure and temperature sensors that will operate for months/years instead of hours.

Exploration Systems,Topic X10 Protection Systems ,"X10.01Detachable, Human-rated, Ablative Environmentally Compliant TPS", ARC," GRC, JPL, JSC, LaRC","The Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) will first be used for transporting crew and cargo to the International Space Station and later for the human exploration of the Moon and Mars. The TPS for the CEV will have to protect the crew and cargo from entry heating at entry velocities of approximately 8 km/s for International Space Station missions, 11 km/s for lunar return missions, up to 8 km/s for Martian aerocapture and entry, and between 12-15 km/s for Martian return missions. Ablative TPS is an enabling technology for all CEV superorbital reentry missions. Ablation Modeling The heat shield for CEV will employ a thermal protection system (TPS) material that pyrolyzes and ablates at high temperature for mass-efficient rejection of the aerothermal heat load. Pyrolysis is an internal decomposition of the solid that releases gaseous species, whereas ablation is a combination of processes that consume heat shield surface material (including chemical reactions, melting, and vaporization). For the design and sizing of TPS materials, it is imperative to have reliable simulation tools that can compute surface recession rate, in-depth pyrolysis, and internal temperature histories under general heating conditions. In addition, lunar and Martian reentry environment heating will consist of significant radiation from the shock layer. The models need to include the effect of not only convective but radiative heating as well. Therefore, advances are sought in modeling of radiation, gas surface interactions, ablation mechanisms, pyrolysis, and other processes such as coking and charring. Specifically for charring, advances are sought in the development of a low density charring ablator model to give insight into how conductivity changes as function of temperature and pressure for the virgin material and for the material as it pyrolyzes. Shape Optimization/Entry System Architectures The design of a reentry craft must encompass not only aerothermodynamic heating concerns but also the conflicting constraints of aerodynamic stability, mass, and cross-range performance. Therefore, the TPS cannot be designed in isolation but must be viewed as a part of a whole. Advances are sought in multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) methods such as gradient methods and genetic algorithms. Instrumentation Thermal Protection System (TPS) sensors and experimental diagnostic tools are required to provide traceability of TPS sizing tools, design, and material performance. Traceability will lead to higher fidelity design tools, which in turn will lead to risk reduction and decreased heat shield mass on missions requiring atmospheric aerocapture or entry/reentry. Decreasing heat shield mass will enable certain missions that are not otherwise feasible and directly increase payload. Heat flux sensors and surface recession diagnostic tools are essential to advancing the state of TPS traceability for material modeling and aerothermal simulation. Advances in the understanding of how heat flux sensor performance changes upon integration of the sensors into TPS materials in ablative environments through simulation or experimental investigation are sought. Specifically, the following list of sensor materials is of primary interest:Type K, C, R, and S thermocouples Sapphire windows Inconel superalloys Pure platinum TeflonFor surface recession, advances in optical methods (photometrics/tomography) are sought. Non-destructive Testing Techniques and Novel Techniques for Material Characterization: The CEV heat shield will be the largest ever built. During manufacturing and integration, it will be necessary to understand the variability in material properties, to determine voids and inclusions, to assess bond line integrity, and to ensure that the established flight heat shield requirements are met. For this purpose, advances in NDE and proposals of novel techniques for material characterization applicable for ablative TPS are sought. Ablation Materials Development Early NASA missions employed new ablative TPS materials that were tailored to each specific entry environment. However, after Mars Viking, NASA-sponsored ablative TPS development essentially ceased as the research focus shifted to reusable TPS in support of the Space Shuttle. For example, the Pioneer Venus (1978) and Galileo (1995) missions employed carbon phenolic TPS material that had previously been developed by the United States Air Force for ballistic missile applications. Over the past 40 years, NASA has adopted a risk averse philosophy relative to TPS, i.e., use what was used before since it has been flight-qualified. For Mars Direct Return, the entry velocities will be in the range of 12-15 km/s. Heritage carbon phenolic can satisfy Mars Return requirements however the TPS mass fraction would be less than optimal. Thus, advances toward new reliable and efficient TPS materials are desired. Similarly, development of adhesives, joints, penetrations, and seals are of equal importance and advances are sought. Advances are sought in material development to address survivability in the severe convective and radiative heating environment and to address mass constraints and technological developments to address flow stability concerns and control authority in the face of atmospheric uncertainties and targeting errors. Advances and innovative concepts in integrated TPS design for multi-mission modes (aerocapture followed by entry requiring multi-use ablators vs. multi-layered ablators) are sought. Read less>>"
Exploration Systems,Topic X11 Thermal Management ,X11.01Thermal Control for Surface Systems and Spacecraft, JSC," GRC, GSFC, JPL, MSFC","Advanced technologies are sought for thermal management of Earth-orbiting spacecraft, the human lunar habitat, landers, and rovers, for Martian transit spacecraft, as well as planetary expeditions to Jupiter, Venus, and their moons. Future spacecraft will require more sophisticated thermal control systems that can dissipate or reject greater heat loads at higher input heat fluxes while using fewer of the limited spacecraft mass, volume and power resources. The thermal control designs also must accommodate the harsh environments associated with these missions including dust and high sink temperatures. Modular, reconfigurable designs could limit the number of required spares. Earth-orbiting spacecraft contain instruments, such as LIDAR lasers and electronics systems and/or components, which can generate high thermal dissipation loads at high heat flux rates. Spacecraft instruments can have tight temperature control requirements and/or thermal gradient requirements (micro-Kelvin requirements). Spacecraft instruments operate in temperature regimes ranging from cryogenic to above ambient (-180ºC to +100ºC). Radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) generate relatively large amounts of heat. Design plans for Earth-orbiting spacecraft seek smaller (down to MEMS level components or instruments) and reconfigurable designs. The lunar environment presents several challenges to the design and operation of active thermal control systems. During the Apollo program, landings were located and timed to occur at lunar twilight, resulting in a benign thermal environment. The long duration polar lunar bases that are foreseen in 15 years will see extremely cold thermal environments, as will the radiators for Martian transit spacecraft. Long sojourns remote from low-Earth orbit will require lightweight, but robust and reliable systems. Innovative thermal management components and systems are needed to accomplish the rejection of heat from lunar bases. Advances are sought in the general areas of radiators, thermal control loops and equipment. Radiators on the Moon's poles and on a Martian transit vehicle are required that will operate and survive in very cold environments. Variable emissivity coatings, clever working fluid selection, or robust design could be used to prevent radiator damage from freezing at times of low heat load. Also, the dusty environment of an active lunar base may require dust mitigation and removal techniques to maintain radiator performance over the long term. The lunar base and Martian transit spacecraft active thermal control systems will include high efficiency, long life mechanical pumps. Part of the thermal control system in the lunar base is likely to be a condensing heat exchanger, which should be designed to preclude microbial growth. Small heat pumps could be used to provide cold fluid to the heat exchanger, increasing the average heat rejection temperature and reducing the size of the radiators. Thermal management of the lunar habitat, landers, and rovers may require mechanically pumped two-phase fluid loops. Innovative design of the loops and components is needed. A scaling methodology is needed to allow long term 1-g testing of two-phase systems (including pumped two-phase loops, heat pumps, and condensing heat exchangers) representative of the 1/6th Earth-normal gravity of the Moon.

Exploration Systems,Topic X12 Exploration Crew Health Capabilities ,X12.01Health Preservation in the Space Environment, JSC," ARC, GRC","Living and functioning efficiently and safely in space and in the hypogravity of the Moon (1/6g) or Mars (3/8g), requires an understanding of the effects of micro- and hypogravity and other space-environment related factors on human physiology responses and adaptations to a unique set of imposed demands. As a result, a variety of countermeasures are needed to mitigate the deleterious changes that occur during space flight and upon subsequent exposure to reduced-gravitational environments. The ability to monitor the effectiveness of countermeasures and alterations in human physiology during space exploration missions, particularly when several countermeasures are used concurrently, is equally important. This subtopic seeks innovative technologies in several very specific key areas. As launch costs relate directly to mass and volume, instruments and sensors must be small and lightweight with an emphasis on multi-functional capabilities. Low power consumption is a major factor, as are design enhancements to improve the operation, design reliability, and maintainability of these instruments in the environment of space and on planetary surfaces. As the efficient use of time is extremely important, innovative instrumentation setup, ease of usage, improved astronaut (patient) comfort, noninvasive sensors, and easy-to-read information displays are also very important considerations. Extended shelf-life and ambient storage conditions of consumables are also key necessities. Ability to operate in 0g, 1/6g, and 3/8g become more important as we march towards human Moon and Mars missions. Non-invasive Pharmacotherapy and Monitoring Development of innovative technologies resulting in non-invasive methods for diagnosis, treatment, and therapeutic drug monitoring is needed to facilitate effective pharmacotherapy of humans in space. Many questions remain about the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals in micro- and hypogravity environments, which may interfere with their activity by sensitizing or desensitizing the crew member or interfering in other ways with the desired physiological effect. Micro-encapsulation of drugs and development of novel drug delivery systems under micro- and hypogravity conditions. Devices for continual monitoring of physiology during pharmacotherapy would also be advantageous to ensure that on-orbit expression of therapies relates to on-Earth histories. Non-invasive Technology to Assess Bone Micro- and Macroarchitecture A complete assessment of bone strength will better monitor life-time skeletal integrity and will generate data critical for developing probability fracture risk models in younger-aged crew. Novel technology for non-invasive assessments of ""bone quality"" indices such as microarchitecture, macroarchitecture and trabecular Bone mineral density (BMD). Technologies to Detect Biomarkers Develop technologies to detect products of bone demineralization in urine during Flight and the biomarkers of bone degradation include N-telopeptide (NTX), C-telopeptide (CTX), pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline collagen cross-links, and calcium ion. Develop technologies to monitor bone specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin in serum samples. Portable Motion Simulator Develop a portable research platform to investigate the influence of spatial disorientation on manual control tasks during lunar-type landings. A 6-DOF motion simulator with full visual motion display will be developed to simulate landing tasks with and with visual motion (brownout) conditions. The simulator should be portable, and fit within standard (8 ft) room heights. The power requirements should be limited to 240VAC 30A. The subject restraint should accommodate both standing and seated positions. The control system should allow the user to import motion profiles, and provide the capability to evaluate various pilot-induced filter (PIO) options from a hand-held controller. Read less>>"

Exploration Systems,Topic X12 Exploration Crew Health Capabilities ,X12.03Exploration Medical Capability, GRC," ARC, JSC","On-board clinical diagnostics to monitor crew member physiology must be available for both mid-term lunar and long-term Mars exploration missions. As in terrestrial medicine, devices with which to measure multiple constituents of small volume samples of bodily fluids are crucial components in assessing astronaut health. Nevertheless, mass, space, and power requirements of such devices are an obvious concern in an environment with scarce resources. Miniaturized laboratory analysis sensors represent a potential solution, given that these devices and supporting hardware are designed to be small, lightweight, and require little power. However, current sensor cartridges are typically single-use with limited shelf life. In order to satisfy the needs of longer duration exploration missions, reusable laboratory analysis sensors with increased shelf life must be designed without compromising accuracy or sensitivity. NASA seeks proposals for developing such reusable laboratory analysis sensors for measuring complete blood count with differential. Both the actual chips and associated electronics should minimize the use of electrical power and be as small as possible. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward a Phase 2 breadboard demonstration. Read less>>"
Exploration Systems,Topic X13 Space Human Factors and Food Systems ,X13.01Space Human Factors Assessment Tools, JSC, ARC,"The Human Research Program (HRP) and the Behavioral Health and Performance Research Program (BHP) are among NASA's major Space Human Factors research programs. In collaboration with these two programs, the SBIR program is looking for research proposals that address the following two research areas: (1) an Automated Human Factors Incident Reporting Tool (AHFIRT) and (2) a Cognitive Assessment Tool (CAT). Automated Human Factors Incident Reporting Tool (AHFIRT) The HRP provides human health and performance countermeasures, knowledge, technologies, and tools to enable safe, reliable, and productive long-duration human space exploration. Objectives of the HRP include developing capabilities and technologies to support and mitigate risks to crew health and performance, reducing human systems resource requirements (mass, volume, power, data, etc.), and ensuring effective human-system integration across exploration systems. To support these objectives, the HRP determines that obtaining timely and context-specific Human Factors (HF) incidents data is a technology gap the program wants to address. Currently, space HF data come from crew debriefs. Such debriefs rely on retrospective recall, which could suffer delays of up to six months. Furthermore, opportunities to discuss HF issues in detail during these debriefs are limited. Consequently, the HRP sees the need to develop an Automated Human Factors Incident Reporting Tool (AHFIRT). Objective: Development of an AHFIRT that assists the gathering and reporting HF incidents for long-duration space missions. Requirements: In general, the AHFIRT will be used to help detect areas where HF can contribute to mission success, access the effects of operational and hardware changes, and complement existing HF data sources for operations including crew debriefs. Specifically, the AHFIRT shall meet the following requirements: The crew shall have easy access to the tool at any time to eliminate the need for the crew to recall information retrospectively. An easy-to-use data gathering protocol with the following functionalities: Allow data to be entered either as text, audio, and/or video inputs It is desirable for AHFIRT to detect system anomaly automatically and immediately record system status. At the minimum, however, the tools should provide an easily accessible event marker for the crew to mark the context and take a snapshot of the system and operator system status. Provide a user-friendly automated data search engine for extracting meaningful incident information from the raw data. Examples of desirable search schemes include natural language, spatial, temporal searches, etc.Phase 1 Requirements: Technology Evaluation The technical merit of the AHFIRT will be explored to evaluate feasibility. This process shall include:Evaluating/researching/developing automated data mining technologies Defining optimal data gathering protocol Determining optimal hardware/software design Developing hardware and software algorithmsPhase 2 Requirements: Prototype Development The process shall include:Developing a working AHFIRT prototype Evaluate and test the functionality and usability of the prototype deviceCognitive Assessment Tool (CAT) The NASA Behavioral Health and Performance Research Program (BHP) identifies and characterizes the behavioral health and performance risks associated with training, living and working in Space, and return to Earth. The BHP Research Element develops strategies, tools, and technologies to mitigate these risks. Currently, the BHP has the need for a Cognitive Assessment Tool (CAT). Due to the high-intensity workload, disturbed sleep conditions, and other stressors of spaceflight, some astronauts have reported experiences of disturbed cognitive processes and fatigue. Presently, a tool is utilized on the International Space Station (ISS) to detect neurocognitive deficits as a result of physical changes to the brain, which can occur from an injury to the head or exposure to a toxin. However, this assessment is designed as a programmed test that is not sensitive to crewmember fatigue. Consequently, there has been increased interest for a validated tool that that can: Detect cognitive decrements as a result of fatigue or other stressors of spaceflight Support the Astronauts with an entertaining assessment activity(s) Support crew autonomy by providing objective feedback directly to the crewmember regarding their behavioral healthObjective: Design, develop, and fabricate a handheld, CAT that is in the form of a video game. Requirements: The CAT game may include a suite of games as opposed to one single game. Ideally, the game would determine whether the player's deficit is a result of fatigue, stress, or neurocognitive impairment. Specifically, the CAT shall be as follows:In a hand-held video game format Portable hand-held unit Enjoyable and entertaining Flexible enough for increasing levels of difficulty Able to detect and identify cognitive decrements catalysts such as fatigue, stress, and/or neurocognitive deficits Able to provide immediate feedback to crewmembers, especially flight surgeons, with recommended countermeasure(s) based on his/her cognitive performance to support crew autonomyPotential means for the CAT to assess performance may include measures of:Reaction times Accuracies Memory recall Complex decision making Physiological measures, such as heat rate via thumbs Speech acoustic analysis Facial monitoring Eye analysisNote that the aforementioned methods are provided as examples of current research developments and are not intended as an all-inclusive or restrictive mandate for the development of the CAT. Phase 1 Requirements: CAT Start-Up The technical merit of the CAT will be explored to evaluate feasibility. This process will include:Defining predictors of cognitive decrements Determining which aspects of cognition should be assessed Determining optimal hardware design Hardware and software algorithms developmentPhase 2 Requirements: CAT Research and Development Content development of the CAT games should be determined based upon results of a qualitative study conducted with sample population (similar to Astronauts) to ensure corroboration and interest prior to the following stages:Develop software for gaming, data analysis, feedback, and recommended countermeasures Develop prototype hardware Develop manual and trouble shooting guide Evaluate and test the functionality of the prototype device.

Exploration Systems,Topic X13 Space Human Factors and Food Systems ,X13.02Advanced Food Technologies, JSC, ARC,"The purpose of the Advanced Food Technology Project is to develop, evaluate and deliver food technologies for human centered spacecraft that will support crews on missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. Safe, nutritious, acceptable, and varied shelf-stable foods with a shelf life of 3 - 5 years will be required to support the crew during future exploration missions to the Moon or Mars. Concurrently, the food system must efficiently balance appropriate vehicle resources such as mass, volume, water, air, waste, power, and crew time. One of the objectives during the lunar outpost missions is to test technologies that can be used during the Mars missions. This subtopic will concentrate on two specific areas; food packaging and lunar outpost food preparation and food processing. Non-Foil High Barrier Materials Development of shelf-stable food items that use high-quality ingredients is important to maintaining a healthy diet and the psychosocial well being of the crew. Shelf-life extension may be attained through new food preservation methods and/or packaging. New food packaging technologies are needed that have adequate oxygen and water barrier properties to maintain the foods' quality over a 3 - 5 year shelf life. The packaging must also minimize waste by using high barrier packaging with less mass and volume. The current flexible pouch packaging used for the thermostabilized and irradiated food items contains a layer of foil. Although the foil provides excellent oxygen and water barrier properties, it also contributes to added waste. Food packaging will be a major contributor to the trash on the lunar or Mars surface. One of the proposed methods to dispose of trash on the lunar or Mars surface is incineration. However, the foil layer will not incinerate completely and there will be ash formed. Two emerging food preservation technologies, high pressure processing and microwave processing, are being considered for future NASA missions. However the current high barrier packaging material cannot be used for these processes. The material delaminates during high pressure processing and cannot be used in microwave processing. Hence, any food packaging material developed in response to this subtopic should be compatible with one or more of the following food preservation technologies - retort processing, microwave processing, and/or high pressure processing. In addition, the material should have an oxygen transmission rate that shall not exceed 0.06 cc/m2/24 hrs/atm and a water vapor transmission rate that shall not exceed 0.01 gm/m2/24 hrs as stated in the MIL-PRF 33073F specification. Effect of Partial Gravity and Reduced Atmospheric Pressure It will require approximately 10,000 kg of packaged food for a 6-crew, 1000 day mission to Mars. For that reason, it has been proposed to use a food system which incorporates processing of raw ingredients into edible ingredients and uses these edible ingredients in recipes in the galley to produce meals. This type of food system will require food processing and food preparation equipment. The equipment should be miniaturized, multipurpose and efficiently use vehicle resources such as mass, volume, water, and power. Food preparation may include gourmet kitchen appliances such as food processors or bread makers in addition to the standard stove and oven. Proposed food processing equipment may include a mill to produce wheat and soy flour, a soy milk/tofu processor, and a concentrator. The Moon's gravity is 1/6 of Earth's gravity. In addition, it is being proposed that the habitat will have a reduced atmospheric pressure of 8 psia which is equivalent to a 16,000 foot mountain top. These two factors will affect the heat and mass transfer during food processing and food preparation of the food. Heat transfer is required for proper microbial kill and to produce the desired texture and appearance of the food prior to consumption. At this pressure, the boiling temperature of water will be 181°F which has significant implications for preventing microbial contamination and to acceptable food quality. Prior to any design of food processing or preparation equipment, the effects of partial gravity and partial atmospheric pressure as it relates to fluid management, heat and mass transfer and chemical reactions must be determined. Once the effects are determined, countermeasures must be developed. All of this needs to happen prior to any fabrication of actual food processing or food preparation equipment that can be used in the Lunar Habitat. The response to this subtopic should (1) develop food packaging technologies that respond the above requirements, (2) develop a technology which will aid in determining the effects of reduced cabin pressure and reduced gravity and/or (3) develop a technology that will enable safe and timely food processing and food preparation in reduced cabin pressure and reduced gravity.

Exploration Systems,Topic X14 Space Radiation ,X14.01Small Personal Dosimetry, JSC," ARC, GSFC","Background: As astronauts return to the Moon, and this time, work for extended periods, there will be a critical need for crew personnel radiation monitoring as they perform a myriad of extravehicular activities (EVAs). Increased ISS crew size and mission duration are also driving the need for during-mission evaluation of crew specific radiation exposures. The components of the radiation field, both primary and secondary particles, can vary significantly in charge, energy, and intensity between galactic cosmic rays and solar particle events (SPEs). This dynamic and complex radiation environment requires the development of suitable detection systems that can meet the requirements of each component of the field. Of particular concern is the need for active monitoring capabilities that provide relevant radiation personal dosimetry information for long term galactic cosmic ray exposure (including neutron secondary radiation) and for short term high dose rate SPEs. In addition to a complex Lunar radiation environment, which must be detected while electronics are protected by radiation hardening, there are restrictions on size, weight, power availability, and data transmission, as well as challenges presented by the Lunar surface environment, such as dust, temperature, and UV radiation. If mounted on or in the EVA suit, suit constraints must be addressed and crew safety ensured. For daily mission use, the requirements on size, data storage, and battery life/operation are particularly challenging. Requirements/Needs: Advanced spaceflight detector systems to provide reliable environment data for a specific spectrum of energies, including: real time dosimetry providing dose and particle types and energies and cumulative dosimeters for characterizing space environments for use onboard spacecraft and planetary surfaces as well as alarm systems for Solar Particle Events. Dosimeters should provide time resolved linear energy transfer (LET) data and have embedded LET-based quality factor algorithms for determining dose equivalent. New software needs to be fault tolerant and compatible with current operating systems, new hardware and software must be fully documented (schematics, etc.). The expected radiation environment includes protons from 10 Mev to 1 GeV, electrons from .5 Mev to 7 Mev, primary and secondary HZEs (He to Fe) from 10 Mev/amu to 1 Gev/amu and secondary neutrons from 1 Mev to 200 Mev. NASA acknowledges the difficulty in measuring secondary neutrons from interactions of protons and heavy ions with spacecraft structures and has particular interest in this area. For EVA and Mission NeedsThe dosimeter should be an omnidirectional detector system that can continuously measure and record the absorbed dose from charged particles with linear energy transfer 0.2 to 300 keV/micrometer, as a function of time, at two shielding depths: 0.5 g/cm2 and 3 g/cm2. The dosimeter should measure cumulative absorbed dose and dose equivalent once per minute and report data with latency less than five minutes. The dosimeter should produce and alarm whenever the absorbed dose rate exceeds a programmable threshold in the range 0.05 mGy/min to 10 mGy/min for 3 consecutive 1 minute readings. The dosimeter dimensions should be no larger than 8.5 cm x 4.5 cm x 2 cm. The dosimeter should weigh no more than 150 g.Additional Mission Only NeedsThe dosimeter should be able to be battery (re-chargeable) powered and operate for 14 days without re-charge. The dosimeter shall be able to measure dose rates in the range 0.005 mGy/hour (0.0075 mSv/hour) to 1 cGy/hour (1.5 cSv/hour) The dosimeter should able to measure neutron exposure (personal dose equivalent) in the energy rage 0.5 MeV to 10 MeV, with dose equivalent sensitivity of 0.2 mSv to 0.1 Sv in a 1 hour measurement, delivered at 0.02 mSv/hour to 1 mSv/hour.Additional EVA Only NeedsFor suit based versions, the dosimeter would interface to the EVA suit with TBR power available. No battery is allowed for suit versions. The dosimeter shall be able to measure dose rates in the range 0.005 mGy/hour (0.0075 mGy-Eq/hour for proton fields in the energy 10 MeV to 300 MeV) to 70 cGy/hour (105 cGy-Eq/hour for proton fields in the energy range 10 MeV to 300 MeV).

At present NASA has active detectors for ISS that measure energy fluence of charged particles; however, more compact detection systems that measures energy fluence and spectrum for Exploration class missions are needed. Advanced technologies (up to technology readiness level (TRL) level 4) are requested. Subtopic Requirements/Needs: Of particular interest are compact real-time detection systems that can measure energy fluence and spectrum of protons and other ions (Z = 2 to 26) and be sensitive to charged particles with LET of 0.2 to 1000 keV/µm. For Z less than 3, the spectrometer should detect energies in the range 20 MeV/n to 400 MeV/n. For Z = 3 to 26, the spectrometer should detect energies in the range 50 MeV/n to 1 GeV/n. The monitor should be able to measure charged particles at both ambient conditions in space (0.005 mGy/hr) and during a large solar particle event (1000 mGy/hr). The time resolution should be less than or equal to 1 minute. The dosimeter shall be able to perform data reduction internally and provide processed data out to ISS, CEV, and future lunar outpost data systems. New software needs to be fault tolerant and updated to current operating systems, new hardware and software must be fully documented (schematics, etc.). Read less>>"
Exploration Systems,Topic X14 Space Radiation ,X14.03Neutron Spectroscopy, ARC," GSFC, JSC","Neutrons can contribute a significant fraction to the total dose-equivalent received by astronauts. Current instruments at NASA, and those under development, can provide the total (combined) dose and dose-equivalent for protons, heavy ions, gamma rays, and neutrons. At present, neutrons are included as integral measurements of NASA space flights; however compact active detection systems that can measure neutrons only are needed. Advanced technologies (up to technology readiness level (TRL) level 4) are requested. Subtopic Requirements/Needs: Systems are needed specifically to measure the neutron component of the dose and provide the neutron dose-equivalent in real time. Of interest also would be compact active monitoring devices that could measure neutron energy spectra. The principal energies of interest are neutrons from 0.5 MeV to 150 MeV. The monitor should be able to measure neutrons at ambient conditions such that proton/ion veto capability should be approaching 100% at solar minimum GCR rates. During solar particle events, neutrons will be present at increased levels and should also be measured. The device should be able to measure ambient dose equivalent of 0.02 mSv in a 1 hour measurement period, using ICRP 74 (1997) conversion factors. The instrument shall be able to perform data reduction internally and provide processed data out to ISS, CEV, and or future lunar outpost data systems. New software needs to be fault tolerant and updated to current operating systems, new hardware and software must be fully documented (schematics, etc.). Read less>>"

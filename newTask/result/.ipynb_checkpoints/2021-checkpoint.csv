Critical NASA electric propulsion needs have been identified in the scope areas detailed below. Proposals outside the described scope shall not be considered. Proposers are expected to show an understanding of the current state of the art (SOA) and quantitatively (not just qualitatively) describe anticipated improvements over relevant SOA materials, processes, and technologies that substantiate NASA investment.To shape the magnetic fields needed for operations, Hall-effect thrusters utilize a magnetic circuit that also forms the thruster structure. The magnetic circuit components direct magnetic flux (typically produced by electromagnetic coils) and may experience operational temperatures in excess of 500 °C due to coil self-heating and the close proximity of plasma-wetted surfaces. Both low-carbon magnetic iron and cobalt-iron (Co-Fe) soft ferromagnetic alloys have been traditionally used in the role; low-carbon magnetic iron is typically cheaper with larger billet size availability, whereas Co-Fe soft ferromagnetic alloys are attractive due to high magnetic saturation and Curie temperature properties. As Hall-effect thrusters become larger to support future high-power applications, thruster components also experience and must survive increased inertial launch loads. To address this issue, prospective magnetic circuit materials are desired with improved structural strength compared to SOA options while retaining comparable or better magnetic and thermal properties. Prospective materials capable of being produced in machinable, large-diameter (i.e., >400 mm) solid billets—or that can be additively manufactured to achieve comparable sizes—are of particular interest.

The study identified HeXe Brayton as the baseline dynamic power convertor in the reference NEP concept, with supercritical CO2 Brayton and K-Rankine as the primary options. Current state-of-the-art Brayton technology has been demonstrated in a relevant space environment (ground test) in the 10s of kWe range.

Focus Area 3 Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration,T10.05Integrated Data Uncertainty Management and Representation for Trustworthy and Trusted Autonomy in Space, LaRC," GSFC, JPL", 2021,Integrated Data Uncertainty Management and Representation for Trustworthy and Trusted Autonomy in Space,"Multi-agent Cyber-Physical-Human (CPH) teams in future space missions must include machine agents with a high degree of autonomy. In the context of this subtopic, by “autonomy” we mean the capacity and authority of an agent (human or machine) for independent decision-making and execution in a specified context. We refer to machine agents with these attributes as autonomous systems (AS). In multi-agent CPH teams, humans may serve as remote mission supervisors or as immediate mission teammates, along with AS. AS may function as teammates with specified independence, but under the ultimate human direction. Alternatively, AS may exercise complete independence in decision-making and operations in pursuit of given mission goals; for instance, for control of uncrewed missions for planetary infrastructure development in preparation for human presence, or maintenance and operation of crew habitats during the crew’s absence.In all cases, trustworthiness and trust are essential in CPH teams. The term “trustworthiness” denotes the degree to which the system performs as intended and does not perform prohibited actions in a specified context. “Trust” denotes the degree of readiness by an agent (human or machine) to accept direction or advice from another agent (human or machine), also in a specified context. In common sense terms, trust is a confidence in a system’s trustworthiness, which in turn, is the ability to perform actions with desired outcomes.Because behind every action lies a decision-making problem, trustworthiness of a system can be viewed in terms of the soundness of decision-making by the system participants. Accurate and relevant information forms the basis of sound decision-making. In this subtopic, we focus on data that inform CPH team decision-making, both in human-machine and machine-machine interactions, from two perspectives: the quality of the data and the representation of the data in support of trusted human-machine and machine-machine interactions.We consider data exchanges in multi-agent CPH teams that include AS. Data exchanges in multi-agent teams must be subject to the following conditions:Known data accuracy, noise characteristics, and resolution, as a function of the physical sensors in relevant environments. Known data accuracy, noise characteristics, and resolution as a function of data interpretation if the contributing sensors have a perception component or if data are delivered to an agent via another perception engine (e.g., visual recognition based on deep learning). Known data provenance and integrity. Dynamic anomaly detection in data streams during operations. Comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) of data from a single source. Data fusion and combined UQ, if multiple sources of data are used for decision-making. If data from either a single source or fused data from multiple sources are used for decision-making by an agent (human or machine), the data and the attendant UQ must be transformed into a representation conducive to and productive for decision-making. This may include data filtering, compression, or expansion, among other approaches. UQ must be accompanied by a sensitivity analysis of the mission/operation/action goals with respect to uncertainties in various data, to enable appropriate risk estimation and risk-based decision-making by relevant agents, human or machine. Tools for real-time, a priori, and aposteriori data analysis, with explanations relevant to participating agents. For instance, if machine learning is used for visual data perception in decision-making by humans, methods of interpretable or explainable AI (XAI) may be in order.We note that deep learning and machine learning, in general, are not the chief focus of this subtopic. The techniques are mentioned as an example of tools that may participate in data processing. If such tools are used, the representation of the results to decision-makers (human or machine) must be suitably interpretable and equipped with UQ.Addressing the entire set of the conditions listed above would likely be impractical in a single proposal. Therefore, proposers may offer methods and tools for addressing a subset of conditions.Proposers should offer both a general approach to achieving a chosen subset of the listed conditions and a specific application of the general approach to appropriate data types. The future orbiting or surface stations are potential example platforms, because the environment would include a variety of autonomous systems used for habitat maintenance when the station is uninhabited, continual system health management, crew health, robotic assembly, and cyber security, among other functions. However, the proposers may choose any relevant design reference mission for demonstration of proposed approaches to integrated data uncertainty management and representation, subject to a convincing substantiation of the generalizability and scalability of the approach to relevant practical systems, missions, and environments.",2 to 4,"Level 1: TX 10 Autonomous Systems

Software","Since UQ and management in data is an overarching theme in this subtopic, an analysis of uncertainties in the processes and data must be present in all final deliverables, both in Phases I and II.Phase I: For the areas selected in the proposal, the following deliverables would be in order:Thorough but succinct analysis of the state of the art in the proposed area under investigation. Detailed description of the problem used as the context for algorithm development, including substantiation for why this is a representative problem for a set of applications relevant to NASA missions. Detailed description of the approach, including pseudocode, and the attendant design of experiments for testing and evaluation. Hypotheses about the scalability and generalizability of the proposed approach to realistic problems relevant to NASA missions. Preliminary software and process implementation. Preliminary demonstration of the software. Thorough analysis of performance and gaps. Detailed plan for Phase II, including the design reference mission and the attendant technical problem. Items 1 to 8 documented in a final report for Phase I.Phase II:Detailed description and analysis of the design reference mission and the technical problem selected in Phase I, in collaboration with NASA Contracting Officer Representative (COR)/Technical Monitor (TM). Detailed description of the approach/algorithms developed further for application to the Phase II design reference mission and problem, including pseudocode, and the design of experiments for testing and evaluation. Demonstration of the algorithms, software, methods, and processes. Thorough analysis of performance and gaps, including scalability and applicability to NASA missions. Resulting code. Detailed plan for potential Phase III. Items 1 to 5 documented in a final report for Phase II.","Despite progress in real-time data analytics, serious gaps remain that will present an obstacle to the operation of systems in NASA missions that require heavy participation of autonomous systems, both in human-machine teams and in uncrewed environments, whether temporary or permanent. The gaps come under two main categories:Quality of the information based on various data sources—Trustworthiness of the data is essential in making decisions with desired outcomes. This gap can be summarized as the lack of reliable and actionable UQ associated with data, as well as the difficulty of detecting anomalies in data and combining data from disparate sources, ensuring appropriate quality of the result. Representation of the data to decision-makers (human or machine) that is conducive to trustworthy decision-making—We distinguish raw data from useful information of appropriate complexity and form. Transforming data, single-source or fused, into information productive for decision-making, especially by humans, is a challenge.Specific gaps are listed under the Scope Description as conditions the subsets of which must be addressed by proposers.","The technologies developed as a result of this subtopic would be directly applicable to the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), Science Mission Directorate (SMD), Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD), and Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD), as all of these mission directorates are heavy users of data and growing users of autonomous systems. For instance, the Gateway mission will need a significant presence of autonomous systems, as well as human-machine team operations that rely on autonomous systems for habitat maintenance when the station is uninhabited, continual system health management, crew health, robotic assembly, among other functions. Human presence on the Moon surface will require similar functions, as well as future missions to Mars. All trustworthy decision-making relies on trustworthy data. This topic addresses gaps in data trustworthiness, as well as productive data representation to human-machine teams for sound decision-making.The subtopic is also directly applicable to ARMD missions and goals, because future airspace will heavily rely on autonomous systems. Thus, the subtopic is applicable to such projects as Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP)/Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) and Air Traffic Management—eXploration ATM-X. The technologies developed as a result of this subtopic would be applicable to the National Airspace System (NAS) in the near future as well, because of the need to process data related to vehicle and system performance.","

Focus Area 3 Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration,T10.05Integrated Data Uncertainty Management and Representation for Trustworthy and Trusted Autonomy in Space, LaRC," GSFC, JPL", 2021,Integrated Data Uncertainty Management and Representation for Trustworthy and Trusted Autonomy in Space,"Multi-agent Cyber-Physical-Human (CPH) teams in future space missions must include machine agents with a high degree of autonomy. In the context of this subtopic, by “autonomy” we mean the capacity and authority of an agent (human or machine) for independent decision-making and execution in a specified context. We refer to machine agents with these attributes as autonomous systems (AS). In multi-agent CPH teams, humans may serve as remote mission supervisors or as immediate mission teammates, along with AS. AS may function as teammates with specified independence, but under the ultimate human direction. Alternatively, AS may exercise complete independence in decision-making and operations in pursuit of given mission goals; for instance, for control of uncrewed missions for planetary infrastructure development in preparation for human presence, or maintenance and operation of crew habitats during the crew’s absence.In all cases, trustworthiness and trust are essential in CPH teams. The term “trustworthiness” denotes the degree to which the system performs as intended and does not perform prohibited actions in a specified context. “Trust” denotes the degree of readiness by an agent (human or machine) to accept direction or advice from another agent (human or machine), also in a specified context. In common sense terms, trust is a confidence in a system’s trustworthiness, which in turn, is the ability to perform actions with desired outcomes.Because behind every action lies a decision-making problem, trustworthiness of a system can be viewed in terms of the soundness of decision-making by the system participants. Accurate and relevant information forms the basis of sound decision-making. In this subtopic, we focus on data that inform CPH team decision-making, both in human-machine and machine-machine interactions, from two perspectives: the quality of the data and the representation of the data in support of trusted human-machine and machine-machine interactions.We consider data exchanges in multi-agent CPH teams that include AS. Data exchanges in multi-agent teams must be subject to the following conditions:Known data accuracy, noise characteristics, and resolution, as a function of the physical sensors in relevant environments. Known data accuracy, noise characteristics, and resolution as a function of data interpretation if the contributing sensors have a perception component or if data are delivered to an agent via another perception engine (e.g., visual recognition based on deep learning). Known data provenance and integrity. Dynamic anomaly detection in data streams during operations. Comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) of data from a single source. Data fusion and combined UQ, if multiple sources of data are used for decision-making. If data from either a single source or fused data from multiple sources are used for decision-making by an agent (human or machine), the data and the attendant UQ must be transformed into a representation conducive to and productive for decision-making. This may include data filtering, compression, or expansion, among other approaches. UQ must be accompanied by a sensitivity analysis of the mission/operation/action goals with respect to uncertainties in various data, to enable appropriate risk estimation and risk-based decision-making by relevant agents, human or machine. Tools for real-time, a priori, and aposteriori data analysis, with explanations relevant to participating agents. For instance, if machine learning is used for visual data perception in decision-making by humans, methods of interpretable or explainable AI (XAI) may be in order.We note that deep learning and machine learning, in general, are not the chief focus of this subtopic. The techniques are mentioned as an example of tools that may participate in data processing. If such tools are used, the representation of the results to decision-makers (human or machine) must be suitably interpretable and equipped with UQ.Addressing the entire set of the conditions listed above would likely be impractical in a single proposal. Therefore, proposers may offer methods and tools for addressing a subset of conditions.Proposers should offer both a general approach to achieving a chosen subset of the listed conditions and a specific application of the general approach to appropriate data types. The future orbiting or surface stations are potential example platforms, because the environment would include a variety of autonomous systems used for habitat maintenance when the station is uninhabited, continual system health management, crew health, robotic assembly, and cyber security, among other functions.

This may include data filtering, compression, or expansion, among other approaches. UQ must be accompanied by a sensitivity analysis of the mission/operation/action goals with respect to uncertainties in various data, to enable appropriate risk estimation and risk-based decision-making by relevant agents, human or machine. Tools for real-time, a priori, and aposteriori data analysis, with explanations relevant to participating agents. For instance, if machine learning is used for visual data perception in decision-making by humans, methods of interpretable or explainable AI (XAI) may be in order.We note that deep learning and machine learning, in general, are not the chief focus of this subtopic. The techniques are mentioned as an example of tools that may participate in data processing. If such tools are used, the representation of the results to decision-makers (human or machine) must be suitably interpretable and equipped with UQ.Addressing the entire set of the conditions listed above would likely be impractical in a single proposal. Therefore, proposers may offer methods and tools for addressing a subset of conditions.Proposers should offer both a general approach to achieving a chosen subset of the listed conditions and a specific application of the general approach to appropriate data types. The future orbiting or surface stations are potential example platforms, because the environment would include a variety of autonomous systems used for habitat maintenance when the station is uninhabited, continual system health management, crew health, robotic assembly, and cyber security, among other functions. However, the proposers may choose any relevant design reference mission for demonstration of proposed approaches to integrated data uncertainty management and representation, subject to a convincing substantiation of the generalizability and scalability of the approach to relevant practical systems, missions, and environments.",2 to 4,"Level 1: TX 10 Autonomous Systems

Analysis
Software","Since UQ and management in data is an overarching theme in this subtopic, an analysis of uncertainties in the processes and data must be present in all final deliverables, both in Phases I and II.Phase I: For the areas selected in the proposal, the following deliverables would be in order:Thorough but succinct analysis of the state of the art in the proposed area under investigation. Detailed description of the problem used as the context for algorithm development, including substantiation for why this is a representative problem for a set of applications relevant to NASA missions. Detailed description of the approach, including pseudocode, and the attendant design of experiments for testing and evaluation. Hypotheses about the scalability and generalizability of the proposed approach to realistic problems relevant to NASA missions. Preliminary software and process implementation. Preliminary demonstration of the software. Thorough analysis of performance and gaps. Detailed plan for Phase II, including the design reference mission and the attendant technical problem. Items 1 to 8 documented in a final report for Phase I.Phase II:Detailed description and analysis of the design reference mission and the technical problem selected in Phase I, in collaboration with NASA Contracting Officer Representative (COR)/Technical Monitor (TM). Detailed description of the approach/algorithms developed further for application to the Phase II design reference mission and problem, including pseudocode, and the design of experiments for testing and evaluation. Demonstration of the algorithms, software, methods, and processes. Thorough analysis of performance and gaps, including scalability and applicability to NASA missions. Resulting code. Detailed plan for potential Phase III. Items 1 to 5 documented in a final report for Phase II.","Despite progress in real-time data analytics, serious gaps remain that will present an obstacle to the operation of systems in NASA missions that require heavy participation of autonomous systems, both in human-machine teams and in uncrewed environments, whether temporary or permanent. The gaps come under two main categories:Quality of the information based on various data sources—Trustworthiness of the data is essential in making decisions with desired outcomes. This gap can be summarized as the lack of reliable and actionable UQ associated with data, as well as the difficulty of detecting anomalies in data and combining data from disparate sources, ensuring appropriate quality of the result. Representation of the data to decision-makers (human or machine) that is conducive to trustworthy decision-making—We distinguish raw data from useful information of appropriate complexity and form. Transforming data, single-source or fused, into information productive for decision-making, especially by humans, is a challenge.Specific gaps are listed under the Scope Description as conditions the subsets of which must be addressed by proposers.","The technologies developed as a result of this subtopic would be directly applicable to the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), Science Mission Directorate (SMD), Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD), and Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD), as all of these mission directorates are heavy users of data and growing users of autonomous systems. For instance, the Gateway mission will need a significant presence of autonomous systems, as well as human-machine team operations that rely on autonomous systems for habitat maintenance when the station is uninhabited, continual system health management, crew health, robotic assembly, among other functions. Human presence on the Moon surface will require similar functions, as well as future missions to Mars. All trustworthy decision-making relies on trustworthy data. This topic addresses gaps in data trustworthiness, as well as productive data representation to human-machine teams for sound decision-making.The subtopic is also directly applicable to ARMD missions and goals, because future airspace will heavily rely on autonomous systems. Thus, the subtopic is applicable to such projects as Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP)/Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) and Air Traffic Management—eXploration ATM-X. The technologies developed as a result of this subtopic would be applicable to the National Airspace System (NAS) in the near future as well, because of the need to process data related to vehicle and system performance.","

This facility will serve as a starting point for missions to cislunar space and beyond. It could enable assembly and servicing of telescopes and deep space exploration vehicles. It could also be used as a platform for astrophysics, Earth observation, heliophysics, and lunar science.In contrast to the International Space Station (ISS), which is continuously manned, Gateway is expected to be occupied by humans only intermittently—perhaps only 1 month per year. Consequently, there is a significant need for Gateway to have autonomous capabilities for performing payload operations and spacecraft caretaking, particularly when astronauts are not present. Similar capabilities are needed for future lunar or planetary surface habitats. Intravehicular activity (IVA) robots can potentially perform a wide variety of tasks, including systems inspection, monitoring, diagnostics and repair, logistics and consumables stowage, exploration capability testing, aggregation of robotically returned destination surface samples, and science measurements and operations.The objective of this subtopic is to develop technologies that can improve the capability or performance of IVA robots to perform payload operations and spacecraft caretaking. Proposals are specifically sought to create technologies that can be integrated and tested with the NASA Astrobee, Robonaut 2, or other NASA robots in the following areas:Sensors and perception systems for performing contact tasks; manipulation; and/or interior environment monitoring, inspection, modeling, and navigation. Robotic tools for manipulating logistics and stowage or performing maintenance, housekeeping, or emergency management operations (e.g., fire detection and suppression in multiple constrained locations or cleaning lunar dust out of air filters). Operational subsystems that enable extended robot operations (power systems, efficient propulsion, etc.); increase robot autonomy via computationally efficient methods (planning, scheduling, and task execution); or improve human-robot interaction between IVA robots and human teams on the ground under communications constraints, including low bandwidth and extended loss-of-signal periods (software architecture, remote operations methods, etc.).This subtopic also seeks to advance technologies that will enable the next generation of IVA robots to operate in lunar surface habitats, including:Novel robotic end effectors capable of reliably performing fine grasping tasks, such as plugging and unplugging MIL-STD-38999 electrical connectors and fluid quick-disconnect connectors. Compact, reliable, modular robotic actuators and controllers for IVA robots. Software that enables autonomous management of robot operational and hardware faults such that the robot can “fail operational.” For example, the software may use algorithms to determine how to automatically respond to a failure in a motion planner for move to a commanded location by taking into account a projected collision and replanning to the next closest point not in collision.",4 to 5,"Level 1: TX 04 Robotics Systems

This latter concept has been referred to as bioregenerative life support. To do this will require controlled environments for growing the crops, perhaps using techniques similar to recirculating hydroponics used on Earth. But this will require careful monitoring of the environment and the plants themselves to assess their health and performance. In addition, crew time will likely be limited in many space settings, so having the monitoring systems operate autonomously or with little human intervention would be beneficial.This subtopic solicits advanced technologies for remotely sensing the status of plants in controlled environments of space. These environments are typically small in volume, often use narrow band lighting from light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and are subject to reduced gravity. Example methods might include multispectral and hyperspectral sensing of crops, use of bio-indicators in the crops themselves, or other innovative, noninvasive means. Technologies could focus on approaches for (1) monitoring the morphology and growth of plants and possibly standing biomass and/or (2) monitoring stress to the plants, including water stress, nutrient stress, and plant pathogens.

Within the APH, environmental control includes light from LEDs, temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide concentration, along with water delivery to a solid medium used to support root systems. The APH is used primarily for plant research on the ISS, and the environmental parameters are logged regularly. Plants in the APH chamber can be monitored with visible imagery and infrared sensing for canopy temperatures. The APH is closed atmospherically to allow condensate recovery and water recycling and to also track plant carbon dioxide uptake and evapotranspiration. Larger plant chambers used for crop production on future missions would build on these capabilities, but may or may not be atmospherically closed to the crew cabin.","This technology could be proven on the ISS and would be useful to long-duration human exploration missions, including Gateway, lunar surface, and Mars, including surface and transit.

This latter concept has been referred to as bioregenerative life support. To do this will require controlled environments for growing the crops, perhaps using techniques similar to recirculating hydroponics used on Earth. But this will require careful monitoring of the environment and the plants themselves to assess their health and performance. In addition, crew time will likely be limited in many space settings, so having the monitoring systems operate autonomously or with little human intervention would be beneficial.This subtopic solicits advanced technologies for remotely sensing the status of plants in controlled environments of space. These environments are typically small in volume, often use narrow band lighting from light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and are subject to reduced gravity. Example methods might include multispectral and hyperspectral sensing of crops, use of bio-indicators in the crops themselves, or other innovative, noninvasive means.

Focus Area 8 In-Situ Resource Utilization,Z12.01Extraction of Oxygen and Water from Lunar Regolith, JSC," GRC, JPL, KSC, MSFC", 2021,Solar Concentrator Technologies for Oxygen Extraction and In Situ Construction,"Solar concentrators have been used to successfully demonstrate multiple in situ resource utilization (ISRU) technologies, including hydrogen and carbothermal reduction, sintering of regolith to produce launch/landing pads, and production of blocks for construction. Terrestrial state-of-the-art solar concentrators are heavy, not designed for easy packaging/shipping and assembly/installation, and can be maintained and cleaned on a periodic basis to maintain performance. For ISRU space applications, NASA is interested in solar concentrators that are able to be packaged into small volumes, are lightweight, easily deployed and set up, can autonomously track the Sun, and can perform self-cleaning operations to remove accumulated dust. Materials, components, and systems that would be necessary for the proposed technology must be able to operate on the lunar surface in temperatures of up to 110 oC (230 oF) during sunlit periods and as as low as -170 oC (-274 oF) during periods of darkness. Systems must also be able to operate for at least 1 year with a goal of 5 years without substantial maintenance in the dusty regolith environment. Proposers should assume that regolith mining operations will be tens of meters away from the solar concentrators, but that regolith processing systems and solar concentrators will be co-located on a single lander. Phase I efforts can be demonstrated at any scale; Phase II efforts must be scalable up to 11.1 kW of delivered solar energy, assuming an incoming solar flux of ~1,350 W/m2 while also considering volumetric constraints for launch and landing. Each of the following specific areas of technology interest may be developed as a standalone technology.Lightweight mirrors/lenses: Proposals must clearly state the estimated W/kg for the proposed technology. Phase II deliverables must be deployed and supported in Earth 1g (without wind loads) but should include design recommendations for mass reductions for lunar gravity (1/6g) deployment. Proposals should address the following attributes: high reflectivity, low coefficient of thermal expansion, strength, mass, reliability, and cost. Efficient transmission of energy for oxygen/metal extraction: While the solar concentrator will need to move to track the Sun, reactors requiring direct thermal energy for oxygen extraction will be in a fixed position and orientation. Concentrated sunlight must be directed to a single or multiple spots to effectively heat or melt the regolith. Proposals must define the expected transition losses from collection to delivery and should capture any assumptions made regarding the distance from collection to delivery. Sintering end effector: Solar concentrators have been used to demonstrate the fabrication of 3D printed components using regolith as the only feedstock. Proposals responding to this specific technology area must produce and maintain a focal point temperature between 1,000 and 1,100 oC for the purpose of sintering lunar regolith. Proposals should assume that the focal point can move along the regolith at a speed between 1 and 10 mm/sec.",4 to 5,"Level 1: TX 07 Exploration Destination Systems

The performance of the system is captured in the 2011 paper ""Solar Thermal System for Lunar ISRU Applications: Development and Field Operation at Mauna Kea, HI"" [Ref. 6].","NASA Strategic Knowledge Gap (SKG) 1-F, ""Determine the likely efficiency of ISRU processes using lunar simulants in relevant environments,"" as well as NASA SKG 1-G, ""Measure the actual efficiency of ISRU processes in the lunar environment,"" are both important for the development of future ISRU systems. There are multiple ISRU processes that involve the use of solar concentrators, and determining their efficiency through technology development efforts may address NASA SKGs.","

Focus Area 8 In-Situ Resource Utilization,Z12.01Extraction of Oxygen and Water from Lunar Regolith, JSC," GRC, JPL, KSC, MSFC", 2021,Solar Concentrator Technologies for Oxygen Extraction and In Situ Construction,"Solar concentrators have been used to successfully demonstrate multiple in situ resource utilization (ISRU) technologies, including hydrogen and carbothermal reduction, sintering of regolith to produce launch/landing pads, and production of blocks for construction. Terrestrial state-of-the-art solar concentrators are heavy, not designed for easy packaging/shipping and assembly/installation, and can be maintained and cleaned on a periodic basis to maintain performance. For ISRU space applications, NASA is interested in solar concentrators that are able to be packaged into small volumes, are lightweight, easily deployed and set up, can autonomously track the Sun, and can perform self-cleaning operations to remove accumulated dust. Materials, components, and systems that would be necessary for the proposed technology must be able to operate on the lunar surface in temperatures of up to 110 oC (230 oF) during sunlit periods and as as low as -170 oC (-274 oF) during periods of darkness. Systems must also be able to operate for at least 1 year with a goal of 5 years without substantial maintenance in the dusty regolith environment. Proposers should assume that regolith mining operations will be tens of meters away from the solar concentrators, but that regolith processing systems and solar concentrators will be co-located on a single lander. Phase I efforts can be demonstrated at any scale; Phase II efforts must be scalable up to 11.1 kW of delivered solar energy, assuming an incoming solar flux of ~1,350 W/m2 while also considering volumetric constraints for launch and landing. Each of the following specific areas of technology interest may be developed as a standalone technology.Lightweight mirrors/lenses: Proposals must clearly state the estimated W/kg for the proposed technology. Phase II deliverables must be deployed and supported in Earth 1g (without wind loads) but should include design recommendations for mass reductions for lunar gravity (1/6g) deployment. Proposals should address the following attributes: high reflectivity, low coefficient of thermal expansion, strength, mass, reliability, and cost. Efficient transmission of energy for oxygen/metal extraction: While the solar concentrator will need to move to track the Sun, reactors requiring direct thermal energy for oxygen extraction will be in a fixed position and orientation. Concentrated sunlight must be directed to a single or multiple spots to effectively heat or melt the regolith. Proposals must define the expected transition losses from collection to delivery and should capture any assumptions made regarding the distance from collection to delivery. Sintering end effector: Solar concentrators have been used to demonstrate the fabrication of 3D printed components using regolith as the only feedstock. Proposals responding to this specific technology area must produce and maintain a focal point temperature between 1,000 and 1,100 oC for the purpose of sintering lunar regolith. Proposals should assume that the focal point can move along the regolith at a speed between 1 and 10 mm/sec.",4 to 5,"Level 1: TX 07 Exploration Destination Systems

Analysis
Hardware",Phase I deliverables may be a conceptual design with analysis to show feasibility at relevant scales and/or a small demonstration of the concept. Phase II deliverables should be hardware demonstrations at a relevant scale. See Scope Description for additional information on Phase I and Phase II deliverables.,"The 2011 paper ""Thermal Energy for Lunar In Situ Resource Utilization: Technical Challenges and Technology Opportunities"" [Ref. 1] summarized the work performed in this area and recommends future efforts focus on lightweight mirrors (possibly using composite materials) and dust mitigation techniques (dust mitigation is addressed in another subtopic).The last solar concentrator system developed for ISRU had an overall efficiency of ~33%. The performance of the system is captured in the 2011 paper ""Solar Thermal System for Lunar ISRU Applications: Development and Field Operation at Mauna Kea, HI"" [Ref. 6].","NASA Strategic Knowledge Gap (SKG) 1-F, ""Determine the likely efficiency of ISRU processes using lunar simulants in relevant environments,"" as well as NASA SKG 1-G, ""Measure the actual efficiency of ISRU processes in the lunar environment,"" are both important for the development of future ISRU systems. There are multiple ISRU processes that involve the use of solar concentrators, and determining their efficiency through technology development efforts may address NASA SKGs.","

Focus Area 10 Advanced Telescope Technologies,S2.05Technology for the Precision Radial Velocity Measurement Technique, JPL, GSFC, 2021,"Components, Assemblies, and Subsystems for Extreme Precision Radial Velocity Measurements and Detection of Extrasolar Planets","Astronomical spectrographs have proven to be powerful tools for exoplanet searches. When a star experiences periodic motion due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet, its spectrum is Doppler modulated in time. This is the basis for the precision radial velocity (PRV) method, one of the first and most efficient techniques for detecting and characterizing exoplanets. Because spectrographs have their own drifts, which must be separated from the periodic Doppler shift, a stable reference is always needed for calibration. Optical frequency combs (OFCs) and line-referenced etalons are capable of providing the spectral rulers needed for PRV detection of exoplanets. Although “stellar jitter” (a star’s photospheric velocity contribution to the RV signal) is unavoidable, the contribution to the error budget from Earth’s atmosphere would be eliminated in future space missions. Thus, there is a need to develop robust spectral references, especially at visible wavelengths to detect and characterize Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of their Sun-like host stars, with size, weight, and power (SWaP) suitable for space-qualified operation to calibrate the next generation of high-resolution spectrographs with precision corresponding to <~1 cm/s over multiple years of observations.This subtopic solicits proposals to develop cost-effective component and subsystem technology for low-SWaP, long-lived, robust implementation of RV measurement instruments both on the ground and in space. Research areas of interest include but are not limited to:Integrated photonic spectrographs. Spectrograph gratings. PRV spectrograph calibration sources. High efficiency photonic lanterns. Advanced optical fiber delivery systems and subsystems with high levels of image scrambling and modal noise reduction.

Phase I deliverables include feasibility and concept-of-operations of the research topic, simulations and measurements, validation of the proposed approach to develop a given product (TRL 3 to 4), and a plan for further development of the specific capabilities or products to be performed in Phase II. Early development and delivery of prototype hardware/software is encouraged. Phase II will emphasize hardware/software development with delivery of specific hardware or software products for NASA targeting demonstration operations at a ground-based telescope in coordination with the lead NASA center. Phase II deliverables include a working prototype or engineering model of the proposed product/platform or software along with documentation of development, capabilities, and measurements (showing specific improvement metrics); and tools as necessary. Proposed prototypes shall demonstrate a path towards a flight-capable platform. Opportunities and plans should also be identified and summarized for potential commercialization or NASA infusion.","High-resolving-power spectrographs (R ~ 150,000) with simultaneous UV, visible, and NIR coverage and exquisite long-term stability are required for PRV studies. Classical bulk optic spectrographs traditionally used for PRV science impose architectural constraints due to their large mass and limited optical flexibility. Integrated photonic spectrographs are wafer-thin devices that could reduce instrument volume by up to 3 orders of magnitude. Spectrometers that are fiber fed, with high illumination stability, excellent wavelength calibration, and precise temperature and pressure control represent the immediate future of precision RV measurements.Traditional RV spectrographs would benefit from improvements in grating technology. Diffraction-limited PRV spectrographs require echelle gratings with low wavefront error and high efficiency, both of which are very challenging to achieve. Echelle spectrographs are designed to operate at high angle-of-incidence and very high diffraction order. Hence, the grating must have very accurate groove placement (for low wavefront error) and very flat groove facets (for high efficiency). For decades, echelle gratings have been fabricated by diamond ruling, but it is difficult to achieve all aspects of the performance required for PRV instruments. Newer grating fabrication techniques using lithographic methods to form the grooves may be a promising approach. As spectrograph stability imposes limits on how precisely RV can be measured, spectral references play a critical role in characterizing and ensuring this precision. Only laser frequency combs (LFCs) and line-referenced Fabry-Pérot etalons are capable of providing the broad spectral coverage and long-term stability needed for extreme PRV detection of exoplanets. Although both frequency combs and etalons can deliver high-precision spectrograph calibration, the former requires relatively complex hardware in the visible portion of the spectrum.Commercial fiber laser astrocombs covering 450 to 1400 nm at 25 GHz line spacing and <3-dB intensity variations over the entire bandwidth are available for ground-based astronomical spectrographs. However, the cost for these systems is often so prohibitive that recent RV spectrograph projects either do not use a LFC or include it only as a future upgrade. Alternatively, astrocombs produced by electro-optic modulation (EOM) of a laser source have been demonstrated in the NIR. EOM combs produce modes spaced at a radiofrequency (RF) modulation frequency, typically 10 to 30 GHz. Significantly, EOM combs avoid the line filtering step required by commercial mode-locked fiber laser combs. Comb frequency stabilization can be accomplished by referencing the laser pump source to a molecular absorption feature or another frequency comb. Where octave spanning EOM combs are available, f-2f self-referencing provides the greatest stability. EOM combs must be spectrally broadened to provide the bandwidth necessary for PRV applications. This is accomplished through pulse amplification followed by injection into highly nonlinear fiber or nonlinear optical waveguides.Power consumption of the frequency comb calibration system will be a significant driver of mission cost for space-based PRV systems and motivates the development of a comb system that operates with less than 20 W of spacecraft power. Thus, for flight applications, it is highly desirable to develop frequency comb technology with low power consumption; ~10 to 30 GHz mode spacing; compact size; broad (octave spanning) spectral grasp across both the visible and NIR; low phase noise; stability traceable to the International System of Units definition of the second; and importantly, long life.The intrinsic illumination stability of the spectrometer also sets a fundamental measurement floor. As the image of the star varies at the entrance to the spectrometer because of atmospheric effects and telescope guiding errors, so too does the recorded stellar spectrum, leading to a spurious RV offset. Current seeing-limited PRV instruments use multimode optical fibers, which provide some degree of azimuthal image scrambling, to efficiently deliver stellar light from the telescope focal plane to the spectrometer input. Novel-core-geometry fibers, in concert with dedicated optical double-scramblers, are often used to further homogenize and stabilize the telescope illumination pattern in both the image and pupil planes. However, these systems still demonstrate measurable sensitivity to incident illumination variations from the telescope and atmosphere. Furthermore, as spectral resolution requirements increase, the commensurate increase in instrument size becomes impractical. Thus, the community has turned to implementing image and pupil slicers to reformat the near or far fields of light entering the spectrometer by preferentially redistributing starlight exiting the fiber to maintain high spectral resolution, efficiency, and compact spectrometer size.","The NASA Strategic Plan (2018) and Space Mission Directorate Science Plan (2014) both call for discovery and characterization of habitable Earth analogs and the search for biosignatures on those worlds. These goals were endorsed and amplified upon in the recent National Academy of Science (NAS) Exoplanet Report, which emphasized that a knowledge of the orbits and masses is essential to the complete and correct characterization of potentially habitable worlds. PRV measurements are needed to follow up on the transiting worlds discovered by Kepler, K2, and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The interpretation of the transit spectra that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will obtain will depend on knowledge of a planet’s surface gravity, which comes from its radius (from the transit data) and its mass (from PRV measurements or, in some cases, transit timing variations). Without knowledge of a planet's mass, the interpretation of its spectrum is subject to many ambiguities. These ambiguities will only be exacerbated for the direct-imaging missions such as the proposed Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) and Large Ultraviolet Optical Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) flagships, which will obtain spectra of Earth analogs around a few tens to hundreds of stars. Even if a radius can be inferred from the planet's brightness and an estimate of its albedo, the lack of a dynamical mass precludes any knowledge of the planet's density, bulk composition, and surface gravity, which are needed to determine, for example, absolute gas column densities. Moreover, a fully characterized orbit is challenging to determine from just a few direct images and may even be confused in the presence of multiple planets. Is a planet in a highly eccentric orbit habitable or not? Only dynamical (PRV) measurements can provide such information. Thus, highly precise and highly stable PRV measurements are absolutely critical to the complete characterization of habitable worlds. The NAS report also noted that measurements from space might be a final option if the problem of telluric contamination cannot be solved. The Earth’s atmosphere will limit precise radial velocity measurements to ~10 cm/s at wavelengths longer than ~700 nm and greater than 30 cm/s at wavelengths >900 nm, making it challenging to mitigate the effects of stellar activity without a measurement of the color dependence due to stellar activity in the PRV time series. A space-based PRV mission, such as has been suggested in the NASA EarthFinder mission concept study, may be necessary. If so, the low SWaP technologies developed under this SBIR program could help enable space-based implementations of the PRV method.","

Optical frequency combs (OFCs) and line-referenced etalons are capable of providing the spectral rulers needed for PRV detection of exoplanets. Although “stellar jitter” (a star’s photospheric velocity contribution to the RV signal) is unavoidable, the contribution to the error budget from Earth’s atmosphere would be eliminated in future space missions. Thus, there is a need to develop robust spectral references, especially at visible wavelengths to detect and characterize Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of their Sun-like host stars, with size, weight, and power (SWaP) suitable for space-qualified operation to calibrate the next generation of high-resolution spectrographs with precision corresponding to <~1 cm/s over multiple years of observations.This subtopic solicits proposals to develop cost-effective component and subsystem technology for low-SWaP, long-lived, robust implementation of RV measurement instruments both on the ground and in space.

Classical bulk optic spectrographs traditionally used for PRV science impose architectural constraints due to their large mass and limited optical flexibility. Integrated photonic spectrographs are wafer-thin devices that could reduce instrument volume by up to 3 orders of magnitude. Spectrometers that are fiber fed, with high illumination stability, excellent wavelength calibration, and precise temperature and pressure control represent the immediate future of precision RV measurements.Traditional RV spectrographs would benefit from improvements in grating technology. Diffraction-limited PRV spectrographs require echelle gratings with low wavefront error and high efficiency, both of which are very challenging to achieve. Echelle spectrographs are designed to operate at high angle-of-incidence and very high diffraction order. Hence, the grating must have very accurate groove placement (for low wavefront error) and very flat groove facets (for high efficiency). For decades, echelle gratings have been fabricated by diamond ruling, but it is difficult to achieve all aspects of the performance required for PRV instruments. Newer grating fabrication techniques using lithographic methods to form the grooves may be a promising approach. As spectrograph stability imposes limits on how precisely RV can be measured, spectral references play a critical role in characterizing and ensuring this precision. Only laser frequency combs (LFCs) and line-referenced Fabry-Pérot etalons are capable of providing the broad spectral coverage and long-term stability needed for extreme PRV detection of exoplanets. Although both frequency combs and etalons can deliver high-precision spectrograph calibration, the former requires relatively complex hardware in the visible portion of the spectrum.Commercial fiber laser astrocombs covering 450 to 1400 nm at 25 GHz line spacing and <3-dB intensity variations over the entire bandwidth are available for ground-based astronomical spectrographs. However, the cost for these systems is often so prohibitive that recent RV spectrograph projects either do not use a LFC or include it only as a future upgrade. Alternatively, astrocombs produced by electro-optic modulation (EOM) of a laser source have been demonstrated in the NIR. EOM combs produce modes spaced at a radiofrequency (RF) modulation frequency, typically 10 to 30 GHz. Significantly, EOM combs avoid the line filtering step required by commercial mode-locked fiber laser combs. Comb frequency stabilization can be accomplished by referencing the laser pump source to a molecular absorption feature or another frequency comb. Where octave spanning EOM combs are available, f-2f self-referencing provides the greatest stability. EOM combs must be spectrally broadened to provide the bandwidth necessary for PRV applications. This is accomplished through pulse amplification followed by injection into highly nonlinear fiber or nonlinear optical waveguides.Power consumption of the frequency comb calibration system will be a significant driver of mission cost for space-based PRV systems and motivates the development of a comb system that operates with less than 20 W of spacecraft power. Thus, for flight applications, it is highly desirable to develop frequency comb technology with low power consumption; ~10 to 30 GHz mode spacing; compact size; broad (octave spanning) spectral grasp across both the visible and NIR; low phase noise; stability traceable to the International System of Units definition of the second; and importantly, long life.The intrinsic illumination stability of the spectrometer also sets a fundamental measurement floor. As the image of the star varies at the entrance to the spectrometer because of atmospheric effects and telescope guiding errors, so too does the recorded stellar spectrum, leading to a spurious RV offset. Current seeing-limited PRV instruments use multimode optical fibers, which provide some degree of azimuthal image scrambling, to efficiently deliver stellar light from the telescope focal plane to the spectrometer input. Novel-core-geometry fibers, in concert with dedicated optical double-scramblers, are often used to further homogenize and stabilize the telescope illumination pattern in both the image and pupil planes. However, these systems still demonstrate measurable sensitivity to incident illumination variations from the telescope and atmosphere. Furthermore, as spectral resolution requirements increase, the commensurate increase in instrument size becomes impractical. Thus, the community has turned to implementing image and pupil slicers to reformat the near or far fields of light entering the spectrometer by preferentially redistributing starlight exiting the fiber to maintain high spectral resolution, efficiency, and compact spectrometer size.","The NASA Strategic Plan (2018) and Space Mission Directorate Science Plan (2014) both call for discovery and characterization of habitable Earth analogs and the search for biosignatures on those worlds. These goals were endorsed and amplified upon in the recent National Academy of Science (NAS) Exoplanet Report, which emphasized that a knowledge of the orbits and masses is essential to the complete and correct characterization of potentially habitable worlds. PRV measurements are needed to follow up on the transiting worlds discovered by Kepler, K2, and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The interpretation of the transit spectra that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will obtain will depend on knowledge of a planet’s surface gravity, which comes from its radius (from the transit data) and its mass (from PRV measurements or, in some cases, transit timing variations). Without knowledge of a planet's mass, the interpretation of its spectrum is subject to many ambiguities. These ambiguities will only be exacerbated for the direct-imaging missions such as the proposed Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) and Large Ultraviolet Optical Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) flagships, which will obtain spectra of Earth analogs around a few tens to hundreds of stars. Even if a radius can be inferred from the planet's brightness and an estimate of its albedo, the lack of a dynamical mass precludes any knowledge of the planet's density, bulk composition, and surface gravity, which are needed to determine, for example, absolute gas column densities. Moreover, a fully characterized orbit is challenging to determine from just a few direct images and may even be confused in the presence of multiple planets. Is a planet in a highly eccentric orbit habitable or not? Only dynamical (PRV) measurements can provide such information. Thus, highly precise and highly stable PRV measurements are absolutely critical to the complete characterization of habitable worlds. The NAS report also noted that measurements from space might be a final option if the problem of telluric contamination cannot be solved. The Earth’s atmosphere will limit precise radial velocity measurements to ~10 cm/s at wavelengths longer than ~700 nm and greater than 30 cm/s at wavelengths >900 nm, making it challenging to mitigate the effects of stellar activity without a measurement of the color dependence due to stellar activity in the PRV time series. A space-based PRV mission, such as has been suggested in the NASA EarthFinder mission concept study, may be necessary. If so, the low SWaP technologies developed under this SBIR program could help enable space-based implementations of the PRV method.","

Even if a radius can be inferred from the planet's brightness and an estimate of its albedo, the lack of a dynamical mass precludes any knowledge of the planet's density, bulk composition, and surface gravity, which are needed to determine, for example, absolute gas column densities. Moreover, a fully characterized orbit is challenging to determine from just a few direct images and may even be confused in the presence of multiple planets. Is a planet in a highly eccentric orbit habitable or not? Only dynamical (PRV) measurements can provide such information. Thus, highly precise and highly stable PRV measurements are absolutely critical to the complete characterization of habitable worlds. The NAS report also noted that measurements from space might be a final option if the problem of telluric contamination cannot be solved. The Earth’s atmosphere will limit precise radial velocity measurements to ~10 cm/s at wavelengths longer than ~700 nm and greater than 30 cm/s at wavelengths >900 nm, making it challenging to mitigate the effects of stellar activity without a measurement of the color dependence due to stellar activity in the PRV time series. A space-based PRV mission, such as has been suggested in the NASA EarthFinder mission concept study, may be necessary. If so, the low SWaP technologies developed under this SBIR program could help enable space-based implementations of the PRV method.","

Focus Area 10 Advanced Telescope Technologies,S2.05Technology for the Precision Radial Velocity Measurement Technique, JPL, GSFC, 2021,"Components, Assemblies, and Subsystems for Extreme Precision Radial Velocity Measurements and Detection of Extrasolar Planets","Astronomical spectrographs have proven to be powerful tools for exoplanet searches. When a star experiences periodic motion due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet, its spectrum is Doppler modulated in time. This is the basis for the precision radial velocity (PRV) method, one of the first and most efficient techniques for detecting and characterizing exoplanets. Because spectrographs have their own drifts, which must be separated from the periodic Doppler shift, a stable reference is always needed for calibration. Optical frequency combs (OFCs) and line-referenced etalons are capable of providing the spectral rulers needed for PRV detection of exoplanets. Although “stellar jitter” (a star’s photospheric velocity contribution to the RV signal) is unavoidable, the contribution to the error budget from Earth’s atmosphere would be eliminated in future space missions. Thus, there is a need to develop robust spectral references, especially at visible wavelengths to detect and characterize Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of their Sun-like host stars, with size, weight, and power (SWaP) suitable for space-qualified operation to calibrate the next generation of high-resolution spectrographs with precision corresponding to <~1 cm/s over multiple years of observations.This subtopic solicits proposals to develop cost-effective component and subsystem technology for low-SWaP, long-lived, robust implementation of RV measurement instruments both on the ground and in space. Research areas of interest include but are not limited to:Integrated photonic spectrographs. Spectrograph gratings. PRV spectrograph calibration sources. High efficiency photonic lanterns. Advanced optical fiber delivery systems and subsystems with high levels of image scrambling and modal noise reduction. Software for advanced statistical techniques to mitigate effects of telluric absorption and stellar jitter on RV precision and accuracy.",3 to 5,"Level 1: TX 08 Sensors and Instruments
Level 2: TX 08.2 Observatories","Hardware
Software","Phase I will emphasize research aspects for technical feasibility, infusion potential into ground or space operations, clear and achievable benefits (e.g., reduction in SWaP and/or cost, improved RV precision), and show a path towards a Phase II proposal. Phase I deliverables include feasibility and concept-of-operations of the research topic, simulations and measurements, validation of the proposed approach to develop a given product (TRL 3 to 4), and a plan for further development of the specific capabilities or products to be performed in Phase II. Early development and delivery of prototype hardware/software is encouraged. Phase II will emphasize hardware/software development with delivery of specific hardware or software products for NASA targeting demonstration operations at a ground-based telescope in coordination with the lead NASA center. Phase II deliverables include a working prototype or engineering model of the proposed product/platform or software along with documentation of development, capabilities, and measurements (showing specific improvement metrics); and tools as necessary. Proposed prototypes shall demonstrate a path towards a flight-capable platform. Opportunities and plans should also be identified and summarized for potential commercialization or NASA infusion.","High-resolving-power spectrographs (R ~ 150,000) with simultaneous UV, visible, and NIR coverage and exquisite long-term stability are required for PRV studies. Classical bulk optic spectrographs traditionally used for PRV science impose architectural constraints due to their large mass and limited optical flexibility. Integrated photonic spectrographs are wafer-thin devices that could reduce instrument volume by up to 3 orders of magnitude. Spectrometers that are fiber fed, with high illumination stability, excellent wavelength calibration, and precise temperature and pressure control represent the immediate future of precision RV measurements.Traditional RV spectrographs would benefit from improvements in grating technology. Diffraction-limited PRV spectrographs require echelle gratings with low wavefront error and high efficiency, both of which are very challenging to achieve. Echelle spectrographs are designed to operate at high angle-of-incidence and very high diffraction order. Hence, the grating must have very accurate groove placement (for low wavefront error) and very flat groove facets (for high efficiency). For decades, echelle gratings have been fabricated by diamond ruling, but it is difficult to achieve all aspects of the performance required for PRV instruments. Newer grating fabrication techniques using lithographic methods to form the grooves may be a promising approach. As spectrograph stability imposes limits on how precisely RV can be measured, spectral references play a critical role in characterizing and ensuring this precision. Only laser frequency combs (LFCs) and line-referenced Fabry-Pérot etalons are capable of providing the broad spectral coverage and long-term stability needed for extreme PRV detection of exoplanets. Although both frequency combs and etalons can deliver high-precision spectrograph calibration, the former requires relatively complex hardware in the visible portion of the spectrum.Commercial fiber laser astrocombs covering 450 to 1400 nm at 25 GHz line spacing and <3-dB intensity variations over the entire bandwidth are available for ground-based astronomical spectrographs. However, the cost for these systems is often so prohibitive that recent RV spectrograph projects either do not use a LFC or include it only as a future upgrade. Alternatively, astrocombs produced by electro-optic modulation (EOM) of a laser source have been demonstrated in the NIR. EOM combs produce modes spaced at a radiofrequency (RF) modulation frequency, typically 10 to 30 GHz. Significantly, EOM combs avoid the line filtering step required by commercial mode-locked fiber laser combs. Comb frequency stabilization can be accomplished by referencing the laser pump source to a molecular absorption feature or another frequency comb. Where octave spanning EOM combs are available, f-2f self-referencing provides the greatest stability. EOM combs must be spectrally broadened to provide the bandwidth necessary for PRV applications. This is accomplished through pulse amplification followed by injection into highly nonlinear fiber or nonlinear optical waveguides.Power consumption of the frequency comb calibration system will be a significant driver of mission cost for space-based PRV systems and motivates the development of a comb system that operates with less than 20 W of spacecraft power. Thus, for flight applications, it is highly desirable to develop frequency comb technology with low power consumption; ~10 to 30 GHz mode spacing; compact size; broad (octave spanning) spectral grasp across both the visible and NIR; low phase noise; stability traceable to the International System of Units definition of the second; and importantly, long life.The intrinsic illumination stability of the spectrometer also sets a fundamental measurement floor. As the image of the star varies at the entrance to the spectrometer because of atmospheric effects and telescope guiding errors, so too does the recorded stellar spectrum, leading to a spurious RV offset. Current seeing-limited PRV instruments use multimode optical fibers, which provide some degree of azimuthal image scrambling, to efficiently deliver stellar light from the telescope focal plane to the spectrometer input. Novel-core-geometry fibers, in concert with dedicated optical double-scramblers, are often used to further homogenize and stabilize the telescope illumination pattern in both the image and pupil planes. However, these systems still demonstrate measurable sensitivity to incident illumination variations from the telescope and atmosphere. Furthermore, as spectral resolution requirements increase, the commensurate increase in instrument size becomes impractical. Thus, the community has turned to implementing image and pupil slicers to reformat the near or far fields of light entering the spectrometer by preferentially redistributing starlight exiting the fiber to maintain high spectral resolution, efficiency, and compact spectrometer size.","The NASA Strategic Plan (2018) and Space Mission Directorate Science Plan (2014) both call for discovery and characterization of habitable Earth analogs and the search for biosignatures on those worlds. These goals were endorsed and amplified upon in the recent National Academy of Science (NAS) Exoplanet Report, which emphasized that a knowledge of the orbits and masses is essential to the complete and correct characterization of potentially habitable worlds. PRV measurements are needed to follow up on the transiting worlds discovered by Kepler, K2, and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The interpretation of the transit spectra that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will obtain will depend on knowledge of a planet’s surface gravity, which comes from its radius (from the transit data) and its mass (from PRV measurements or, in some cases, transit timing variations). Without knowledge of a planet's mass, the interpretation of its spectrum is subject to many ambiguities. These ambiguities will only be exacerbated for the direct-imaging missions such as the proposed Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) and Large Ultraviolet Optical Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) flagships, which will obtain spectra of Earth analogs around a few tens to hundreds of stars. Even if a radius can be inferred from the planet's brightness and an estimate of its albedo, the lack of a dynamical mass precludes any knowledge of the planet's density, bulk composition, and surface gravity, which are needed to determine, for example, absolute gas column densities. Moreover, a fully characterized orbit is challenging to determine from just a few direct images and may even be confused in the presence of multiple planets. Is a planet in a highly eccentric orbit habitable or not? Only dynamical (PRV) measurements can provide such information. Thus, highly precise and highly stable PRV measurements are absolutely critical to the complete characterization of habitable worlds. The NAS report also noted that measurements from space might be a final option if the problem of telluric contamination cannot be solved. The Earth’s atmosphere will limit precise radial velocity measurements to ~10 cm/s at wavelengths longer than ~700 nm and greater than 30 cm/s at wavelengths >900 nm, making it challenging to mitigate the effects of stellar activity without a measurement of the color dependence due to stellar activity in the PRV time series.

If so, the low SWaP technologies developed under this SBIR program could help enable space-based implementations of the PRV method.","

Future exploration missions will utilize new ablative TPS materials that release decomposition products into the gas stream ahead of the vehicle, influencing flow-field behavior. Data and observations from materials testing programs using NASA’s arc jet facilities are critical for validation of high-fidelity modeling and simulation tools used to design and margin TPS specifications for entry vehicles. However, the complex multiphysics processes that manifest as entry aeroheating of ablative TPSs present formidable challenges for model validation. The available diagnostic techniques for arc jet testing provide little direct evidence of the subject aerothermal and thermophysical processes.NASA is seeking advanced and new optical and laser-spectroscopic techniques applied to arc jet testing programs. Experimental methods for arc jet facility characterization strive to quantify thermodynamic and gas dynamic properties of the arc jet stream and serve multiple purposes, such as verification of test conditions (facility operations), validation of arc heater and flow-field simulations, and measurement of incident/boundary conditions for material response simulations. Of equal importance are methods that can detect and identify pyrolysis gases and particles injected into the shocked gas region ahead of TPS material test articles, providing needed insight to the complex interactions of the flow field with material response. Experimental methods that measure recession, temperature, and optical properties of the TPS surface enable characterization of surface thermal response phenomenology.The off-body gas phase diagnostics are to detect and quantify:Major species in the arc jet stream (N, O, N2, NO for air; CO and CO2 for facilities capable of operating with CO2 mixtures). Ablation species and recombination products in the shock layer (C, CN, CH, H, Ca). Spalled particles from test articles penetrating the shock layer.Also of importance are measurements of velocity and free stream and shock layer temperatures, including vibrational temperature. Planar or line imaging techniques are desired to characterize spatial distributions with 1-mm or smaller resolution at kHz data rates. Burst mode (>100 kHz) imaging approaches that enable correlation of temporal-spatial intermittencies are of particular interest.The requested surface imaging diagnostics are to measure test-article temperature and spectral emissivity, topology, and recession rate. Hyperspectral techniques are preferred if they enable characterization of multiple surface properties simultaneously while discriminating from shock layer radiation. Spatial resolutions and acquisition rates of <1 mm and >30 Hz, respectively, are desired. Adaptation of standoff surface spectroscopy techniques may hold promise for time-resolved species detection and identification.Spallation characterization requires measurements of ejected particle size distributions, 2D and 3D trajectories, and velocity distributions. Techniques for both stagnation and shear testing configurations are desired. Imaging spatial resolution and field of view needs to account for particle trajectories that travel upstream and penetrate shock waves. Methods that provide insight to the chemical composition of spalled particles would be particularly valuable.

Hardware",Phase I: Assessment study of potential diagnostic techniques. Phase II: Prototype instrument demonstration in relevant environment with hardware delivery to NASA.,"The requirements for spatially resolved, species-specific measurements of high-temperature-reacting gas properties necessitate the use of optical-spectroscopic methods. The state of the art at NASA’s arc-heated facilities are techniques based on nanosecond-pulsed laser-induced fluorescence (ns-LIF). Pointwise flow property measurement requires approximately 60 to 90 sec per acquisition to recover properties calibrated to engineering units (velocity, temperature, species densities) at one location. The low sensitivity and long standoff distances in arc-heated facilities preclude line or planar imaging. The long acquisition times result in a poor use of expensive testing resources. The ns-LIF approach is not suitable for post-shock and near-surface regions, as the moderate pressures, high temperatures, and strong gas and surface luminosity confound signal interpretation, effectively prohibiting quantitative ablation species detection. Emission spectroscopy techniques for free-stream and shock-layer measurements have been used with success for many years, but these are limited to observation of excited-state populations along integrated lines of sight. Tunable laser absorption spectroscopy can target ground-state or excited-state populations of certain species of interest; however, the low-density/high-temperature test conditions and the short path lengths yield absorbances too low for detection with demonstrated laser absorption techniques.Recent advances in tunable amplified sources pumped by kHz and burst-mode femtosecond-pulse lasers has enabled the development of several nonlinear laser spectroscopy techniques. These new techniques have capabilities that directly address the sensitivity, temporal, and spatial resolution shortcomings identified above.For spallation diagnostics, both active interrogation/response and passive imaging techniques have potential for characterizing size distributions, trajectories, and velocity distributions. NASA’s current capability for observing and quantifying spallation is the use of high-speed gated video, which is limited to situations where particle luminosity can be distinguished from background sources.","Several potential future missions, outlined in decadal surveys, crewed exploration mission studies, and other supporting analyses, have ED/EDL (entry and descent or entry, descent, and landing) architectures: Mars Sample Return, high-speed crewed return, high-mass Mars landers, Venus, and gas/ice giant probes. With few exceptions, entry vehicle TPS for these missions will be composed of materials currently under development and without certification heritage in multiple gases. Arc jet testing at conditions relevant for certification will invariably be required for each of these proposed missions. Ground testing at more extreme environments for future missions will challenge existing capabilities. There is a compelling need now to bring research-level diagnostic technologies forward to ensure that facility operations can confidently demonstrate required performance to TPS technology projects.Conventional instrumentation will continue to be the primary source of facility characterization data. The purposes of the advanced techniques are to provide validating evidence for the conventional instrumentation, reveal error and bias in interpretation of heat flux measurements, and ultimately reduce uncertainty in facility performance data provided to test programs.NASA planetary exploration programs supporting ED/EDL missions are the intended beneficiaries of this subtopic.

Focus Area 13 Information Technologies for Science Data,S5.06Space Weather Research-to-Operations/Operations-to-Research (R2O/O2R) Technology Development, GSFC," ARC, JPL, JSC, LaRC, MSFC", 2021,Space Weather Research-to-Operations/Operations-to-Research (R2O/O2R) Technology Development,"Space weather has the potential to disrupt telecommunications; aircraft and satellite systems; electric power subsystems; and position, navigation, and timing services. Given the importance of these systems to our national well-being, NASA’s Heliophysics Division invests in activities to improve the understanding of these phenomena and to enable new monitoring, prediction, and mitigation strategies. The national direction for this work is organized by the Space Weather Operations, Research, and Mitigation (SWORM) Working Group, which is a Federal interagency coordinating body organized under the Space Weather, Security, and Hazards (SWSH) Subcommittee. The SWSH is a part of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Committee on Homeland and National Security, organized under the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). The SWORM coordinates Federal Government departments and agencies to meet the goals and objectives specified in the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan released in March 2019. NASA’s role under the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan is to provide increased understanding of the fundamental physics of the Sun-Earth system through space-based observations and modeling, the development of new space-based space weather technologies and missions, and monitoring of space weather for NASA's space missions. This includes research that advances operational space weather needs. This subtopic solicits new, enabling space weather technologies as part of NASA’s response to these national objectives. While this subtopic will consider all concepts demonstrably related to NASA’s R2O/O2R responsibilities outlined in the Strategy and Action Plan, four areas have been identified for priority development:Space Weather Forecasting Technologies and Techniques: Innovative technologies and techniques are solicited that explore and enable the transition of tools, models, data, and knowledge from research to operational environments. This includes the preparation and validation of existing science models that may be suitable for transition to operational use. Consultation with existing NASA capabilities that prepare space weather forecasting products for later use—such as the Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG) at Johnson Space Center (JSC), the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), and the Short-term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) Center at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC)—may be appropriate. Areas of special interest include, but are not limited to:Lunar space environment characterization tools that can be employed by NASA to enhance protection of crewed and uncrewed missions to cis-lunar and lunar surface missions. Specifications and/or forecasts of the energetic particle and plasma conditions encountered by spacecraft within Earth’s magnetosphere, as well as products that directly aid in spacecraft anomaly resolution; and end-users such as spacecraft operators. Approaches that potentially lead to a 2- to 3-day forecasting of atmospheric drag effects on satellites and improvement in the quantification of orbital uncertainties in low-Earth-orbit (LEO) altitude ranges (up to ~2000 km). Techniques that enable the characterization and prediction of ionospheric variability that induces scintillations, which impact communication and global navigation and positioning systems. Longer range (2 to 3 days) forecasting of SPEs (solar particle events) and an improved all-clear SPE-forecasting capability.Space Weather Advanced Data-Driven Discovery Techniques: A particular challenge is to combine the sparse, vastly distributed data sources available with realistic models of the near-Earth space environment. Data assimilation and other cutting-edge data- driven discovery innovations are solicited that enable tools and protocols for the operational space weather community. Priority will be given to proposals that: Develop data assimilation space weather applications or technologies desired by established space weather operational organizations. Integrate data from assets that typically do not share similar time series, utilize different measurement techniques (e.g., imaging vs. in situ particles and fields), or are distributed throughout the heliosphere. Provide new data-driven operational forecasting tools that can be straightforwardly validated by the CCMC or another equally robust validation methodology. Integrate underutilized resources (e.g., space-based radio occultation for ionospheric specification or U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) ground conductivity measurements related to geomagnetically induced currents). Space Weather Mitigation Technologies: The 2019 National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan specifically calls out the need to test, evaluate, and deploy technologies and devices to mitigate the effects of space weather on communication systems, geomagnetic disturbances on the electrical power grid, or radiation events on satellites. Additionally, it identifies a need for robust situational awareness capabilities, driven by improved understanding and characterization of the effects space weather phenomena have on Earth and in the space environment, to inform decision making and enable the execution of missions susceptible to disruptions from space weather. It also includes the development of processes to improve the transition of research approaches to operations.Space Weather Instrumentation: Heliophysics science relies on a wide variety of instrumentation for its research and often makes its data available in near real time for space weather forecasting purposes. Concepts are solicited for instrumentation concepts, flight architectures, and reporting systems that enable enhanced, more informative, robust, and effective measurements for space weather monitoring and forecasting systems. Opportunities for improving measurements include increased spatial and temporal resolution, fidelity, promptness, and measurement system reliability. This includes the miniaturization of existing systems and/or technologies deployable as an array of CubeSats, as a hosted payload on satellite or other platform, or as a small complete mission making use of a rideshare opportunity.In order to be considered for investment, SBIR technologies should demonstrate comparable, or better, precision and accuracy when compared to the current state of the art. Further, SBIR instrument designs should avoid duplicating current NASA research spacecraft arrays or detector systems, including those currently in formulation or development (e.g., Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP), Geospace Dynamics Constellation (GDC), Medici, Explorer concepts, etc.).Proposals must demonstrate an understanding of the current state of the art, describe how the proposed innovation is superior, and provide a feasible plan to develop the technology and infuse it into a specific activity listed within the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan.",3 to 8,"Level 1: TX 11 Software, Modeling, Simulation, and Information Processing
Level 2: TX 11.X Other Software, Modeling, Simulation, and Information Processing","Prototype
Hardware
Software","Space weather is a broad umbrella encompassing science, engineering, applications, and operations. The ultimate goal of this SBIR subtopic is to generate products or services (“deliverables”) that enable end-user action. The deliverables can be applied, for example, to space weather hazard assessments, to real-time situational awareness, or to plan protective mitigation actions.

Given the importance of these systems to our national well-being, NASA’s Heliophysics Division invests in activities to improve the understanding of these phenomena and to enable new monitoring, prediction, and mitigation strategies. The national direction for this work is organized by the Space Weather Operations, Research, and Mitigation (SWORM) Working Group, which is a Federal interagency coordinating body organized under the Space Weather, Security, and Hazards (SWSH) Subcommittee. The SWSH is a part of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Committee on Homeland and National Security, organized under the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). The SWORM coordinates Federal Government departments and agencies to meet the goals and objectives specified in the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan released in March 2019. NASA’s role under the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan is to provide increased understanding of the fundamental physics of the Sun-Earth system through space-based observations and modeling, the development of new space-based space weather technologies and missions, and monitoring of space weather for NASA's space missions. This includes research that advances operational space weather needs. This subtopic solicits new, enabling space weather technologies as part of NASA’s response to these national objectives. While this subtopic will consider all concepts demonstrably related to NASA’s R2O/O2R responsibilities outlined in the Strategy and Action Plan, four areas have been identified for priority development:Space Weather Forecasting Technologies and Techniques: Innovative technologies and techniques are solicited that explore and enable the transition of tools, models, data, and knowledge from research to operational environments. This includes the preparation and validation of existing science models that may be suitable for transition to operational use. Consultation with existing NASA capabilities that prepare space weather forecasting products for later use—such as the Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG) at Johnson Space Center (JSC), the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), and the Short-term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) Center at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC)—may be appropriate. Areas of special interest include, but are not limited to:Lunar space environment characterization tools that can be employed by NASA to enhance protection of crewed and uncrewed missions to cis-lunar and lunar surface missions. Specifications and/or forecasts of the energetic particle and plasma conditions encountered by spacecraft within Earth’s magnetosphere, as well as products that directly aid in spacecraft anomaly resolution; and end-users such as spacecraft operators. Approaches that potentially lead to a 2- to 3-day forecasting of atmospheric drag effects on satellites and improvement in the quantification of orbital uncertainties in low-Earth-orbit (LEO) altitude ranges (up to ~2000 km). Techniques that enable the characterization and prediction of ionospheric variability that induces scintillations, which impact communication and global navigation and positioning systems. Longer range (2 to 3 days) forecasting of SPEs (solar particle events) and an improved all-clear SPE-forecasting capability.Space Weather Advanced Data-Driven Discovery Techniques: A particular challenge is to combine the sparse, vastly distributed data sources available with realistic models of the near-Earth space environment. Data assimilation and other cutting-edge data- driven discovery innovations are solicited that enable tools and protocols for the operational space weather community. Priority will be given to proposals that: Develop data assimilation space weather applications or technologies desired by established space weather operational organizations. Integrate data from assets that typically do not share similar time series, utilize different measurement techniques (e.g., imaging vs. in situ particles and fields), or are distributed throughout the heliosphere. Provide new data-driven operational forecasting tools that can be straightforwardly validated by the CCMC or another equally robust validation methodology. Integrate underutilized resources (e.g., space-based radio occultation for ionospheric specification or U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) ground conductivity measurements related to geomagnetically induced currents). Space Weather Mitigation Technologies: The 2019 National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan specifically calls out the need to test, evaluate, and deploy technologies and devices to mitigate the effects of space weather on communication systems, geomagnetic disturbances on the electrical power grid, or radiation events on satellites. Additionally, it identifies a need for robust situational awareness capabilities, driven by improved understanding and characterization of the effects space weather phenomena have on Earth and in the space environment, to inform decision making and enable the execution of missions susceptible to disruptions from space weather. It also includes the development of processes to improve the transition of research approaches to operations.Space Weather Instrumentation: Heliophysics science relies on a wide variety of instrumentation for its research and often makes its data available in near real time for space weather forecasting purposes. Concepts are solicited for instrumentation concepts, flight architectures, and reporting systems that enable enhanced, more informative, robust, and effective measurements for space weather monitoring and forecasting systems. Opportunities for improving measurements include increased spatial and temporal resolution, fidelity, promptness, and measurement system reliability. This includes the miniaturization of existing systems and/or technologies deployable as an array of CubeSats, as a hosted payload on satellite or other platform, or as a small complete mission making use of a rideshare opportunity.In order to be considered for investment, SBIR technologies should demonstrate comparable, or better, precision and accuracy when compared to the current state of the art. Further, SBIR instrument designs should avoid duplicating current NASA research spacecraft arrays or detector systems, including those currently in formulation or development (e.g., Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP), Geospace Dynamics Constellation (GDC), Medici, Explorer concepts, etc.).Proposals must demonstrate an understanding of the current state of the art, describe how the proposed innovation is superior, and provide a feasible plan to develop the technology and infuse it into a specific activity listed within the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan.",3 to 8,"Level 1: TX 11 Software, Modeling, Simulation, and Information Processing

Further, SBIR instrument designs should avoid duplicating current NASA research spacecraft arrays or detector systems, including those currently in formulation or development (e.g., Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP), Geospace Dynamics Constellation (GDC), Medici, Explorer concepts, etc.).Proposals must demonstrate an understanding of the current state of the art, describe how the proposed innovation is superior, and provide a feasible plan to develop the technology and infuse it into a specific activity listed within the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan.",3 to 8,"Level 1: TX 11 Software, Modeling, Simulation, and Information Processing

Software","Space weather is a broad umbrella encompassing science, engineering, applications, and operations. The ultimate goal of this SBIR subtopic is to generate products or services (“deliverables”) that enable end-user action. The deliverables can be applied, for example, to space weather hazard assessments, to real-time situational awareness, or to plan protective mitigation actions. Deliverables can be in the form of new data, new techniques, new instrumentation, and/or predictive models that are prepared/validated for transition into operations.Phase I deliverables are proof-of-concept data and/or detailed technique, instrument, or model development plans with sufficient fidelity to assess technical, management, cost, and schedule risk.Phase I deliverables should also delineate the scope and benefit of the proposed products that could be realized as a result of Phase II and what further scope and benefit necessarily requires further development after Phase II. Phase II deliverables are functioning prototype versions of the proposed technologies that have been tested in a realistic environment or within a standard space weather community development and validation framework. The extent of the prototype development and testing will vary with the technology and will be evaluated as part of the Phase II proposal.Phase II deliverables should also include delineate any further work that would be required to bring the technologies to full operational and commercial use.","We do not yet know how to predict what needs to be predicted, we do not yet know how quantitatively good/bad our operational capabilities are (metrics), mechanisms do not yet exist to enable a broad range of the community to participate in the improvement of operational models, and the research environment advances understanding rather than the improvement of operational products.Space weather poses a constant threat to the Nation’s critical infrastructure, our satellites in orbit, and our crewed and uncrewed space activities. Extreme space weather events can cause substantial harm to our Nation’s security and economic vitality.Preparing for space weather events is an important aspect of American resilience that bolsters national and homeland security and facilitates continued U.S. leadership in space. A robust space weather program and its associated forecasting capabilities are essential for NASA’s future exploration success.","This SBIR subtopic enables NASA to demonstrate progress against NASA Goal 1.4: Understand the Sun and its interactions with Earth and the solar system, including space weather.These applied research projects directly address NASA's role within the SWORM Working Group, which is a Federal interagency coordinating body organized under the SWSH Subcommittee. The SWSH is a part of the NSTC Committee on Homeland and National Security, organized under the OSTP. The SWORM coordinates Federal Government departments and agencies to meet the goals and objectives specified in the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan released in March 2019.The Heliophysics Space Weather Science and Applications (SWxSA) Program establishes an expanded role for NASA in space weather science under a single element. It is consistent with the recommendation of the National Research Council (NRC) Decadal Survey and the OSTP/SWORM 2019 National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan. It competes ideas and products, leverages existing agency capabilities, collaborates with other agencies, and fosters partnership with user communities. The SWxSA program is distinguishable from other heliophysics research elements in that it is specifically focused on investigations that significantly advance understanding of space weather and then apply this progress to enable more accurate characterization and predictions with longer lead time. The Heliophysics Living with a Star (LWS) Program has established a path forward to meet NASA’s obligations to the research relevant to space weather and is a significant source of input to SWxSA.Further involvement by the emerging Heliophysics space weather commercial community has the potential to significantly advance the space weather application obligations portion of the mandate.Astronauts are not protected by the Earth's atmosphere and are exposed to space radiation such as galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles. A robust space weather program and associated forecasting capabilities is essential for NASA's future exploration success.","

One of these challenges, especially relevant in the context of advanced tailorable composites, is a manufacturability assessment that could be leveraged as a design constraint early in the development. Absence of a reliable and comprehensive manufacturability assessment often restricts exploitation of the full potential of the composite material system and promotes conservative fabrication approaches that can negate potential mass benefits of composites. Suboptimal designs such as quasi-isotropic lamination stacking sequence treat the material as “black aluminum,” failing to permit tailored load paths possible with composites. Consequently, a material system that can enable large reductions in system mass ends up being used in the design process in a way that results in structural components that are much heavier than necessary.This solicitation seeks to advance the analytical predictive manufacturability assessment capabilities for layered composites. Such an assessment is required as a constraint in the structural design and optimization process. Layered pre-impregnated composite materials reinforced with either continuous or short fibers, and with a broad spectrum of ply thicknesses, are in the scope of this solicitation. For the continuous-fiber composites, the typical fiber areal weights range from approximately 30 grams per square meter (gsm) to just under 200 gsm. For short-fiber applications, the ultrathin plies in the single-digit gsm range are also of interest. Since a broad variety of composite material systems is within the scope of this solicitation, the scope of related manufacturability constraints can be tailored to the proposed material system. Consequently, the examples of manufacturability considerations provided in this solicitation are not all-inclusive, and parameters not listed below can be offered up for investigation when a compelling rationale is presented. The list of potential implementations of advanced tailorable composites is also provided to aid in the determination of manufacturing constraints of primary importance. The overarching approach should be based on recognizing that the more aggressive the tailoring of a composite material system, the greater the risk of developing defects in the manufacturing process. While avoiding any defects can be one countermeasure, quantifying the effects of defects can provide additional insights. Specifically, if the effect of defect can be quantified and it can be demonstrated that the benefits gained from the associated design tailoring can overcome the adverse effect of a small defect, then a rationale for the more aggressive tailoring can be justified. Examples of defects include, but are not limited to, tow gaps, overlaps, foldovers, or poor compaction/separation from the underlying plies. In cases where a placement imperfection can be subjected to restorative actions, analysis of how successful such actions can be is also of value.The manufacturability assessment shall be based on analytical tools validated with experimentation/actual manufacturability trials. Examples of the performance-based manufacturing constraints for the continuous-fiber composites include, but are not limited to, determination of the minimum allowable steering radius, relative proximity of ply terminations such that no significant adverse interaction occurs, and minimizing thermal warping in the cure process when nonsymmetric lamination stacking sequence is present. For example, one of the important examples of the manufacturability assessment for short-fiber composites is determination of an initial preform thickness distribution that would produce a desired thickness distribution after forming that involves preform expansion and/or turning or steering (i.e., forming similar to deep-stamping or closed-cross-section forming with a clamshell tool and an expandable bladder). Similarly, estimation of the short-fiber orientation distortions in the forming process and predictive countermeasures to this behavior are also sought.Subscale manufacturing demonstrations representative of the challenges that can be encountered in the full-scale applications are sought as the manufacturability predictive analysis validation cases. The full-scale structures of interest that can be scaled down for the manufacturing demonstrations include cryogenic tanks, crew modules, pressurized habitats, and other dry and unpressurized primary structural components or portions of thereof. Discrete features such as hatches, access and windows cutouts, and hard point attachments can be considered as manufacturability challenges to be encountered in the full-scale applications in addition to the general acreage considerations. Furthermore, manufacturability assessment for short-fiber composites is expanded to allow smaller size demonstrations, for example, those representative of hard point attachment brackets, hinges, clevises, etc.",5 to 6,"Level 1: TX 12 Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems, and Manufacturing

Suboptimal designs such as quasi-isotropic lamination stacking sequence treat the material as “black aluminum,” failing to permit tailored load paths possible with composites. Consequently, a material system that can enable large reductions in system mass ends up being used in the design process in a way that results in structural components that are much heavier than necessary.This solicitation seeks to advance the analytical predictive manufacturability assessment capabilities for layered composites. Such an assessment is required as a constraint in the structural design and optimization process. Layered pre-impregnated composite materials reinforced with either continuous or short fibers, and with a broad spectrum of ply thicknesses, are in the scope of this solicitation. For the continuous-fiber composites, the typical fiber areal weights range from approximately 30 grams per square meter (gsm) to just under 200 gsm. For short-fiber applications, the ultrathin plies in the single-digit gsm range are also of interest. Since a broad variety of composite material systems is within the scope of this solicitation, the scope of related manufacturability constraints can be tailored to the proposed material system. Consequently, the examples of manufacturability considerations provided in this solicitation are not all-inclusive, and parameters not listed below can be offered up for investigation when a compelling rationale is presented. The list of potential implementations of advanced tailorable composites is also provided to aid in the determination of manufacturing constraints of primary importance. The overarching approach should be based on recognizing that the more aggressive the tailoring of a composite material system, the greater the risk of developing defects in the manufacturing process. While avoiding any defects can be one countermeasure, quantifying the effects of defects can provide additional insights. Specifically, if the effect of defect can be quantified and it can be demonstrated that the benefits gained from the associated design tailoring can overcome the adverse effect of a small defect, then a rationale for the more aggressive tailoring can be justified. Examples of defects include, but are not limited to, tow gaps, overlaps, foldovers, or poor compaction/separation from the underlying plies. In cases where a placement imperfection can be subjected to restorative actions, analysis of how successful such actions can be is also of value.The manufacturability assessment shall be based on analytical tools validated with experimentation/actual manufacturability trials. Examples of the performance-based manufacturing constraints for the continuous-fiber composites include, but are not limited to, determination of the minimum allowable steering radius, relative proximity of ply terminations such that no significant adverse interaction occurs, and minimizing thermal warping in the cure process when nonsymmetric lamination stacking sequence is present. For example, one of the important examples of the manufacturability assessment for short-fiber composites is determination of an initial preform thickness distribution that would produce a desired thickness distribution after forming that involves preform expansion and/or turning or steering (i.e., forming similar to deep-stamping or closed-cross-section forming with a clamshell tool and an expandable bladder). Similarly, estimation of the short-fiber orientation distortions in the forming process and predictive countermeasures to this behavior are also sought.Subscale manufacturing demonstrations representative of the challenges that can be encountered in the full-scale applications are sought as the manufacturability predictive analysis validation cases. The full-scale structures of interest that can be scaled down for the manufacturing demonstrations include cryogenic tanks, crew modules, pressurized habitats, and other dry and unpressurized primary structural components or portions of thereof. Discrete features such as hatches, access and windows cutouts, and hard point attachments can be considered as manufacturability challenges to be encountered in the full-scale applications in addition to the general acreage considerations.

Test articles and facilities are highly instrumented to enable a comprehensive analysis of propulsion system performance. Advanced instrumentation has the potential for substantial reduction in time and cost of propulsion systems development, with substantially reduced operational costs and evolutionary improvements in ground, launch, and flight system operational robustness.Advanced instrumentation would provide a wireless, highly flexible instrumentation solution capable of measurement of heat flux, temperature, pressure, strain, and/or near-field acoustics. Temperature and pressure measurements must be acquired from within the facility mechanical systems or the rocket engine itself. These advanced instruments should function as a modular node in a sensor network, capable of performing some processing, gathering sensory information, and communicating with other connected nodes in the network. The collected sensor network must be capable of integration with data from conventional data acquisition systems adhering to strict calibration and timing standards to support static propulsion system testing standards. Synchronization with Inter-Range Instrumentation Group—Time Code Format B (IRIG-B) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceability is critical to propulsion test data analysis.Rocket propulsion test facilities also provide excellent testbeds for testing and using the innovative technologies for possible application beyond the static propulsion testing environment. These sensors would be capable of addressing multiple mission requirements for remote monitoring such as vehicle health monitoring in flight systems, autonomous vehicle operation, or instrumenting inaccessible measurement locations, all while eliminating cabling and auxiliary power. It is envisioned these advanced instrumentation would support sensing and control applications beyond those of propulsion testing. For example, inclusion of expert system or artificial intelligence technologies might provide great benefits for autonomous operations, health monitoring, or self-maintaining systems.This subtopic seeks to develop advanced wireless instrumentation capable of performing some processing, gathering sensory information and communicating with other connected nodes in the network. Sensor systems should have the ability to provide the following functionality:Acquisition and conversion to engineering units for quantifying heat flux, temperature, pressure, strain, and/or near-field acoustics such that it contributes to rocket engine system performance analysis within established standards for error and uncertainty. Capable of in-place calibrations with NIST traceability. Collected data must be time-stamped to facilitate analysis with other collected datasets. Transfer data in real time to other systems for monitoring and analysis. Interface to flight-qualified sensor systems, which could be used for multivehicle use. Determine the quality of the measurement and instrument state of health. Self-contained to collect information and relay measurements through various means by a sensor-web approach to provide a self-healing, autoconfiguring method of collecting data from multiple sensors, and relaying for integration with other acquired datasets. Function reliably in extreme environments, including rapidly changing ranges of environmental conditions, such as those experienced in space. These ranges may be from extremely cold temperatures, such as cryogenic temperatures, to extremely high temperatures, such as those experienced near a rocket engine plume.",3 to 6,"Level 1: TX 13 Ground, Test, and Surface Systems

Software","For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility with a final report at Phase I and show a path towards Phase II hardware/software demonstration with delivery of a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.","Highly modular, remote sensors are of interest to many NASA tests and missions. Real-time data from sensor networks reduces risk and provides data for future design improvements. Wireless sensors offer a highly flexible solution for scientists and engineers to collect data remotely. They can be used for thermal, structural, and acoustic measurement of systems and subsystems and also provide emergency system halt instructions in the case of leaks, fire, or structural failure. Other examples of potential NASA applications include (1) measuring temperature, strain, voltage, and current from power storage and generation systems, (2) measuring pressure, strain, and temperature in pumps and pressure vessels, and (3) measuring strain in test structures and ground support equipment and vehicles, including high-risk deployables.There are many other applications that would benefit from increased real-time sensing in remote hard-to-test locations. For example, sensor networks on a vehicle body can give measurement of temperature, pressure, strain, and acoustics. This data is used in real time to determine safety margins and test anomalies. The data is also used post-test to correlate analytical models and optimize vehicle and test design. Because these sensors are small and low mass, they can be used for ground test and for flight. Sensor module miniaturization will further reduce size, mass, and cost.No existing wireless sensor network option meets NASA’s current needs for flexibility, size, mass, and resilience to extreme environments.","This subtopic is relevant to the development of liquid propulsion systems development and verification testing in support of the Human Exploration and Mission Operations Directorate. It supports all test programs at Stennis Space Center (SSC) and other propulsion system development centers, and potential advocates are the Rocket Propulsion Test (RPT) Program Office and all rocket propulsion test programs at SSC.","

Focus Area 17 Thermal Management Systems,Z2.01Spacecraft Thermal Management, JSC," GRC, GSFC, JPL, MSFC", 2021,Spacecraft Thermal Management,"NASA seeks new technologies that will facilitate low-mass and highly reliable thermal control systems for the exploration of our solar system. This solicitation specifically targets proposals for new technologies and methods that clearly address one of the following areas:Novel three-way valves that can operate to either mix or split single-phase fluid flow passively. Lunar lander/surface asset thermal technologies. Embedded cooling of power electronics. Concepts for closed-loop extravehicular activity (EVA) thermal systems.These areas are considered of equal priority, and no award preference is expected for one area over another.Passive Three-Way Valves NASA seeks novel three-way valves that can operate as either a mixing valve (two liquid input ports and one liquid output port) or splitting valve (one liquid input port and two liquid output ports) that can be used to passively control loop temperatures by the degree fraction of radiator bypass. Such miniature passive thermal control valves could find use in a number of single-phase mechanically pumped fluid thermal control systems. Proposed technologies must address the following design goals:Design shall autonomously operate without power. <0.1% flow rate through the shutoff port, with a goal of having a provision for no leakage/adjustable leakage through the use of a pre-installed orifice. Control range of 5 to 10 oC, with pre-adjustable setpoint control. Operational temperature limits -55 to 90 oC, nonoperational limits of -55 to 125 oC. Designs shall be compatible with FC-72 working fluid as well as with those used on the International Space Station (ISS) thermal control loops (water and ammonia). Retrofit of soft goods is acceptable. Mass desired <250 g (maximum mass 500 g). Unit volume <50 cm3 (maximum 100 cm3). Leak rate 1×10-6 scc/s gHe at 200 psia. Minimum 4,000 full actuation cycles, desired 17,500 cycles. Rad hard to 300 krad. 200 psia maximum expected operating pressure, 200 psia proof pressure, 800 psia burst pressure. Pressure drop <1.5 psi at 1.5 L/min of FC-72 working fluid. Lunar Surface Thermal Technology Development NASA is seeking focused efforts to develop large human-class lunar lander technologies. Technologies should address a gap associated to long-duration habitation on the lunar surface, where temperatures range from -193 °C or lower in shadow regions (including night) to 120° C at the equatorial subsolar point. System technologies should be orientation insensitive; for example, lander side-mounted radiators must provide their function regardless of lunar surface temperature condition. Technologies are needed that allow a single vehicle design to operate in all these environments. Technologies should address reduction in mass, volume, and power usage relative to current solutions. Adding heaters can lead to increased vehicle mass due to additional power generation and storage requirements and are not considered a novel architecture approach. Proposed radiator technologies should also address micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) robustness and protection potential where appropriate. Examples of other challenges to address in this area include the deposition of dust on radiators leading to degraded optical properties, contamination-insensitive evaporators/sublimators to enable long mission life, and self-healing coolant tubes for MMOD-impact resilience. Technologies should be suitable for use in medium-sized landers that operate near 1-kW average heat dissipation capacity. Alternatively, technologies that utilize the conditions provided by the lunar environment to provide a critical function may also be considered; for example, air-water separator technologies that leverage the gravity field of the lunar surface, or concepts that explore the viability of utilizing the lunar surface regolith to provide long-duration thermal control function. As appropriate, such systems should also address functional capability in the microgravity environment that will be experienced prior to lunar surface operations. Proposed technologies should also be extensible to human-class landers that will have variable heat loads and average loads between 2 and 6 kW. All technologies should support a minimum flight duration of 5 years and be compatible with the encountered aerospace environment. This subtopic is different from S3.06 subtopic, which is focused on thermal control technologies for payloads and smaller robotic landers. Technologies directly applicable to that scale vehicle should consider reviewing the S3.06 Thermal Control Systems subtopic. Embedded Cooling of Power Electronics To optimize the performance of state-of-the-art power and propulsion systems, it is often advantageous to directly embed thermal control mechanisms within the packaged hardware. The key advantages are to enable a lower temperature drop between the heat source and heat rejection to allow for higher rejection temperatures, to remove heat from concentrated areas (avoid localized hot spots), and to provide more uniform temperatures within the electronics package. Applications for such technologies range from very high power nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) systems, to compact laser diodes, to embedded cooling of rotating equipment. Here we specifically desire concepts that have the potential to efficiently manage high-performance power electronics in common compact packages. At the device level, applications such as low-inductance GaN packages rely on low thermal impedance heat-sinking strategies which also facilitate mechanical compliance and often electrical isolation. Current state-of-the-art thermal gap fillers have functional thermal impedances of 1.5 to 11 K/W for 12-mm2 GaN devices with thermal transfer of 200 to 400 mW/mm2 [Ref. 6]. Solutions that improve these thermal impedances values by >50% are sought. At the system level, NASA has interest in the cooling of standard 3U boards to assist in the Advanced Modular Power Systems (AMPS) program. This program calls for semiconductor to circuit board power transfer of >200 mW/mm2, circuit board to backplane interface >5mW/mm2, and backplane interface through wedgelock rail >15 mW/mm2 with minimum thermal impedance [Ref. 7]. Example solutions include but are not limited to single-phase liquid jet cooling, heat pipes, and evaporation techniques. Any proposed solution should consider the material compatibility with the heat source and heat delivery to the vehicle’s primary active thermal control system as well as any adverse effects on the cooled electronics. Here, solutions may consider integration with either a traditional single-phase (liquid) vehicle active thermal loop or a two-phase (liquid-vapor) mechanically pumped active thermal loop. Power requirements to operate active systems must be addressed with the goal to minimize power. The transient performance of the proposed mechanism should be considered within the scope of the award in order to identify any key limitations of the design. Closed-Loop EVA Thermal Technologies EVA thermal control has traditionally relied on the dissipation of water to space. The current suit relies on a water sublimator, whereas the next-generation exploration spacesuit will include a water evaporator. In either case, water is consumed at an average rate of ~1 lb/hr over the course of the spacewalk. Here, NASA seeks novel closed-loop EVA thermal control technologies that have general potential for integration into future iterations of spacesuit design. Concepts should address the following key performance parameters, at a minimum:Nominal average heat rejection >350 W. Accommodate peak heat rejection of at least 700 W for 15 min, with little or no consumable loss. Support EVA duration of at least 4 hr, stretch goal of 8 hr. Demonstrate viability of integration with the liquid cooling garment operating at a minimum continuous temperature between 8 and 10 oC. Time to regenerate/recharge the system <12 hr. Any regeneration/recharge impacts to the spacecraft should be addressed within the scope of the award (vehicle mass, power, volume impact assessment).

Additionally, the exploration of embedded thermal control technologies may have a direct impact on the AMPS program in the near term and provide valuable insight into techniques for other embedded cooling applications. These improvements may come through either novel hardware solutions or modernization of software tools used to assess human vehicle interactions. The current state of the art in thermal control results in vehicle power and mass impact of greater than 25% to 30% due to old technologies still in use. Furthermore, as missions become more variable (dormancy, environments, etc.), the need for intelligent control (both actively and passively) within the thermal control system becomes more apparent. Science payloads will continue to decrease in size, increase in power, and require precise temperature control, all of which cannot be readily provided by traditional thermal control methods due to vehicle-level impacts of overall performance, mass/volume, and power.","Advanced Modular Power System Europa Clipper/Lander Lunar Lander Long-duration habitats (Moon, Mars, etc.) EVA","

Focus Area 19 Integrated Flight Systems,A2.03Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Integration, HQ, LaRC, 2021,AAM Community Integration - Weather Infrastructure Testbed,"AAM is a concept for safe, sustainable, affordable, and accessible aviation for transformational local and intraregional missions. AAM includes many potential mission types (e.g., passenger transport, aerial work, and cargo transport) that may be accomplished with many different aircraft types (e.g., manned and unmanned; conventional, short, and/or vertical takeoff and landing; all electric and hybrid electric; etc.) and are envisioned to bring aviation into people’s daily lives. Although passenger-carrying urban air mobility (UAM) is an AAM mission with much investment, other AAM missions, including but not limited to “thin haul”/regional air mobility, small package delivery, and medical transport, are also of interest. Responses to this subtopic are not limited to strictly any single AAM mission.Although limited manned, passenger-carrying UAM and other air taxi operations occur today, this market is ripe to expand as technologies such as electric propulsion and increasing autonomy converge enabling novel aircraft with enhanced capabilities. With time, the small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) market and manned UAM and air taxi markets may converge into a broader AAM market including both manned and unmanned vehicles. To start down the path to enabling this, ARMD has proposed an organizational framework, identified a set of barriers organized according to this framework that must be overcome to enable this market, and has identified NASA’s potential contributions to overcome these market impeding barriers.The AAM framework consists of five pillars: (1) aircraft design, (2) individual aircraft operations, (3) airspace design, (4) airspace and fleet operations, and (5) community integration. This solicitation focuses specifically on the community integration pillar (Refs 1-3, 6-8). Proposers seeking funding for aircraft design and individual aircraft operations should submit to vehicle technology subtopic in A1 and proposers seeking airspace design and operations funding should submit to the A3 topic.Scope 1 Weather Data Infrastructure Testbed—Weather data sensors are part of the weather infrastructure proposed in the UAM Maturity Level 4 (UML-4) ecosystem ConOps (concept of operations) (Refs 4 and 8).These sensors provide current weather conditions. The data they collect is an input into the UAM system for use by vehicle and vertiport operators and Providers of Services/UTM Supplemental Service Providers (PSUs/USSes) (Ref 6) and will also be utilized to validate forecasting models. This testbed should consider the innovative use of existing and new, fixed and mobile, and nontraditional weather sensors as part of the architecture; testing and validation of the accuracy of the sensors and data; new weather forecast techniques and/or ultrahigh spatial and temporal resolution weather forecast models tailored for UAM; and/or the assimilation of weather data from these sensors into weather models. The effort should consider the work being done by ASTM’s F38 WK73142 (Ref 5) and work towards a goal of increasing measurement density and scalability while incentivizing private sector companies to install weather sensing equipment, data delivery, and receive payment for the data by local government(s) and commercial Weather Supplemental Data Service Providers (SDSP) to improve UML-4 weather situational awareness and predictions. Phase I would also identify potential localities interested in hosting and utilizing the data from this testbed. Phase II would be to build the testbed in at least one locality and market for additional customers beyond those identified in Phase I.",2 to 4,"Level 1: TX 11 Software, Modeling, Simulation, and Information Processing

Phase I would also identify potential localities interested in hosting and utilizing the data from this testbed.Phase II would be to build the testbed in at least one locality and market for additional customers beyond those identified in Phase I.,The AAM marketplace is assessed at a UML-0 (see references). Technologies are needed to progress towards the desired UML-4 level where this model of travel is affordable to the general public.,AAM Mission Office.This subtopic is relevant to the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) AAM Mission and the eight projects supporting that mission.

Focus Area 19 Integrated Flight Systems,A2.03Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Integration, HQ, LaRC, 2021,AAM Community Integration - Weather Infrastructure Testbed,"AAM is a concept for safe, sustainable, affordable, and accessible aviation for transformational local and intraregional missions. AAM includes many potential mission types (e.g., passenger transport, aerial work, and cargo transport) that may be accomplished with many different aircraft types (e.g., manned and unmanned; conventional, short, and/or vertical takeoff and landing; all electric and hybrid electric; etc.) and are envisioned to bring aviation into people’s daily lives. Although passenger-carrying urban air mobility (UAM) is an AAM mission with much investment, other AAM missions, including but not limited to “thin haul”/regional air mobility, small package delivery, and medical transport, are also of interest. Responses to this subtopic are not limited to strictly any single AAM mission.Although limited manned, passenger-carrying UAM and other air taxi operations occur today, this market is ripe to expand as technologies such as electric propulsion and increasing autonomy converge enabling novel aircraft with enhanced capabilities. With time, the small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) market and manned UAM and air taxi markets may converge into a broader AAM market including both manned and unmanned vehicles. To start down the path to enabling this, ARMD has proposed an organizational framework, identified a set of barriers organized according to this framework that must be overcome to enable this market, and has identified NASA’s potential contributions to overcome these market impeding barriers.The AAM framework consists of five pillars: (1) aircraft design, (2) individual aircraft operations, (3) airspace design, (4) airspace and fleet operations, and (5) community integration. This solicitation focuses specifically on the community integration pillar (Refs 1-3, 6-8). Proposers seeking funding for aircraft design and individual aircraft operations should submit to vehicle technology subtopic in A1 and proposers seeking airspace design and operations funding should submit to the A3 topic.Scope 1 Weather Data Infrastructure Testbed—Weather data sensors are part of the weather infrastructure proposed in the UAM Maturity Level 4 (UML-4) ecosystem ConOps (concept of operations) (Refs 4 and 8).These sensors provide current weather conditions. The data they collect is an input into the UAM system for use by vehicle and vertiport operators and Providers of Services/UTM Supplemental Service Providers (PSUs/USSes) (Ref 6) and will also be utilized to validate forecasting models. This testbed should consider the innovative use of existing and new, fixed and mobile, and nontraditional weather sensors as part of the architecture; testing and validation of the accuracy of the sensors and data; new weather forecast techniques and/or ultrahigh spatial and temporal resolution weather forecast models tailored for UAM; and/or the assimilation of weather data from these sensors into weather models. The effort should consider the work being done by ASTM’s F38 WK73142 (Ref 5) and work towards a goal of increasing measurement density and scalability while incentivizing private sector companies to install weather sensing equipment, data delivery, and receive payment for the data by local government(s) and commercial Weather Supplemental Data Service Providers (SDSP) to improve UML-4 weather situational awareness and predictions. Phase I would also identify potential localities interested in hosting and utilizing the data from this testbed.

Proposals that are specific to other nontraditional operations (such as, but not limited to, space traffic management, automated air cargo, UTM, and ultrahigh altitude), without clear application to UAM/AAM, will be rejected.",Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP).Air Traffic Management-eXploration (ATM-X) Project.Successful technologies in this subtopic will help NASA pioneer UAM concepts and technologies. The technologies also incorporate new autonomy/artificial intelligence/data science methods and approaches to air transportation problems for current and near-future application.,"

Ultimately, functional area models will be digitally integrated to form a model-based enterprise.NASA is seeking specific innovative, transformational, model-based solutions in the area of “Digital Twin” Institutional Management of Health/Automated Decision Support of Agency Facilities that would greatly enhance operational efficiencies, the quality and robustness and trustworthiness of information, the ability to identify and analyze risks earlier, and the overall velocity and robustness of knowledge transfer and decision making across the Agency, including interactions with internal/external partners and supply chain that are made possible through overarching an MBx Digital Twin Enterprise model(s).Health/Automated Decision Support of Agency Facilities represents an opportunity to make revolutionary changes in how our Agency conducts business by investing in nascent technologies. The Agency’s newly minted Digital Transformation Office is interested in how this initiative can help reposition and accelerate the modernization of digital systems that support modern approaches to managing the Agency's aging infrastructure.Recent initiatives in ""smart city"" technologies focus on condition-based/preventive maintenance, smart buildings and smart lighting, autonomous transportation and traffic management, industrial automation, etc. As we mature our understanding and make progress toward these ends at individual centers, we need to align our efforts and share lessons learned to help expedite NASA’s learning curve.Smart city technologies often rely on interconnected systems and interoperability of those systems, making it all the more important that we have a common approach and standards (e.g., around information technology (IT)/operational technology (OT) network architecture, communication protocols, and data management) to ensure interoperability of systems within and across centers. Without a cohesive approach, we risk limiting what NASA can achieve in terms of economies of scale and affordability, as well as interorganizational data integration.The STTR vehicle offers the small business community an opportunity to have a hand in this process towards repositioning and accelerating the modernization of digital systems supporting the Agency's aging infrastructure to:Save energy costs due to water and electricity usage that is poorly measured and managed.

Working integrated software framework capable of direct compatibility with existing programmatic tools.","Outside of NASA, industry is rapidly advancing Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tools and scaling them to larger, more complex development activities. Industry sees scaling as a natural extension of their ongoing digitization efforts. These scaling and extension efforts will result in reusable, validated libraries containing models, model fragments, patterns, contextualized data, etc. They will enable the ability to build upon, transform, and synthesize new concepts and missions, which has great attraction to both industry and government alike. Real-time collaboration and refinement of these validated libraries into either “single source” or “authoritative sources” of truth provide further appeal as usable knowledge can be pulled together much more quickly from a far wider breadth of available knowledge than was ever available before.One example of industry applying MB/MBe/MBSE is through Digital Thread™, a communication framework that helps facilitate an integrated view and connected data flow of the product's data throughout its life cycle. In other words, it helps deliver the right information at the right time and at the right place. Creating an “identical” copy (sometimes referred to as a ""digital twin"") is another use, a digital replica of potential and actual physical assets, processes, people, places, systems, and devices that can be used for various purposes. These twins are used to conduct virtual cost/technical trade studies, virtual testing, virtual qualification, etc., that are made possible through an integrated model-based network. Given the rise of MBSE in industry, NASA will need to keep pace in order to continue to communicate with industry, manage and monitor supply chain activities, and continue to provide leadership in spaceflight development.Within NASA, our organization is faced with increasingly complex problems that require better, timelier, integration, and synthesis of both models and larger sets of data, not only in the systems engineering or MBSE realm, but in the broader MB Institution, MB Mission Management, and MB Enterprise Architecture. NASA is challenged to sift through and pull out the particular pieces of information needed for specific functions, as well as to ensure requirements are traced into designs, tested, and delivered; thus, confirming that the Agency gets what it has paid for. On a broader cross-agency scale, we need to ensure that needed information is available to support critical decisions in a timely and cost-effective manner. All of these challenges are addressed through the benefits of model-based approaches. Practices such as reusability, common sources of data, and validated libraries of authoritative information become the norm, not the exception, using an integrated, model-based environment. This model-based environment will contribute to a diverse, distributed business model encompassing multicenter and government-industry partnerships as the normal way of doing business.","MBx solutions can benefit all NASA Mission Directorates and functional organizations. NASA activities could be dramatically more efficient and lower risk through MBx support of more automated creation, execution, and completion verification of important agreements, such as international, supply chain, or data use.","

Focus Area 23 Digital Transformation for Aerospace,T11.05Model-Based Enterprise, ARC," HQ, LaRC, MSFC, SSC", 2021,"Model-Based Enterprise, Digitally interacting comprehensive frameworks and models, and Automated Decision-Making for Agency Operations","Model-based enterprise targets the use of models in any function, from engineering to safety to finance to facilities and more (i.e., Model-based ""Anything"" or MBx), to enable high-complexity decision making embodying agile processes to achieve efficiency, accuracy, confidence, and adaptability in support of NASA’s mission, programmatic development, and institutional activities.Consider the implementation of Model-based Institutional Management, as an example, where outputs from one functional model become real-time inputs to another functional model, resulting in a digital workflow for knowledge transfer and holistic decision making; thus enabling transformative gains in engineering, institutional, and management practices. Ultimately, functional area models will be digitally integrated to form a model-based enterprise.NASA is seeking specific innovative, transformational, model-based solutions in the area of “Digital Twin” Institutional Management of Health/Automated Decision Support of Agency Facilities that would greatly enhance operational efficiencies, the quality and robustness and trustworthiness of information, the ability to identify and analyze risks earlier, and the overall velocity and robustness of knowledge transfer and decision making across the Agency, including interactions with internal/external partners and supply chain that are made possible through overarching an MBx Digital Twin Enterprise model(s).Health/Automated Decision Support of Agency Facilities represents an opportunity to make revolutionary changes in how our Agency conducts business by investing in nascent technologies. The Agency’s newly minted Digital Transformation Office is interested in how this initiative can help reposition and accelerate the modernization of digital systems that support modern approaches to managing the Agency's aging infrastructure.Recent initiatives in ""smart city"" technologies focus on condition-based/preventive maintenance, smart buildings and smart lighting, autonomous transportation and traffic management, industrial automation, etc. As we mature our understanding and make progress toward these ends at individual centers, we need to align our efforts and share lessons learned to help expedite NASA’s learning curve.Smart city technologies often rely on interconnected systems and interoperability of those systems, making it all the more important that we have a common approach and standards (e.g., around information technology (IT)/operational technology (OT) network architecture, communication protocols, and data management) to ensure interoperability of systems within and across centers. Without a cohesive approach, we risk limiting what NASA can achieve in terms of economies of scale and affordability, as well as interorganizational data integration.The STTR vehicle offers the small business community an opportunity to have a hand in this process towards repositioning and accelerating the modernization of digital systems supporting the Agency's aging infrastructure to:Save energy costs due to water and electricity usage that is poorly measured and managed. Enable the deployment of nascent technological trends in data-driven decision making and support tools based upon statistical methods to help streamline and improve the efficiency of facility operations and maintenance activities. Explore recent technologies in modeling (e.g., digital twin techniques). Explore how we can take advantage of the proliferation of emerging technologies, use a structured measurement and verification technique in and aim to vet them to determine if they will bring sufficient value, and broadly deploy them across the Agency if proven effective.Set up a ""proving ground,"" model, in the same spirit as GSA's emerging building technologies program(link is external). Determine how well technologies using this model can be broadly deployed across NASA.",4 to 6,"Level 1: TX 11 Software, Modeling, Simulation, and Information Processing

Working integrated software framework capable of direct compatibility with existing programmatic tools.","Outside of NASA, industry is rapidly advancing Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tools and scaling them to larger, more complex development activities. Industry sees scaling as a natural extension of their ongoing digitization efforts. These scaling and extension efforts will result in reusable, validated libraries containing models, model fragments, patterns, contextualized data, etc. They will enable the ability to build upon, transform, and synthesize new concepts and missions, which has great attraction to both industry and government alike. Real-time collaboration and refinement of these validated libraries into either “single source” or “authoritative sources” of truth provide further appeal as usable knowledge can be pulled together much more quickly from a far wider breadth of available knowledge than was ever available before.One example of industry applying MB/MBe/MBSE is through Digital Thread™, a communication framework that helps facilitate an integrated view and connected data flow of the product's data throughout its life cycle. In other words, it helps deliver the right information at the right time and at the right place. Creating an “identical” copy (sometimes referred to as a ""digital twin"") is another use, a digital replica of potential and actual physical assets, processes, people, places, systems, and devices that can be used for various purposes. These twins are used to conduct virtual cost/technical trade studies, virtual testing, virtual qualification, etc., that are made possible through an integrated model-based network. Given the rise of MBSE in industry, NASA will need to keep pace in order to continue to communicate with industry, manage and monitor supply chain activities, and continue to provide leadership in spaceflight development.Within NASA, our organization is faced with increasingly complex problems that require better, timelier, integration, and synthesis of both models and larger sets of data, not only in the systems engineering or MBSE realm, but in the broader MB Institution, MB Mission Management, and MB Enterprise Architecture. NASA is challenged to sift through and pull out the particular pieces of information needed for specific functions, as well as to ensure requirements are traced into designs, tested, and delivered; thus, confirming that the Agency gets what it has paid for. On a broader cross-agency scale, we need to ensure that needed information is available to support critical decisions in a timely and cost-effective manner.

The EPG, especially the environment-facing EPG shell fabric, is the suit’s first line of defense against the extreme environment of the lunar surface. The EPG system must not only survive the environment but must perform per requirements and offer a level of protection to the underlying pressure garment system (PGS), portable life support system (PLSS), and informatics system.The EPG is subjected to the following extreme environments:1. ThermalExtreme hot (260 °F, 127 °C). Extreme cold (-280 °F, -173 °C). Possible exposure to permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) (-373 °F, -225 °C).2. Lunar regolith/dustHighly abrasive. Durability in the dust environment is a key requirement. The spacesuit must operate over prolonged exposure to and operation in the dusty regolith environment. This includes kneeling on the ground, thousands of walking cycles, and cleaning before ingressing the vehicle. Electrostatically charged. The suit is also required to severely limit the amount of dust brought into the vehicle. Therefore, materials that are easily cleaned and/or dissipative so that dust does not adhere to the suit are sought.3. RadiationThe material must be able to be durable over hundreds of hours of ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure. It is primarily only the environment-facing layer (outmost layer) of the EPG that must be resistant to degradation from the UV environment. To prevent damage from discharges, NASA is considering materials that support an EPG that is dissipative.4. Enriched oxygen atmosphere of the lunar lander in the Artemis programThe lunar lander in the Artemis program will have an atmosphere of 34±2% oxygen at a pressure of 8.2 psi (56.5 kPa). During the period the astronauts reside in the lander, they will need nonflammable materials for the outer layer of their lunar spacesuits.5. Suit penetration protectionLunar secondary ejecta. Microgravity impact. Low Earth orbit (LEO) micrometeroids.6. PlasmaCharged environment in contact with the suit.In addition to the extreme environments, other requirements include the following:1. Optical propertiesThe EPG shall have an average ratio of solar absorptivity to infrared emissivity (α/ε) of 0.21 (TBR). The EPG shall have an average solar absorption of 0.18 (TBR).2. MassUsing the current fabric layers, as a component the EPG weighs on the order of 16 lb. EMU layup mass (with seven layers aluminized Mylar) = 30.84 oz/yd2 (1.92 lb/yd2). Orthofabric = 14.0 oz/yd2 + 1.0 - 0.5. Aluminized Mylar = 1.12 oz/yd2 maximum. Neoprene-coated nylon = 9.0 oz/yd2 maximum. NASA has a goal of a 25% weight reduction.3. Mobility impactsWhile it is understood that the layered materials of the EPG will increase torque in the spacesuit joint by a small amount, the EPG cannot significantly affect mobility of the suit. This requires that the individual materials and the combination of the fabric layers of the EPG allow for joint mobility, such as bending of the elbow. The fabrics themselves must be flexible, and they must be flexible during exposure to the other environmental extremes, such as extreme low temperature and vacuum. Within the environment listed above, the EPG must be flexible and low mass while meeting all other architectural, functional, interface, structural, and design and construction requirements imposed on the xEMU and EPG system.Past program solutions do not meet the requirements of the Artemis program sustaining missions.Beta fabric, the glass fiber fabric used in the Apollo spacesuit, addressed only the high flammability risk in the Apollo Lunar Module (LM) atmosphere of 100% oxygen at 4.8 psi (33 kPa). The three extravehicular activities (EVAs) in the last Apollo mission, with an average combined duration of 22 hr, resulted in damage to the outer fabric of the Apollo spacesuits, and the suits could not have endured more EVAs. The glass fiber developed for NASA was the first-ever textile microfiber (3.8-µm fiber diameter) that would not burn in a 100% oxygen atmosphere, but it did not have the mechanical properties to withstand abrasion from the lunar regolith.In the EMU program for the Space Shuttle and International Space Station, the shell fabric was designed for LEO, a significantly different environment from the lunar South Pole. The most notable difference is the absence of abrasives in LEO—no lunar dust. Orthofabric, the three-fiber shell fabric developed for the Space Shuttle suit outer layer, was designed for the Shuttle airlock oxygen concentration of 30% at 10.2 psi (70.3 kPa) and for durability. While the Orthofabric does not support combustion in an exploration environment of 36% oxygen atmosphere at 8.2 psi, it is a woven fabric. The interstices of the weave (gaps between yarns) allow for some amount of lunar dust to penetrate, and therefore it is a poor barrier to dust. In addition, the GORE-TEX expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) film is easily abraded by the dust. Although GORE-TEX is a PTFE (Teflon) and inert, it can accumulate a charge.In short, NASA is without adequate softgoods/textile solutions for the outermost layer of the EPG system that covers the xEMU suit system. NASA is looking for innovative materials solutions, likely requiring a layup of materials, to address all of the requirements listed above.",3 to 4,"Level 1: TX 06 Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation Systems

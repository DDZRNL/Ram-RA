TA1 Launch Propulsion Systems,TA1.3 Air Breathing Propulsion Systems,A3.03Low Emissions/Clean Power, GRC, LaRC,"Achieving low emissions and finding new pathways to cleaner power are critical for the development of future air vehicles. Vehicles for subsonic and supersonic flight regimes will be required to operate on a variety of certified aircraft fuels and emit extremely low amounts of gaseous and particulate emissions to satisfy increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Future vehicles will be more fuel-efficient which will result in smaller engine cores operating at higher pressures. Fundamental combustion research coupled with associated physics based model development of combustion processes will provide the foundation for technology development critical for these vehicles. Combustion involves multi-phase, multi-component fuel, turbulent, unsteady, 3-D, reacting flows where much of the physics of the processes are not completely understood. CFD codes used for combustion do not currently have the predictive capability that is typically found for non-reacting flows. Low emissions combustion concepts require very rapid mixing of the fuel and air with a minimum pressure loss to achieve complete combustion in the smallest volume. Areas of specific interest where research is solicited include: Development of laser-based diagnostics for quantitative spatially and temporally resolved measurements of fuel/air ratio in reacting flows at elevated pressure. Development of ultra-sensitive instruments for determining the size-dependent mass of combustion generated particle emissions. Low emissions combustor concepts for small high pressure engine cores. Chemical kinetics mechanisms with approximately 20 species for Jet-A fuel suitable for use with 3-D Combustion CFD Codes. Read less>>"
TA2 In-Space Propulsion Technologies,TA2.1 Chemical Propulsion,H2.02In-Space Chemical Propulsion, GRC," JSC, MSFC","This solicitation intends to examine a range of key technology options associated with non-toxic storable liquid propulsion systems for use in future exploration missions. Efficient propulsive performance and long duration storage attributes have made the use of hydrazine widespread across the aerospace community. However, hydrazine is highly corrosive and toxic, creating a need for non-toxic, high performance propellants for NASA, other government agencies, academia, and the commercial space industry. Non-toxic engine liquid mono- and bi-propellants technologies are desired for use in lieu of the currently operational hydrazine based engine technologies. Handling and safety concerns with the current toxic chemical propellants can lead to more costly propulsion systems.

Demonstrations of a hydrazine alternative in a storable liquid mono- or bi-propellant chemical propulsion system implementation relevant to at least one of the following applications are desired: in-space reaction control propulsion, in-space primary propulsion, and launch vehicle reaction control propulsion. Non-toxic technologies could range from pump fed or pressure fed thruster systems from 1 to 1000 lbf. Specific technologies of interest to meet proposed engine requirements include: Non-toxic mono- and bi-propellants that meet performance targets (as indicated by high specific impulse and high specific impulse density) while improving safety and reducing handling operations as compared to current state-of-the-art storable propellants.

TA2 In-Space Propulsion Technologies,TA2.2 Non-Chemical Propulsion,H2.03Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP), MSFC," GRC, JSC","This subtopic seeks to develop innovative NTP technologies supporting the needs of future space exploration. Solid core NTP has been identified as an advanced propulsion concept which could provide the fastest trip times with fewer SLS launches than other propulsion concepts for human missions to Mars over a variety of mission years. The current NASA Strategic Space Technology Investment Plan states NTP is a high priority technology needed for future human exploration of Mars. NTP had major technical work done between 1955-1973 as part of the Rover and Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA) programs. A few other NTP programs followed including the Space Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (SNTP) program in the early 1990's. The NTP concept is similar to a liquid chemical propulsion system, except instead of combustion in the thrust chamber, a monopropellant is heated with a fission reactor (heat exchanger) in the thrust chamber. In addition, the engine components and surrounding structures are exposed to a radiation environment formed by the reactor during operation. This solicitation will examine a range of modern technologies associated with NTP using solid core nuclear fission reactors. The engines are pump fed ~15,000-35,000 lbf with a specific impulse goal of 900 seconds (using hydrogen), and are used individually or in clusters for the spacecraft's primary propulsion system. The NTP can have multiple start-ups (>4) with cumulative run time >100 minutes in a single mission, which can last a few years. Specific technologies of interest to meet the proposed requirements include: High temperature (> 2600K), low burn-up composite, carbide, and/or ceramic-metallic (cermet) based nuclear fuels with improved coatings and/or claddings to maximize hydrogen propellant heating and to reduce fission product gas release and particulates into the engine's hydrogen exhaust stream. Long life, lightweight, reliable turbopump modeling, designs and technologies including seals, bearing and fluid system components. Throttle ability is also considered. Zero net positive suction head (NPSH) hydrogen inducers have been demonstrated that can ingest 20-30% vapor by volume. The goal would be to develop inducers that can ingest 55% vapor by volume for up to 8 hours with less than 10 percent head fall off at the design point. Develop the capability to model (predict) turbopump cavitation dynamics. This includes first order rotating and alternating cavitation (1.1X 2X) and higher (6X-10X) order cavitation dynamics. Highly-reliable, long-life, fast-acting propellant valves with ultra-low hydrogen leakage that tolerate long duration space mission environments with reduced volume, mass, and power requirements are also desirable. Large propellant tank bottom valves can be expected to leak in the order of 1cc per minute of hydrogen measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP). For deep space missions valve leakage will need to be <.01 cc per minute at STP. Demonstrate a large tank bottom valve that can maintain a .01 cc per minute at STP. The valve should be able to cycle 10 times and maintain that leak rate. Valve cycle time can be on the order of one minute or more. High temperature and cryogenic radiation tolerant instrumentation and avionics for engine health monitoring. Non-invasive designs for measuring neutron flux (outside of reactor), chamber temperature, operating pressure, and liquid hydrogen propellant flow rates over wide range of temperatures are desired. Sensors need to operate for months/years instead of hours. Robonaut type inspections for prototype flight test considered. Concepts to cool down the reactor decay heat after shutdown to minimize the amount of open cycle propellant used in each engine shutdown. Depending on the engine run time for a single burn, cool-down time can take many hours. Technology needed to store the NTP propellant for multiple years in-space as liquid hydrogen with almost zero boil-off for 900 days (includes time from first launch to final trans earth injection burn). Innovations are needed in thermal control materials and design, mechanical refrigeration systems, and vehicle design. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards Phase II hardware/software demonstration with delivery of a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.

Small Satellite/CubeSat Propulsion The small satellite (<180kg) market shows significant promise to enable low cost science missions. Launch vehicle providers, like SLS, are considering a large number of secondary payload opportunities. The majority of small satellite missions flown are often selected for concept or component demonstration activities as the primary objectives. Opportunities are anticipated to select future small satellite missions based on application goals (i.e., science return). However, several technology limitations prevent high value science from low-cost small spacecraft, such as post deployment propulsion capabilities. Additionally, propulsion systems often place constraints on handling, storage, operations, etc., that may limit secondary payload consideration. Specifically, proposals are sought for propulsion systems capable of full scale flight demonstration on 12U CubeSats or smaller; to enable science through secondary payloads carried by SLS or other launch vehicles. Mission applications can be extended up to ESPA based or up to 180kg spacecraft. Proposals are sought that can deliver hardware products and proof-of-concept demonstrations in Phase I.

In addition, high energy-density rechargeable electrochemical battery systems that offer greater than 50,000 charge/discharge cycles (10 year operating life) for low-earth-orbiting spacecraft, 20 year life for geosynchronous (GEO) spacecraft, are desired. Advancements to battery energy storage capabilities that address one or more of the above requirements for the stated missions combined with very high specific energy and energy density (>200 Wh/kg for secondary battery systems), along with radiation tolerance are of interest. In addition to batteries, other advanced energy storage/load leveling technologies designed to the above mission requirements, such as mechanical or magnetic energy storage devices, are of interest. These technologies have the potential to minimize the size and mass of future power systems. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II, and when possible, deliver a demonstration unit for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase II emphasis should be placed on developing and demonstrating the technology under relevant test conditions. Additionally, a path should be outlined that shows how the technology could be commercialized or further developed into science-worthy systems. Patent 6,461,944, Methods for growth of relatively large step-free SiC crystal surfaces Neudeck, et al., October 8, 2002. A method for growing arrays of large-area device-size films of step-free (i.e., atomically flat) SiC surfaces for semiconductor electronic device applications is disclosed. This method utilizes a lateral growth process that better overcomes the effect of extended defects in the seed crystal substrate that limited the obtainable step-free area achievable by prior art processes. The step-free SiC surface is particularly suited for the heteroepitaxial growth of 3C (cubic) SiC, AlN, and GaN films used for the fabrication of both surface-sensitive devices (i.e., surface channel field effect transistors such as HEMT's and MOSFET's) as well as high-electric field devices (pn diodes and other solid-state power switching devices) that are sensitive to extended crystal defects.

TA3 Space Power and Energy Storage,TA3.4 Cross Cutting Technology,S3.01Power Generation and Conversion, GRC," ARC, JPL, JSC","Future NASA science missions will employ Earth orbiting spacecraft, planetary spacecraft, balloons, aircraft, surface assets, and marine craft as observation platforms. Proposals are solicited to develop advanced power-generation and conversion technologies to enable or enhance the capabilities of future science missions. Requirements for these missions are varied and include long life, high reliability, significantly lower mass and volume, higher mass specific power, and improved efficiency over the state of practice for components and systems. Other desired capabilities are high radiation tolerance and the ability to operate in extreme environments (high and low temperatures and over wide temperature ranges). While power-generation technology affects a wide range of NASA missions and operational environments, technologies that provide substantial benefits for key mission applications/capabilities are being sought in the following areas: Radioisotope Power Conversion Radioisotope technology enables a wide range of mission opportunities, both near and far from the Sun and hostile planetary environments including high energy radiation, both high and low temperature and diverse atmospheric chemistries. Technology innovations capable of advancing lifetimes, improving efficiency, highly tolerant to hostile environments are desired for all thermal to electric conversion technologies considered here.

TA3 Space Power and Energy Storage,TA3.4 Cross Cutting Technology,S3.06Terrestrial and Planetary Balloons, GSFC, JPL,"Terrestrial Balloons NASA’s Scientific Balloons provide practical and cost effective platforms for conducting discovery science, development and testing for future space instruments, as well as training opportunities for future scientists and engineers. Balloons can reach altitudes above 36 kilometers, with suspended masses up to 3600 kilograms, and can stay afloat for several weeks. Currently, the Balloon Program is on the verge of introducing an advanced balloon system that will enable 100 day missions at mid-latitudes and thus resemble the performance of a small spacecraft at a fraction of the cost. In support of this development, NASA is seeking innovative technologies in two key areas: Power Storage - Improved devices to store electrical energy onboard balloon payloads are needed. Long duration balloon flights can experience 12 hours or more of darkness, and excess electrical power generated during the day from solar panels needs to be stored and used. Improvements are needed over the current state of the art in power density, energy density, overall size, overall mass and/or cost. Typical parameters for balloon are 28 VDC and 100 to 1000 watts power consumption. Rechargeable batteries are presently used for balloon payload applications. Lithium Ion rechargeable batteries with energy densities of 60 watt-hours per kilogram are the current state of the art. Satellite Communications - Improved downlink bitrates using satellite relay communications from balloon payloads are needed. Long duration balloon flights currently utilize satellite communication systems to relay science and operations data from the balloon to ground based control centers. The current maximum downlink bit rate is 150 kilobits per second operating continuously during the balloon flight. Future requirements are for bit rates of 1 megabit per second or more. Improvements in bit rate performance, reduction in size and mass of existing systems, or reductions in cost of high bit rate systems are needed. TDRSS and Iridium satellite communications are currently used for balloon payload applications. A commercial S-band TDRSS transceiver and mechanically steered 18 dBi gain antenna provide 150 kbps continuous downlink. TDRSS K-band transceivers are available but are currently cost prohibitive. Open port Iridium service is under development, but the operational cost is prohibitive. Planetary Balloons Innovations in materials, structures, and systems concepts have enabled buoyant vehicles to play an expanding role in planning NASA's future Solar System Exploration Program. Balloons are expected to carry scientific payloads at Titan and Venus that will perform in situ investigations of their atmospheres and near surface environments. Both Titan and Venus feature extreme environments that significantly impact the design of balloons for those two worlds. Proposals are sought in the following areas: Steerable Antenna for Titan and Venus Telecommunications - Many concepts for Titan and Venus balloons require high gain antennas mounted on the balloon gondola to transmit data directly back to Earth. This approach requires that the antenna remain mechanically or electronically pointed at the Earth despite the motions experienced during balloon flight. A beacon signal from the Earth will be available to facilitate pointing. Innovative concepts are sought for such an antenna and pointing system with the following characteristics: dish antenna diameter of 0.8 m (or equivalent non-dish gain), total mass of antenna and pointing system of ≤ 10 kg, power consumption for the steering system ≤ 5 W (avg.), pointing accuracy ≤ 0.5 deg (continuous), hemispheric pointing coverage (2 pi steradians), azimuthal and rotational slew rates ≥ 30 deg/sec. It is expected that a Phase I effort will involve a proof-of-concept experiment leading to a plan for full scale prototype fabrication and testing in Phase II. Phase II testing will need to include an Earth atmosphere balloon flight in the troposphere to evaluate the proposed design under real flight conditions. Altitude-Cycling Balloons for Venus - NASA is interested in Venus balloons that continuously cycle across a wide altitude range without the use of ballast drops. Such balloons not only enable scientific measurements at different altitudes, they also enable the periodic cooling of the payload during the time spent at the highest altitude. Innovative concepts and system-level solutions are sought for such an altitude cycling Venus balloon with the following characteristics: a minimum cycling altitude of 45 km or lower, a maximum cycling altitude of 58 km or higher, a balloon large enough to carry a 100 kg payload, and a flight duration of at least 14 (Earth) days comprising both day and night conditions. It is expected that a Phase I effort will consist of a complete system-level design and a proof-of-concept experiment on one or more key components. Read less>>"

Mobility technologies are needed to enable access to crater walls, canyons, gullies, sand dunes, and high rock density regions for planetary bodies where gravity dominates, such as the Moon and Mars. Trafficability challenges include steep terrain, obstacle size, and low soil cohesion. Tethered systems, non-wheeled systems, and marsupial systems are examples of mobility technologies that are of interest. Technologies to enable mobility on small bodies in micro-gravity environments are also of interest. Manipulation technologies are needed to enable deployment of sampling tools and handling of samples. Mars mission sample-handling technologies are needed to enable transfer and storage of a range of rock and regolith cores approximately 1cm long and up to about 10cm long. Small-body mission manipulation technologies are needed to deploy sampling tools to the surface and transfer samples to in-situ instruments and sample storage containers. Sample acquisition tools are needed to acquire samples on planetary and small bodies. For Mars, a coring tool is needed to acquire rock and regolith cores approximately 1cm diameter and up to 10cm long which also supports transfer of the samples to a sample handling system. Abrading bits for the tool are needed to provide rock-surface abrasion capability to better than 0.2mm scale roughness. A deep drill is needed to enable sample acquisition from the subsurface including rock cores to 3m depth and icy samples from deeper locations. Tools for sampling from asteroids and comets are needed which support transfer of the sample for in-situ analysis or sample return. Tools for acquisition and transfer of icy samples on Europa are also of interest. Minimization of mass and ability to work reliably in the harsh mission environment are important characteristics for the tools. Example environmental conditions include microgravity for small-body missions, high temperature and pressure (460 °C, 93bar) on Venus, and at Europa the radiation environment is estimated at 2.9 Mrad total ionizing dose (TID) behind 100 mil thick aluminum. Contamination control and planetary protection are important considerations for sample acquisition and handling technologies. Contamination may include Earth-source contaminants produced by the sampling tool, handling system, or deposited on the sampling location from another source on the rover. ""Cleaning to sterility"" technologies are needed that will be compatible with spacecraft materials and processes. Surface cleaning validation methods are needed that can be used routinely to quantify trace amounts (~ng/cm2) of organic contamination and submicron particle (~100nm size) contamination.

"TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems",TA4.5 Autonomy,H6.01Spacecraft Autonomy and Space Mission Automation, ARC," JPL, JSC","Future human spaceflight missions will place crews at large distances and light-time delays from Earth, requiring novel capabilities for crews and ground to manage spacecraft consumables such as power, water, propellant and life support systems to prevent Loss of Mission (LOM) or Loss of Crew (LOC). This capability is necessary to handle events such as leaks or failures leading to unexpected expenditure of consumables coupled with lack of communications. If crews in the spacecraft must manage, plan and operate much of the mission themselves, NASA must migrate operations functionality from the flight control room to the vehicle for use by the crew. Migrating flight controller tools and procedures to the crew on-board the spacecraft would, even if technically possible, overburden the crew. Enabling these same monitoring, tracking, and management capabilities on-board the spacecraft for a small crew to use will require significant automation and decision support software. Required capabilities to enable future human spaceflight to distant destinations include: Enable on-board crew management of vehicle consumables that are currently flight controller responsibilities. Increase the onboard capability to detect and respond to unexpected consumables-management related events and faults without dependence on ground. Reduce up-front and recurring software costs to produce flight-critical software. Provide more efficient and cost effective ground based operations through automation of consumables management processes, and up-front and recurring mission operations software costs. The same capabilities for enabling human spaceflight missions are directly applicable to efforts to automate the operation of unmanned aircraft flying in the National Airspace (NAS) and robotic planetary explorers.

They will possess reconfigurable avionics and communication subsystems and will be designed to require less intervention from Earth during periods of low activity. Concurrently, the downlink data rate demands from Earth science spacecraft will be increasing. The communication needs of these missions motivate higher data rate capabilities on the uplink and downlink, as well as more reliable RF and timing subsystems. Innovative long-range telecommunications technologies that maximize power efficiency, reliability, receiver capability, transmitted power, and data rate, while minimizing size, mass, and DC power consumption are required. The current state-of-the-art in long-range RF deep space telecommunications is 6 Mbps from Mars using microwave communications systems (X-Band and Ka-Band) with output power levels in the low tens of Watts and DC-to-RF efficiencies in the range of 10-25%. Due to the applicability of communication components and subsystems with science instruments such as radar, technologies that can benefit both RF communication and advanced instruments are within the scope of this subtopic.

Solid-state multi-function modules that can be commanded to toggle between amplifying conventional digital modulation format signals for communications to pulsed operation for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with resolution on the order of few meters. Ultra low-noise amplifiers (MMICs or hybrid, uncooled) for RF front-ends (< 50 K noise temperature). High dynamic range (> 65 dB), data rate receivers (> 20 Mbps) supporting BPSK/QPSK modulations.

"TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems",TA6.1 Environmental Control Life Support & Habitation Systems,H3.03Human Accommodations and Habitation Systems for Future Exploration Missions, JSC," ARC, KSC, MSFC","Habitation systems that are dispersed throughout a spacecraft volume need to be investigated as a system to improve future human accommodations. Current spacecraft interiors exceed acoustic limits from a wide range of equipment; have manual inventory tracking and no capability for assistance of lost items; and require substantial crew time and wipes for cleaning common crew surfaces (hand rails and panels) and water/solids hygiene surfaces. Future spacecraft interiors will need to be reconfigurable to meet changing crew needs as a mission moves from launch, transit, and exploration-destination phases. Adaptable distributed habitation technologies are needed in the following areas. Quiet Crew Cabin Environments - Smaller future vehicles will unlikely have dedicated quiet volumes for crew rest so maintaining a quiet cabin is required. Crew cabin acoustic noise mitigation needs to control noise levels to enable improved voice communication, alarm signal to noise ratio, and reduce crew fatigue from long duration noise exposure. There is need for non-wearable active and passive noise cancellation/reduction strategies for open crew cabin environment that do not impede voice or alarms. Need for adaptive broad coverage area to accommodate changing crew cabin layout and volume. Crew Item Location Capability - Significant crew time is lost in tracking or locating items at the piece part level in space habitat environment that serves both as living quarters and laboratory. Items are sometimes misplaced or simply float away in the microgravity environment. Innovative approaches are sought for automatic location and tracking of a large number of individual crew items as they move from their original launch configuration to any area in the crew cabin. Crew items range in size from pill size, hand tools, clothing, and spare equipment and vary in material composition from non-metallic, metallic, to fluid containing. There is a need for low-power, and miniature Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) readers for dense storage and sparse tag environments. Flexible reader deployment that allows individual item autonomous logistics management tracking and precise 3-D locating are desired. Solutions providing enhanced localization utilizing the EPCglobal UHF reader-tag protocols (Class 1 Gen2 or advanced classes) are of high interest. Similar types of reader-tag communication protocols at higher frequencies that enable more accurate spatial localization are also of interest. Innovative algorithmic solutions for finding lost items, based on RFID or similar sensory information, are also of interest. All solutions must accommodate a highly reflective and complex scattering environment such as a conductive habitat cylindrical volume of ~ 3.5 m diameter ~6 m in length. Crew Cabin Surfaces - Crew activity and surface contact of fabric and solid surfaces result in generation and accumulation of particulate, moisture, organic, and salt. Surface treatments for fabrics and solid surfaces to prevent this accumulation of contaminants are needed to reduce crew time and the large number of wipes used for cleaning. Innovative low out gassing, super hydrophobic, super hydrophilic, antistatic, and antimicrobial treatments are needed for crew hygiene areas and waste collection hardware is needed. Non-mechanical fastener/non-particle generating removable physical connections are needed for repeated reconfiguring of interior volumes on longer missions. Examples of the types of temporary and reversible physical connections include crew restraints (e.g., hand rails), close out panels, and the hook-and-loop type fasteners present on most crew items. Phase I Deliverables - Detailed analysis, proof of concept test data, material test coupons, key algorithms/ subroutines, and predicted performance comparison to industry state of the art. Phase II Deliverables - Comparison of analysis to prototype test data in representative environment, sufficient material samples/components for independent evaluation, functional software, functional breadboard component hardware and/or system, and operations documentation.

A major focus of technology development is to increase reliability of water recovery systems, so these systems require less crew intervention and a lower risk of failure with longer operational lifetimes. With these goals in mind, two areas of interest have been identified for further focus: Water Recovery Post-Processing Systems - Technologies are needed to increase the reliability of systems for polishing of partially-treated wastewater. The current state of the art uses catalytic oxidation to remove dissolved organic carbon contaminants. Technologies that operate below 100 °C or ambient pressure are desirable. Examples of these technologies include low-temperature catalytic oxidation, photolysis, or photocatalysis. Monitoring Systems for Mineral Species in Water & Wastewater - A capability is needed to measure dissolved mineral ions in water and wastewater, including polyatomic ions (could encompass organic ions) and the alkaline, alkaline-earth and transition metals. Multi-analyte capability is needed, such as that available from ion chromatography and plasma spectroscopy. Potential applications include measurement of typical ionic species in humidity condensate, potable water, wastewater, byproducts of water treatment such as brines, and biomedical and science samples. Desirable attributes should include minimal sample preparation, minimal consumables, in situ calibration, and operation in microgravity and partial gravity. At the completion of Phase I, the technology should be TRL 3. The expected deliverable for Phase I is a detailed report describing experimental methods and results, with a clear feasibility demonstration of critical technology components.

"TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems",TA6.3 Human Health and Performance,H12.01Next Generation Oxygen Concentrator for Medical Scenarios, GRC, JSC,"For exploration missions, a contingency system which concentrates the oxygen within the cabin environment and provides the required concentration of oxygen to the crewmember for various medical scenarios will be necessary. Oxygen concentration technology is being pursued to concentrate oxygen from the ambient environment so that oxygen as a consumable resource and the fire hazard of an elevated cabin oxygen atmosphere can be reduced. The goal of this project is to develop an oxygen concentration module that minimizes the hardware mass, volume, and power footprint while still performing at the required clinical capabilities. An Oxygen Concentrator Module (OCM) with an adjustable positive pressure output 2-15 lpm of O2 at 50% to >90% oxygen concentrations by volume has been recommended by the flight medical team. The unit must be able to operate continuously in microgravity and partial gravity exploration atmospheres that include the atmospheres of 14.7 psia/21% oxygen, 10.2 psia/26.5% oxygen, and 8.2 psia/34% oxygen by volume. The unit must run continuously on available spacecraft power, and be switchable between 28 VDC and120 VDC. It must have adequate heat rejection so as to not exceed a touch temperature of 45oC. It is also highly desirable to have a portable low output capability for use in EVA pre-breathing or patient transfer between vehicles. Usage scenarios for oxygen treatment of smoke inhalation or toxic spills also predicates the need for an inlet filter on the unit that removes (converts/absorbs/filters) toxic gases from the delivered gas stream to the patient. The OCM system should be capable of regulating the oxygenation of the patient using a closed loop feedback system that senses the oxygenation level of the patient tissues and adjusts the oxygen flow rate and/or oxygen concentration according to treatment protocols for the illness being treated. The system shall also be able to operate open loop in the event of feedback signal failure. The control variable(s) are not specified (rate/concentration) here since the basic unit’s topology may dictate how the regulation is best achieved. Because the system may be configured during times of duress, it shall be user friendly to the caretaker by adopting a “plug and play” philosophy. This SBIR Phase I development is to determine the architecture of such a system exhibiting the characteristics (high capacity flow range, closed-loop tissue oxygen control, and operations in microgravity or partial gravity exploration atmospheres), a description of the basic unit as a sub-system component, method of optimizing power over the range of flows and oxygen levels, redundancy and sparing for a long duration missions, and the relationship of the OCM system to caretaker (what does the caretaker need to do to fulfill the medical need?). Phase I Requirements - Phase I should concentrate on developing the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of the proposed innovation resulting in a feasibility report and concept, complete with analyses that discuss functionality in microgravity and at the proposed exploration atmospheres, algorithms for closed-loop oxygenation protocols, and inlet filtering of smoke or toxic gases.

The ability to rapidly detect changes in bone mineral balance (BMB) in crewmembers living on ISS would have great potential as a surveillance tool for future exploration missions. Calcium isotopes have been shown to detect changes in BMB on very short timescales (e.g., one week). In order to detect these important changes, a technological device could be used in-flight. Thus, we are seeking a device (portable to bench top size) with the same accuracy and precision as is currently available in the non-flyable Multiple Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma mass spectrophotometer. Phase I Requirements - The sensitivity required to make the Calcium isotope measurements would need to be approximately 1012-1016 (i.e., this is how sensitive the machine should be for finding the Calcium isotope; it should be able to pick up one “atom” or unit in a pool of 1016 other things). Systems that measure elemental composition typically have sensitivities around 106-109 for some elements. The absolute concentrations of the isotopes are not required. We are looking for an instrument that can measure the variations in the ratio of any two Calcium isotopes on the order of 0.1-0.5 parts per 10,000 (44Ca/42Ca) but could vary depending on the isotopes used.

"TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems",TA6.3 Human Health and Performance,H12.03Objective Sleep Measures for Spaceflight Operations, JSC, JSC,"Currently in spaceflight, crewmembers report their sleep duration as requested by their crew surgeon. This approach has several limitations, including the burden it places on the crew and the tendency for subjective over-reporting of sleep (Lauderdale et al., 2008; Van Den Berg et al., 2008; Silva et al., 2007). Given evidence that demonstrates the relationship between sleep and circadian phase and performance, sleep-activity data should be collected as unobtrusively possible during long duration spaceflight. Wrist-worn actigraphy has been implemented as a successful, validated research tool in spaceflight but lacks features to render it a useful tool operationally, such as real-time feedback and minimal crew time requirements. Hence, there is a need for a minimally obtrusive or unobtrusive measure that evaluates sleep-wake activity plus light exposure; is acceptable for continuous wear; minimizes crew time by allowing for automatic downloads; provides immediate feedback to the user; incorporates the constraints of spaceflight hardware, such as extended battery life; and potentially incorporates other features, including other physiological sensors. The proposed technology should build on existing technologies with a focus on enhancing the product to ensure spaceflight readiness. Requirements - Phase I should concentrate on the enhancement of a prototype device providing minimally obtrusive data collection that objectively measures sleep duration and other relevant characteristics in the spaceflight environment. Phase II should also yield a plan for continued development (if needed) and for validation of the device prior to spaceflight implementation. NASA Deliverables - An objective, validated measure of sleep that is feasible and acceptable in the spaceflight environment.

Safe, nutritious, acceptable, and varied foods with a shelf life of five years will be required to support the crew. Concurrently, the food system requirements must efficiently balance with their use of vehicle resources such as mass, volume, water, air, waste, power, and crew time. NASA provisions currently consist solely of shelf stable foods due to vehicle resource limitations preventing food refrigeration or freezing. Stability is achieved by thermal, irradiative processing, or drying to kill or prevent microorganism growth in the food. These methods coupled with environmental factors (such as moisture ingress and oxidation) impact the micronutrients within the food. Since the food system is the sole source of nutrition to the crew, a significant loss in nutrient availability could jeopardize the health and performance of the crew. This subtopic requests methods or technologies that enable development of an acceptable and safe food system to deliver appropriate amounts of bioavailable nutrients to crewmembers throughout a five year mission with no resupply. Vitamin content in NASA foods, such as vitamin C, vitamin K, thiamin, and folic acid, are key nutrients degraded during processing and storage. NASA is seeking novel food ingredients, protective or stabilizing technologies (e.g., encapsulation), controlled-release systems, or novel processing technologies that allow the delivery of key nutrients at the time of consumption. Consideration must be given to food safety as well as acceptability, as under-consumption will similarly lead to nutritional deficiencies. Deliverables - Feasibility demonstration of a novel food system approach with the potential to enable vitamin stability in an acceptable and safe food system for extended duration missions. Phase I should include a comprehensive report detailing the system feasibility, and show a clear path to Phase II development and analyses, with the expectation that Phase II will demonstrate that the food system will retain 70% of original content of vitamin C, vitamin K, thiamin, or folic acid over five years of ambient temperature storage.

TA7 Human Exploration Destination Systems,TA7.4 Advanced Habitat Systems,H3.02Atmosphere Revitalization and Fire Recovery for Future Exploration Missions, MSFC," ARC, GRC, JSC, KSC","This topic seeks to develop targeted process technologies and equipment to advance the operability and reliability of atmosphere revitalization (AR) subsystems that enable crewed deep space exploration objectives. Highly reliable AR subsystem equipment and process technologies, supplemented by atmosphere decontamination equipment and methods, are necessary components to crewed deep space exploration mission success. While the International Space Station (ISS) AR subsystem equipment approaches many of the functional goals necessary for deep space exploration mission success, flight operational experience has identified areas for improvement in resource recovery and rapid atmosphere decontamination capabilities. Technologies related to resource recovery include gas compression and management as well as gas separations. Rapid atmosphere decontamination capabilities are needed to remove the functional burden for recovering from a contamination event, such as a fire or chemical spill, from the primary AR subsystem equipment. Details in each functional area of interest are provided by the following: Gas Compression and Management - NASA is seeking safe, compact, quiet, long-lived, and efficient ways to compress, store, and deliver gaseous oxygen and carbon dioxide within an AR subsystem. Also, methods to store, condition, and deliver reactant gases, primarily carbon dioxide, to carbon dioxide reduction process equipment are sought. Present AR equipment aboard ISS consists of power-intensive, noisy compressors that have service lives less than 2 years. Significant acoustic treatment is necessary to achieve NC-40 criteria. Applications for deep space exploration missions include but are not limited to production of high pressure oxygen for EVA use, and compression and storage of carbon dioxide for use in carbon dioxide reduction systems. Improvements in service life, reliability, and mechanical compression for atmospheric gas recharge to pressures up to 3,600 psia, including long life and reliability, and novel methods to increase tank storage capacity at lower pressures are of particular interest. Hydrogen Purification for Resource Recovery - Resource recovery and recycling is an enabling functional area for the AR subsystems needed for long-duration missions. For this purpose, NASA is interested in a regenerative separation technology to enable maximum hydrogen recovery from a stream containing water vapor (saturated), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrocarbons including methane, acetylene, ethane, and ethylene, among others. While a high quantity of methane in the hydrogen product stream is acceptable, and even desirable, the presence of CO, water, and other hydrocarbons is highly undesirable. Final gas composition must be >99% hydrogen with some allowable methane and the dewpoint must be less than -60 °C. System concepts must strive to minimize power, mass, and consumable requirements while maximizing efficiency, operational life, and reliability. Post-Fire Cabin Atmosphere Cleanup - A portable, self-contained fire and toxic atmosphere cleanup system is desired that can rapidly remove contaminants from a spacecraft volume, to quickly and effectively decontaminate cabin atmosphere after a fire. The capability to reduce starting concentrations by >80% within 15 minutes for a 100-m3 volume is desired. Methods have involved either deploying a filter assembly to the commode after a fire and using the commode fan as the source of airflow or attaching a series of filters to a portable fan using an adapter kit. Both methods result in low atmospheric scrubbing flow rates and significant time for deployment as well as limited capacity and non-specific scrubbing. Russian-provided portable equipment aboard the ISS provides 65 m3 /h flow through a replaceable cartridge. The equipment’s mass is 17 kg and the power consumption is 150 W. Filter service life is 7.5 hours. The dimensions are approximately 33 cm diameter and 35 cm tall. Future equipment must provide the rapid contamination reduction within the characteristic size and performance envelope of the Russian-developed portable scrubbing device. For each technical area, projects are sought to research and demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I that will develop a clear technical maturation path towards Phase II hardware development and demonstration. Phase II products must include a demonstration unit suitable for testing by NASA. Phase I Deliverables - Documentation, data, and feasibility assessment proving the proposed approach is suitable to develop the proposed product (at least TRL 3 at completion according to NPR 7123.1 TRL definition). A breadboard developmental unit is desirable. Phase II Deliverables - Functional engineering development unit at a minimum high fidelity breadboard (brassboard fidelity preferred), defined by NPR 7120.8, and technical maturity level 4 (TRL 4 defined by NPR 7123.1) of the proposed product, along with a full report of developmental and performance results, including drawings, analyses, and models as applicable. Opportunities and plans should also be identified and summarized for potential commercialization. Read less>>"

"TA8 Science Instruments, Observatories & Sensor Systems",TA8.1 Science Instruments,S2.01Proximity Glare Suppression for Astronomical Coronagraphy, JPL," ARC, GSFC","This subtopic addresses the unique problem of imaging and spectroscopic characterization of faint astrophysical objects that are located within the obscuring glare of much brighter stellar sources. Examples include planetary systems beyond our own, the detailed inner structure of galaxies with very bright nuclei, binary star formation, and stellar evolution. Contrast ratios of one million to ten billion over an angular spatial scale of 0.05-1.5 arcsec are typical of these objects. Achieving a very low background requires control of both scattered and diffracted light. The failure to control either amplitude or phase fluctuations in the optical train severely reduces the effectiveness of starlight cancellation schemes. This innovative research focuses on advances in coronagraphic instruments, starlight cancellation instruments, and potential occulting technologies that operate at visible and near infrared wavelengths. The ultimate application of these instruments is to operate in space as part of a future observatory mission. Measurement techniques include imaging, photometry, spectroscopy, and polarimetry. There is interest in component development and innovative instrument design, as well as in the fabrication of subsystem devices to include, but not limited to, the following areas: Starlight Suppression Technologies Image plane hybrid metal/dielectric, and polarization apodization masks in linear and circular patterns.

"TA8 Science Instruments, Observatories & Sensor Systems",TA8.1 Science Instruments,S2.02Precision Deployable Optical Structures and Metrology, JPL," GSFC, LaRC","Planned future NASA Missions in astrophysics, such as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and the New Worlds Technology Development Program (coronagraph, external occulter and interferometer technologies) will push the state of the art in current optomechanical technologies. Mission concepts for New Worlds science would require 10 - 30 m class, cost-effective telescope observatories that are diffraction limited at wavelengths from the visible to the far IR, and operate at temperatures from 4 - 300 K. In addition, ground based telescopes such as the Cerro Chajnantor Atacama Telescope (CCAT) requires similar technology development. The desired areal density is 1 - 10 kg/m2 with a packaging efficiency of 3-10 deployed/stowed diameter. Static and dynamic wavefront error tolerances to thermal and dynamic perturbations may be achieved through passive means (e.g., via a high stiffness system, passive thermal control, jitter isolation or damping) or through active opto-mechanical control. Large deployable multi-layer structures in support of sunshades for passive thermal control and 20m to 50m class planet finding external occulters are also relevant technologies. Potential architecture implementations must package into an existing launch volume, deploy and be self-aligning to the micron level. The target space environment is expected to be the Earth-Sun L2. This subtopic solicits proposals to develop enabling, cost effective component and subsystem technology for deploying large aperture telescopes with low cost. Research areas of interest include: Precision deployable structures and metrology for optical telescopes (e.g., innovative active or passive deployable primary or secondary support structures). Architectures, packaging and deployment designs for large sunshields and external occulters. In particular, important subsystem considerations may include: Innovative concepts for packaging fully integrated subsystems (e.g., power distribution, sensing, and control components). Mechanical, inflatable, or other precision deployable technologies. Thermally-stable materials (CTE < 1ppm) for deployable structures. Innovative systems, which minimize complexity, mass, power and cost. Innovative testing and verification methodologies. The goal for this effort is to mature technologies that can be used to fabricate 16 m class or greater, lightweight, ambient or cryogenic flight-qualified observatory systems. Proposals to fabricate demonstration components and subsystems with direct scalability to flight systems through validated models will be given preference. The target launch volume and expected disturbances, along with the estimate of system performance, should be included in the discussion. Proposals with system solutions for large sunshields and external occulters will also be accepted. A successful proposal shows a path toward a Phase II delivery of demonstration hardware scalable to 5 meter diameter for ground test characterization. Before embarking on the design and fabrication of complex space-based deployable telescopes, additional risk reduction in operating an actively controlled telescope in orbit is desired. To be cost effective, deployable apertures that conform to a cubesat (up to 3-U) or ESPA format are desired. Consequently, deployment hinge and latching concepts, buildable for these missions and scaleable to larger systems are desired. Such a system should allow <25 micron deployment repeatability and sub-micron stability for both thermal and mechanical on-orbit disturbances. A successful proposal would deliver a full-scale cubesat or ESPA ring compatible deployable aperture with mock optical elements.

"TA8 Science Instruments, Observatories & Sensor Systems",TA8.1 Science Instruments,S2.03 Advanced Optical Systems, MSFC," GSFC, JPL","his subtopic solicits solutions in the following areas: Optical Components, Coatings and Systems for potential x-ray missions. Optical Components, Coatings and Systems for potential UV/Optical missions. Proposals should show an understanding of one or more relevant science needs, and present a feasible plan to fully develop a technology and infuse it into a NASA program. The primary emphasis of this subtopic is to mature technologies needed to manufacture, test or operate complete mirror systems or telescope assemblies. Section 3 contains a detailed discussion on specific technologies which need developing for each area. The 2010 National Academy Astro2010 Decadal Report specifically identifies optical components and coatings as key technologies needed to enable several different future missions, including: Light-weight x-ray imaging mirrors for future large advanced x-ray observatories. Large aperture, light-weight mirrors for future UV/Optical telescopes. Broadband high reflectance coatings for future UV/Optical telescopes. The 2012 National Academy report “NASA Space Technology Roadmaps and Priorities” states that one of the top technical challenges in which NASA should invest over the next five years is developing a new generation of larger effective aperture, lower-cost astronomical telescopes that enable discovery of habitable planets, facilitate advances in solar physics, and enable the study of faint structures around bright objects. To enable this capability requires low-cost, ultra-stable, large-aperture, normal and grazing incidence mirrors with low mass-to-collecting area ratios. To enable these new astronomical telescopes, the report identifies three specific optical systems technologies: Active align/control of grazing-incidence imaging systems to achieve < 1 arc-second angular resolution. Active align/control of normal-incidence imaging systems to achieve 500 nm diffraction limit (40 nm rms wavefront error, WFE) performance. Normal incidence 4-meter (or larger) diameter 5 nm rms WFE (300 nm system diffraction limit) mirrors. Finally, impacting potential space telescopes, NASA is developing a heavy lift space launch system (SLS). An SLS with an 8 to 10 meter fairing and 80 to 100 mt capacity to LEO would enable extremely large space telescopes. Potential systems include 12 to 30 meter class segmented primary mirrors for UV/optical or infrared wavelengths and 8 to 16 meter class segmented x-ray telescope mirrors. These potential future space telescopes have very specific mirror technology needs. UV/optical telescopes (such as ATLAST-9 or ATLAST-16) require 1 to 3 meter class mirrors with < 5 nm rms surface figures. IR telescopes (such as SAFIR/CALISTO) require 2 to 3 to 8 meter class mirrors with cryo-deformations < 100 nm rms. X-ray telescopes (such as GenX) require 1 to 2 meter long grazing incidence segments with angular resolution < 0.5 arc-sec and surface micro-roughness < 0.5-nm rms. Technical Challenges: In all cases, the most important metric for an advanced optical system (after performance) is affordability or areal cost (cost per square meter of collecting aperture). Currently both x-ray and normal incidence space mirrors cost $4 million to $6 million per square meter of optical surface area. This research effort seeks a cost reduction for precision optical components by 5 to 50 times, to less than $1M to $100K/m2. Successful proposals shall provide a scale-up roadmap (including processing and infrastructure issues) for full scale space qualifiable flight optics systems. Material behavior, process control, active and/or passive optical performance, and mounting/deploying issues should be resolved and demonstrated. Optical Components, Coatings and Systems for Potential X-ray Missions Potential x-ray missions require: X-ray imaging telescopes with <1 arc-sec angular resolution and > 1 to 5 m2 collecting area. Multilayer high-reflectance coatings for hard x-ray mirrors (similar to NuSTAR). X-ray transmission and/or reflection gratings. Regarding x-ray telescope, multiple technologies are needed to enable < 1 arc-sec x-ray observatories. These include, but are not limited to: new materials such as silicon carbide, porous silicon, beryllium; improved techniques to manufacture (such as direct precision machining, rapid optical fabrication, slumping or replication technologies) 0.3 to 2 meter diameter mirror shells or segments; improved metrology, performance prediction and testing techniques; active control of mirror shape; new structures for holding and actively aligning of mirrors in a telescope assembly. For example, the Wide-Field X-Ray Telescope (WFXT) requires a 6 meter focal length x-ray mirror with 1 arc-sec resolution and 1 m2 of collecting area. One implementation of this mirror has 71 concentric full shell hyperbola/parabola pairs whose diameters range from 0.3 to 1.0 meter and whose length is 150 to 240 mm (this length is split between the H/P pair). Total mass for the integrated mirror system (shells and structure) is < 1000 kg. For individual mirror shells, axial slope errors should be ~ 1 arc-sec rms (~100 nm rms figure error for 20 mm spatial frequencies) and surface finish should be < 0.5 nm rms. Additionally, potential Heliophysics missions require a grazing incidence telescope with an effective collecting area of ~3 cm2 for 0.1 to 4 nm wavelengths, 4 meter effective focal length, 0.8 degree angle of incidence and surface roughness of 0.2 nm rms. Regarding x-ray coatings, future x-ray missions require multilayer depth gradient coatings with high broadband reflectivity for 5 to 80 keV energy photons. Regarding improved metrology and performance prediction, technology is needed to fully characterize x-ray mirrors (and mandrels) and predict their angular resolution performance. Potential solutions include (but are not limited to): both sub-aperture stitching (in the lateral direction) to acquire data over the entire optical surface, and merging/interpolating data with different spatial frequency domains. This can be done using different surface measuring instruments with different fields of view and resolutions. Successful proposals will demonstrate an ability to manufacture, test and control a prototype 0.25 to 0.5 meter diameter x-ray mirror assembly; or, to coat a 0.25 to 0.5 meter class representative optical component; or, to characterize and performance predict a 0.5 to 1.0 meter class x-ray mirror or mandrel. An ideal Phase I project would deliver a sub-scale component such as a 0.25 meter x-ray precision mirror; or demonstrate a prototype metrology system capable of characterizing the optical surface morphology of an x-ray component and predicting its angular performance. An ideal Phase II project would further advance the technology to produce a space-qualifiable 0.5 meter mirror, with a TRL in the 4 to 5 range; or deliver a metrology system capable of characterizing 0.5 to 1.0 meter class x-ray mirrors (or mandrels) and predicting their angular resolution performance. Both Phase I and Phase II deliverables would be accompanied by all necessary documentation, including the optical performance assessment and all data on processing and properties of its substrate materials. The Phase II would also include a mechanical and thermal stability analysis. Optical Components, Coatings and Systems for Potential UV/Optical Missions Potential UV/Optical missions require: Large aperture, light-weight mirrors. Broadband high reflectance coatings. Regarding large aperture mirrors, future UVOIR missions require 4 to 8 or 16 meter monolithic or segmented primary mirrors with < 10 nm rms surface figures. Mirror areal density depends upon available launch vehicle capacities to Sun-Earth L2 (i.e., 15 kg/m2 for a 5 m fairing EELV vs. 60 kg/m2 for a 10 m fairing SLS). Regarding broadband reflectance coating, future UVOIR missions require coatings with broadband reflectivity > 60% and uniform polarization from 90 nm to 2500 nm which can be deposited onto a 2 to 4 to 8 meter mirror substrate. Additionally, the coatings need to have > 90% reflectivity from 450 nm to 2500 nm. Future EUV missions require coatings with reflectivity > 90% from 6 nm to 200 nm which can be deposited onto mirror substrates as large as 2.4 meters in diameter. Successful proposals will demonstrate an ability to manufacture, test and control ultra-low-cost precision 0.25 to 0.5 meter optical systems; or to coat a 0.25 to 0.5 meter representative optical component. Potential solutions include, but are not limited to, new mirror materials such as silicon carbide, nanolaminates or carbon-fiber reinforced polymer; new fabrication processes such as direct precision machining, rapid optical fabrication, roller embossing at optical tolerances, slumping or replication technologies to manufacture 1 to 2 meter (or larger) precision quality mirrors or lens segments. Solutions include reflective, transmissive, diffractive or high order diffractive blazed lens optical components for assembly of large (16 to 32 meter) optical quality primary elements. Potential solutions to improve UV reflective coatings include, but are not limited to, investigations of new coating materials with promising UV performance; new deposition processes; and examination of handling processes, contamination control, and safety procedures related to depositing coatings, storing coated optics, and integrating coated optics into flight hardware. An ability to demonstrate optical performance on 2 to 3 meter class optical surfaces is important. An ideal Phase I deliverable would be a precision mirror of at least 0.25 meters; or a coated mirror of at least 0.25 meters. An ideal Phase II project would further advance the technology to produce a space-qualifiable mirror greater than 0.5 meters, with a TRL in the 4 to 5 range. Both Phase I and Phase II deliverables would be accompanied by all necessary documentation, including the optical performance assessment and all data on processing and properties of its substrate materials.

"TA8 Science Instruments, Observatories & Sensor Systems",TA8.3 Sensor Systems,A1.01Aviation External Hazard Sensor Technologies, LaRC," AFRC, GRC","NASA is concerned with the prevention of encounters with hazardous in-flight conditions and the mitigation of their effects when they do occur. Hazardous flight conditions of particular interest are: wake vortices, clear-air turbulence, in-flight icing, lightning, and low visibility. NASA is interested in new and innovative methods for detection, identification, evaluation, and monitoring of in-flight hazards to aviation. In the case of lightning, interest is centered on the mitigation and in-flight measurement of lightning damage, particularly to composite aircraft. NASA seeks to foster research and development that leads to innovative new technologies and methods, or significant improvements in existing technologies, for in-flight hazard avoidance and mitigation. Technologies may take the form of tools, models, techniques, procedures, substantiated guidelines, prototypes, and devices. Proposed products may be for retrofit into current aircraft or for installation in future aircraft. Both manned and unmanned aircraft are of interest. A key objective of the NASA Aviation Safety Program is to support the research of technology, systems, and methods that will facilitate transformation of the National Airspace System to Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). Additional information is available at (http://www.jpdo.gov(link is external)). The general approach to the development of airborne sensors for NextGen is to encourage the development of multi-use, adaptable, and effective sensors that will have a strong benefit to safety. The greatest impact will result from improved sensing capability in the terminal area, where higher density and more reliable operations are required for NextGen. Under this subtopic, proposals are invited that explore new and improved sensors and sensor systems for the detection and monitoring of hazards to aircraft before they are encountered. Approaches that use multiple sensors in combination to improve hazard detection and quantification of hazard levels are also of interest. With regard to hazardous lightning conditions, the emphasis is not on remote detection, but rather on developing systems that make aircraft more robust in a lightning environment or provide in-flight damage assessment or other hazard mitigating benefits. The design and development of composite materials and composite construction methods are not included in this subtopic. The scope of this subtopic does not include human factors and focused development of human interfaces, including displays and alerts. Primary emphasis is on airborne applications, but in some cases the development of ground-based sensor technology may be supported. Areas of particular interest to NASA at this time are described in more detail below. The list and details are provided as encouragement but are not intended to exclude other proposals that fit the scope of this subtopic. Lightning Lightning Strike Protection - NASA is investigating means for mitigating damage to aircraft, with a particular interest in protecting composite aircraft. Currently, an electrically-conductive screen protects composite aircraft by functioning as a Faraday shield and is intended to confine lightning and electromagnetic effects to the outside or outermost skin of the aircraft. The lightning strike protection system, hereafter referred to as the LSP, is incorporated in the coatings, layers, and structure that comprise the skin of the aircraft. NASA is most interested in LSP solutions that will be cost effective and light-weight. The design and development of composite materials and construction methods is out of scope for this subtopic. Mitigation of Lightning Strike Damage - NASA is seeking solutions that will provide better protection from lightning damage by directing attachment points or lightning currents to safe or less hazardous areas and by reducing the susceptibility of the aircraft to thermal or other damage due to strikes. In-flight Lightning Damage Measurement and Assessment - A typical commercial aircraft is struck by lightning about once per year. At this time, composite aircraft that are struck in-flight are inspected upon landing for a damage assessment. Such assessments may be time-consuming and difficult. Innovations that will provide a measurement or damage detection system in the LSP are solicited. The objective would be to achieve a capability to have damage detection and assessment in the aircraft that will provide immediate information to the flight crew after a lightning attachment. Polarimetric Radar Technology Polarimetric Antennas - Recent investigations indicate that polarimetric capability would provide a substantial advancement in airborne weather radar. Flat plate, slot antenna (single polarity) arrays currently in use are cost-effective, light-weight, and rugged. An innovative polarimetric antenna design that meets the same criteria would be a major step toward implementation of polarimetric radar. Existing commercial aircraft dictate the antenna system requirements, and new antenna designs should be suitable for retrofit. Innovative techniques, designs, or developments that lead to polarimetric antennas that are affordable and effective and can be retrofit to existing commercial aircraft are solicited. Turbulence and Wake Vortex Remote Detection of Kinetic Air Hazards - The class of hazards including wake vortices, turbulence, and other hazards associated with air motion is referred to as kinetic air hazards. Within this class, wakes and turbulence are the highest priorities; however, NASA is particularly interested in sensor systems that can detect multiple hazards and thus provide greater utility. For example, air data systems are at times disabled by icing, and a multi-function, multi-hazard sensor that includes a robust alternative air data source would be a great asset in such conditions. Airborne Detection of Wake Vortices - Airborne detection of wake vortices is considered challenging due to the fact that detection must be possible in nearly all weather conditions, in order to be practical, and because of the size and nature of the phenomena. In particular, NASA is interested in the ability to detect and measure wake vortex hazards for arbitrary viewing angles. Airborne Detection of Turbulence - NASA has made a major investment in the development of new and enhanced technologies to enable detection of turbulence to improve aviation safety. Progress has been made in efforts to quantify hazard levels from convectively induced turbulence events and to make these quantitative assessments available to civil and commercial aviation. NASA is interested in expanding these prior efforts to take advantage of the newly developing turbulence monitoring technologies, particularly those focused on clear air turbulence (CAT). NASA welcomes proposals that explore the methods, algorithms and quantitative assessment of turbulence for the purpose of increasing aviation safety and augmenting currently available data in support of NextGen operations.

"TA8 Science Instruments, Observatories & Sensor Systems",TA8.3 Sensor Systems,S1.01Lidar Remote Sensing Technologies, LaRC," GSFC, JPL","NASA recognizes the potential of lidar technology in meeting many of its science objectives by providing new capabilities or offering enhancements over current measurements of atmospheric and topographic parameters from ground, airborne, and space-based platforms. To meet NASA's requirements, advances are needed in state-of-the-art lidar technology with an emphasis on compactness, efficiency, reliability, lifetime, and high performance. Innovative lidar subsystem and component technologies systems that directly address the measurement of atmospheric constituents and surface topography of the Earth, Mars, the Moon, and other planetary bodies will be considered under this subtopic. Proposals relevant to the development of lidar instruments that can be used in planned missions or current technology programs are highly encouraged. Examples of planned missions and technology programs are: Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS). Aerosols-Clouds-Ecosystems (ACE). Doppler Wind Lidar (3D-WINDS). Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Ozone Lidar. Lidar for Surface Topography (LIST). Mars atmospheric sensing, atmospheric entry and descent sensors for Mars and Earth, and tracking large-scale water movement (GRACE-II). In addition, innovative technologies relevant to the NASA sub-orbital programs, such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Venture-class focusing on the studies of the Earth climate, carbon cycle, weather, and atmospheric composition, are being sought. Compact, high efficiency lidar instruments for deployment on unconventional platforms, such as balloon, small sat, and cube sat, are also considered and encouraged. The proposals should target advancement of lidar technologies for eventual space utilization. Phase I research should demonstrate the technical feasibility and show a path toward a Phase II prototype unit. Phase II prototypes should be capable of laboratory demonstration and preferably suitable for operation in the field from a ground-based station, an aircraft platform, or any science platform amply defended by the proposer. For the 2014 SBIR Program, we are soliciting the component and subsystem technologies described below. Solid state, single frequency, pulsed, laser transmitters operating in the 1.0 µm to1.7 µm range with a wall-plug efficiency of greater than 25% suitable for CO2 measurement, and free-space laser communication applications. The laser transmitters must be capable of generating frequency transform-limited pulses with a quality beam M2 of less than 1.5 with an approximately 20 W of average power. We are interested in two different regimes of repetition rates: from 5 kHz to 20 kHz, and from 20 Hz to 100 Hz. In addition, development of non-traditional optical amplifier architectures that yield optical efficiency of >70% are of interest. Compact and rugged single-frequency CW laser systems operating at 1.06 mm, 1.57 mm, 1.651 mm and 2.05 mm wavelengths suitable for precision space interferometry applications such as LISA, GRACE-II, and coherent detection lidars. The lasers must be developed with space environment considerations and demonstrate a clear path to space. Proposed lasers must be able to generate at least 20 mW of power with less than 10 kHz linewidth over a tunable range of about 50 nm. Systems must be highly wavelength stable and come with full supporting electronic systems for thermal and power control. Long wavelength solid state laser transmitter technology (e 10 µm) is needed for atmospheric lidar and possible terrain altimeter instruments for Venus. The highly dense atmosphere, volatile clouds, and thick scattering layers make this measurement a low probability event, but should be possible with significant pulse energies at long wavelengths. In combination of large, lightweight receiver, we can maximize the possibility of achieving a round trip remote sensing link from low Venus orbit. Minimum pulse energies of e 100 mJ are needed to reach the surface in the best conditions, such as with periodic holes and gaps in the clouds. Repetition rates of e 10Hz are desired for reasonable footprint spacing should a link be achieved. Ultra-low noise photo receiver modules, operating either at 1.6 or 2.0 micron wavelengths for measuring CO2 concentration, comprising of the detection device, complete Dewar/cooling systems, and associated amplifiers. General requirements are: large active detection diameter (>200 micron), high quantum efficiency (>85%), noise equivalent power of the order of 10-14 W/sqrt(Hz), and bandwidth greater than 20 MHz. Lightweight scanning telescopes capable of a conical pattern with nadir angle fixed in the range of 30 to 45 degrees. The lightweight scanning telescopes are sought for both direct and heterodyne detection wind lidars and tropospheric ozone lidars. For winds, the direct detection lidar operates in 355 nm to 1064 nm wavelength region and the heterodyne detection lidar in 1550 nm to 2050 nm. For ozone, these systems should operate between 280-300 nm. The ozone systems are designed to support NASA's TOLNet network providing data for satellite validation and the study of anthropogenic pollution. High optical efficiency and near diffraction-limited performance are among major considerations. The proposer must show a clear path to space by addressing scalability to apertures greater than 1 m, materials (e.g., substrates and coatings) selection compatible with a space environment, and thermally-stable design. Phase II should result in a prototype unit capable of demonstration in a high-altitude aircraft environment, with aperture of at least 10 inches in diameter. Read less>>"

"TA8 Science Instruments, Observatories & Sensor Systems",TA8.3 Sensor Systems,S1.09Atomic Interferometry, JPL, GSFC,"Recent developments of laser control and manipulation of atoms have led to a new type of precision inertial force and gravity sensors based on atom interferometry. Atom interferometers exploit the quantum mechanical wave nature of atomic particles and quantum gases for sensitive interferometric measurements. Ground-based laboratory experiments and instruments have already demonstrated beyond the state of the art performances of accelerometer, gyroscope, and gravity measurements. Microgravity environment in space provides opportunities for further drastic improvements in sensitivity and precision. Such inertial sensors will have great potential to provide new capabilities for NASA Earth and planetary gravity measurements, for spacecraft inertial navigation and guidance, and for gravitational wave detection and test of properties of gravity in space. Currently the most mature development of atom interferometers as measurement instruments are those based on light pulsed atom interferometers with freefall cold atoms.

Development of in-situ heat flux sensors, surface recession diagnostics, and in-depth or interface thermal response measurement devices for use on rigid and/or flexible ablative materials. In-situ heat flux sensors and surface recession diagnostics tools are needed for flight systems to provide better traceability from the modeling and design tools to actual performance. The resultant data will lead to higher fidelity design tools, risk reduction, decreased heat shield mass and increases in direct payload. The heat flux sensors should be accurate within 20%, surface recession diagnostic sensors should be accurate within 10%, and any temperature sensors should be accurate within 5% of actual values. Non Destructive Evaluation (NDE) tools for evaluation of bondline and in-depth integrity for light weight rigid and/or flexible ablative materials. Non Destructive Evaluation (NDE) tools are sought to verify design requirements are met during manufacturing and assembly of the heat shield, e.g., verifying that anisotropic materials have been installed in their proper orientation, that the bondline as well as the TPS materials have the proper integrity and are free of voids or defects. Void and/or defect detection requirements will depend upon the materials being inspected. Typical internal void detection requirements are on the order of 6 mm, and bondline defect detection requirements are on the order of 25.4 mm by 25.4 mm by the thickness of the adhesive. Advances are sought in ablation modeling, including radiation, convection, gas surface interactions, pyrolysis, coking, and charring for low and mid-density fiber based (woven or felt) ablative materials. There is a specific need for improved models for low and mid density as well as multi-layered charring ablators (with different chemical composition in each layer). Consideration of the non-equilibrium states of the pyrolysis gases and the surface thermochemistry, as well as the potential to couple the resulting models to a computational fluid dynamics solver, should be included in the modeling efforts. Starting Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) of 2-3 or higher are sought. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards Phase II hardware/software demonstration with delivery of a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase I Deliverables - Feasibility study, including simulations and measurements, proving the proposed approach to develop a given product (TRL 3). Small samples and initial test data may be provided to demonstrate feasibility. Development of the verification matrix of measurements to be performed at the end of Phase II, along with specific quantitative pass-fail ranges for each quantity listed. Phase II Deliverables - Working engineering model of proposed product, along with full report of development and measurements, including populated verification matrix from Phase I (TRL 4-5). Opportunities and plans should also be identified and summarized for potential commercialization. Read less>>"

This call is not for sensor processing algorithms. Sensing technologies are desired that determine the entry point of the spacecraft in the Mars atmosphere; provide inputs to systems that control spacecraft trajectory, speed, and orientation to the surface; locate the spacecraft relative to the Martian surface; evaluate potential hazards at the landing site; and determine when the spacecraft has touched down. Appropriate sensing technologies for this subtopic should provide measurements of physical forces or properties that support some aspect of EDL operations.

Products or technologies are sought that can be made compatible with the environmental conditions of spaceflight, the rigors of landing on the Martian surface, and planetary protection requirements. Successful candidate sensor technologies can address this call by: Providing critical measurements during the entry phase (e.g., pressure and/or temperature sensors embedded into the aeroshell). Improving the accuracy of measurements needed for guidance decisions (e.g., surface relative velocities, altitudes, orientation, localization). Extending the range over which such measurements are collected (e.g., providing a method of imaging through the aeroshell or terrain-relative navigation that does not require imaging through the aeroshell). Enhancing situational awareness during landing by identifying hazards (rocks, craters, slopes) and/or providing indications of approach velocities and touchdown. Substantially reducing the amount of external processing needed to calculate the measurements. Significantly reducing the impact of incorporating such sensors on the spacecraft in terms of volume, mass, placement, or cost. For a sample-return mission, monitoring local environmental (weather) conditions on the surface prior to landing of a ""fetch"" rover or launch of a planetary ascent vehicle, via appropriate low-mass sensors.

"TA11 Modeling, Simulation, Information Technology and Processing",TA11.1 Computing,S5.01Technologies for Large-Scale Numerical Simulation, ARC, GSFC,"NASA scientists and engineers are increasingly turning to large-scale numerical simulation on supercomputers to advance understanding of complex Earth and astrophysical systems, and to conduct high-fidelity aerospace engineering analyses. The goal of this subtopic is to increase the mission impact of NASA's investments in supercomputing systems and associated operations and services. Specific objectives are to: Decrease the barriers to entry for prospective supercomputing users. Minimize the supercomputer user's total time-to-solution (e.g., time to discover, understand, predict, or design). Increase the achievable scale and complexity of computational analysis, data ingest, and data communications. Reduce the cost of providing a given level of supercomputing performance on NASA applications. Enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of NASA's supercomputing operations and services. Expected outcomes are to improve the productivity of NASA's supercomputing users, broaden NASA's supercomputing user base, accelerate advancement of NASA science and engineering, and benefit the supercomputing community through dissemination of operational best practices. The approach of this subtopic is to seek novel software and hardware technologies that provide notable benefits to NASA's supercomputing users and facilities, and to infuse these technologies into NASA supercomputing operations. Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, NASA's high-end computing (HEC) projects - the High End Computing Capability project at Ames and the Scientific Computing project at Goddard. To assure maximum relevance to NASA, funded SBIR contracts under this subtopic should engage in direct interactions with one or both HEC projects, and with key HEC users where appropriate. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and NASA relevance during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration. Offerors should demonstrate awareness of the state-of-the-art of their proposed technology, and should leverage existing commercial capabilities and research efforts where appropriate. Open source software and open standards are strongly preferred. Note that the NASA supercomputing environment is characterized by: HEC systems operating behind a firewall to meet strict IT security requirements. Communication-intensive applications. Massive computations requiring high concurrency. Complex computational workflows and immense datasets. The need to support hundreds of complex application codes - many of which are frequently updated by the user/developer. As a result, solutions that involve the following must clearly explain how they would work in the NASA environment: Grid computing. Web services. Client-server models. Embarrassingly parallel computations. Technologies that require significant application re-engineering. Projects need not benefit all NASA HEC users or application codes, but demonstrating applicability to an important NASA discipline, or even a key NASA application code, could provide significant value. Specific technology areas of interest: Efficient Computing - In spite of the rapidly increasing capability and efficiency of supercomputers, NASA's HEC facilities cannot purchase, power, and cool sufficient HEC resources to satisfy all user demands. This subtopic element seeks dramatically more efficient and effective supercomputing approaches in terms of their ability to supply increased HEC capability or capacity per dollar and/or per Watt for real NASA applications. Examples include: Novel computational accelerators and architectures. Cloud supercomputing with high performance interconnects (e.g., InfiniBand). Enhanced visualization technologies. Improved algorithms for key codes. Power-aware ""Green"" computing technologies and techniques. Approaches to effectively manage and utilize many-core processors including algorithmic changes, compiler techniques and runtime systems. User Productivity Environments - The user interface to a supercomputer is typically a command line in a text window. This subtopic element seeks more intuitive, intelligent, user-customizable, and integrated interfaces to supercomputing resources, enabling users to more completely leverage the power of HEC to increase their productivity. Such an interface could enhance many essential supercomputing tasks: accessing and managing resources, training, getting services, developing and porting codes (e.g., debugging and performance analysis), running computations, managing files and data, analyzing and visualizing results, transmitting data, collaborating, etc. Ultra-Scale Computing - Over the next decade, the HEC community faces great challenges in enabling its users to effectively exploit next-generation supercomputers featuring massive concurrency to the tune of millions of cores. To overcome these challenges, this subtopic element seeks ultra-scale computing technologies that enable resiliency/fault-tolerance in extreme-scale (unreliable) systems both at job startup and during execution. Also of interest are system and software co-design methodologies, to achieve performance and efficiency synergies. Finally, tools are sought that facilitate verification and validation of ultra-scale applications and systems. Read less>>"

In this call, innovations with an emphasis on aircraft propulsion are solicited in the following areas: Noise Reduction Advanced liners including broadband liners (i.e., liners capable of appreciable sound absorption over at least two octaves), and low-frequency liners (i.e., liners with optimum absorption frequencies half of the current ones but without increasing the liner depth).

"TA11 Modeling, Simulation, Information Technology and Processing",TA11.2 Modeling,A3.05Physics-Based Conceptual Design Tools, LaRC, GRC,"NASA continues to investigate the potential of advanced, innovative propulsion and aircraft concepts to improve fuel efficiency and reduce the environmental footprint of future generations of commercial transports across the subsonic and supersonic flight regimes. Conceptual design and analysis of unconventional vehicle concepts and technologies is used for technology portfolio investment planning, development of advanced concepts to provide technology pull, and independent technical assessment of new concepts. The agency’s systems analysts need to have the best conceptual design/analysis tools possible to support these efforts. Substantial progress has been recently made in incorporating more physics-based analysis tools in the conceptual design process and NASA has developed a capability that integrates several analysis tools and models in engineering frameworks, such as ModelCenter and OpenMDAO. The current focus is instead on filling remaining capability gaps in specific design disciplines. As such, the purpose of this subtopic is to solicit proposals for innovative solutions which address the problem of rapidly obtaining reasonably accurate airframe weight and center of gravity estimates during the conceptual design of unconventional configurations. Historically, empirical and semi-empirical weight estimation methods have been utilized during the conceptual design phase. These methods work well for the conceptual design of conventional vehicles with parameters that reside within the historical databases used to develop the methodologies. These methods are not well suited, however, for unconventional vehicle concepts, or even conventional concepts which reside outside of the database (for example, very high aspect ratio swept wings). Developing higher order, more accurate tools suitable for conceptual design is a difficult challenge. The first issue is analysis turnaround time. To perform the configuration trades and optimization typical of conceptual design, runtimes measured in seconds or minutes, instead of hours or days, are required. However, rapid analysis turnaround time alone is insufficient. To be suitable for conceptual design, tools and methods are needed which accurately predict the “as-built” characteristics. Because it is not possible to model every detail of the design and account for all the underlying physics in the problem formulation, it is difficult to predict the “as-built” characteristics with physics-based methods alone. What is usually required is a combination of these methods with some semi-empirical corrections. A final challenge in conceptual design is a lack of detailed design information. Lower order, empirical-based methods often require only gross design parameters as inputs. High-order, physics-based methods currently require detailed design knowledge to be useful. For example, whereas semi-empirical weight prediction tools provide estimates for wing weight without needing a structural layout, such detail is necessary to successfully utilize finite-element analysis tools. This gap between the analysis capability and the maturity of the design being analyzed currently limits the usefulness of high order analysis in conceptual design. Physics-based tools for conceptual design are needed which are consistent with the amount of design knowledge that is available at the conceptual design stage. Specifically for FY 2014, desired capabilities include the following: New weight estimation relationships valid for wing and/or fuselage geometries outside of current historical databases. Increased fidelity loads generation. Engineering based weight estimation techniques for systems, equipment, and operational items. Read less>>"
"TA11 Modeling, Simulation, Information Technology and Processing",TA11.2 Modeling,Z1.04Modeling and Measurements for Propulsion and Power, GRC," ARC, MSFC","To reduce the development time of advanced future systems needed for space exploration, physics-based modeling tools are sought for: Electrochemical systems such as battery chemistries with “beyond Lithium ion” expected specific energies, proton exchange membrane and solid oxide fuel cells and electrolyzers, and chemical sensors for safety and operational monitoring. Electric propulsion systems such as Hall thrusters, nested Hall thrusters, ion engines, electrospray propulsion, and micro-propulsion. Nuclear power and propulsion systems such as 1kW-class, 10kW-class, and 100kW-class fission reactors, and nuclear thermal propulsion systems. In each case, the emphasis is on determining performance-limiting features and determining potential means to overcome limitations. Either Dcomponents or full systems can be targeted.

"TA11 Modeling, Simulation, Information Technology and Processing",TA11.2 Modeling,S5.04Integrated Science Mission Modeling, GSFC," ARC, JPL","NASA seeks innovative systems modeling methods and tools to: Define, develop and execute future science missions, many of which are likely to feature designs and operational concepts that will pose significant challenges to existing approaches and applications. Enable disciplined system analysis for the ongoing management and decision support of the space science technology portfolio, particularly with regard to understanding technology alternatives, relationships, priorities, timing, availability, down-selection, maturation, investment needs, system engineering considerations, and cost-to-benefit ratios; to examine ""what-if"" scenarios; and to facilitate multidisciplinary assessment, coordination, and integration of the technology roadmaps as a whole. Use of System Modeling Language (SysML) is encouraged but not required. SysML is a general purpose graphical modeling language for analyzing, designing and verifying complex systems that may include hardware, software, information, personnel, procedures and facilities. As a language, SysML represents requirements, structure, behavior, and equations in nine different diagram types, and can represent both hardware and software models. The language can be extended to provide metamodels for different disciplines, and is supported by multiple commercial tools. SysML is finding increased use throughout the agency to support systems engineering and analysis. Specific areas of interest include the following: Integration of system and mission modeling tools with high-fidelity multidisciplinary design and modeling tools, supporting efficient analysis methods that accommodate uncertainty, multiple objectives, and large-scale systems - This requires the development of robust interfaces between SysML and other tools, including CAD/CAE/PDM/PLM applications, used to support NASA science mission development, implementation and operations. The objective is to produce a unified environment supporting mixed systems-level and detailed analysis during any lifecycle phase, and rapid analysis of widely varying concepts/configurations using mixed-fidelity models, including geometry/mesh-based models when required. The human interface for such a system could be a ""dashboard"" (web-based is highly desirable) which initially allows for monitoring of the dataflow across a heterogeneous set of tools and finally allows for control of the data flow between the variety of applications. Modeling and rapid integration of programmatic, operational, and risk elements - Fully integrated system model representations must include non-physics based constructs such as cost, schedule, risk, operations, and organizational model elements. Novel methods and tools to model these system attributes are critical. In addition, approaches to integrate these in a meaningful way with other system model elements are needed. Methods that consider the development of these models as by-products of a collaborative and/or concurrent design process are particularly valuable. Library of SysML models of NASA related systems - Using a library of SysML models, engineers will be able to design their systems by reusing a set of existing models. Too often, these engineers have to begin from scratch the design of the systems. A library of verified and validated models would provide a way for the engineers to design a new spacecraft by assembling existing models that are domain specific, and therefore easy to adapt to the target system. In order to provide for seamless integration between SysML models each model must identify its level of abstraction both in terms of the modeling of time (progression: no ordering of events, qualitative ordering of events, metric time ordering of events) and the modeling of space (progression: lumped parameters models, distributed parameter models). Such levels of abstraction ""certificates"" for SysML will help determine integration interface requirements between any two models. Profiles for spacecraft, space robotics, and scientific instruments - Profiles provide a means of tailoring SysML for particular purposes. Extensions of the language can be inserted. This allows an organization to create domain specific constructs which extend existing SysML modeling elements. By developing profiles for NASA domains such as Spacecraft, Space Robotics and Scientific Instruments, powerful mechanisms will be available to NASA systems engineers for designing future space systems. Requirements Modeling - SysML offers requirements modeling capabilities, thus providing ways to visualize important requirements relationships. There is a need to combine traditional requirements management, supported by tools including but not limited to DOORS and CRADLE, and SysML requirements modeling in a standardized and sustainable way. Functional Modeling - The intermediate data products between requirements and specification are detailed functional models that identify all of the functions required to achieve the mission profile(s). There is a critical need to model this layer as it is a key data product to provide traceability between requirements and implementation. Model and Modeling Process Synthesis - As model-based design broadens and integrates larger and more complex models, methods for how to sequence and operate the design synthesis, evaluation (e.g., V&V) and elaboration process will become more important, as will considerations of how model-based processes are made compatible with existing review and development cycles.

"TA11 Modeling, Simulation, Information Technology and Processing",TA11.2 Modeling,S5.05Fault Management Technologies, MSFC," ARC, JPL","As science missions are given increasingly complex goals and have more pressure to reduce operations costs, system autonomy increases. Fault Management (FM) is one of the key components of system autonomy. FM consists of the operational mitigations of spacecraft failures. It is implemented with spacecraft hardware, on-board autonomous software that controls hardware, software, information redundancy, and ground-based software and operations procedures. Many recent Science Mission Directorate (SMD) missions have encountered major cost overruns and schedule slips during test and verification of FM functions. These overruns are due to a lack of understanding of FM functions early in the mission definition cycles and to FM architectures that do not provide attributes of transparency, verifiability, fault isolation capability, or fault coverage. The NASA FM Handbook is under development to improve the FM design, development, verification and validation and operations processes. FM approaches, architectures, and tools are needed to improve early understanding of needed FM capabilities by project managers and FM engineers and to improve the efficiency of implementing and testing FM. Specific objectives are to: Improve the ability to predict FM system complexity and estimate development and operations costs. Enable cost-effective FM design architectures and operations. Determine completeness and appropriateness of FM designs and implementations. Decrease the labor and time required to develop and test FM models and algorithms. Improve visualization of the full FM design across hardware, software, and operations procedures. Determine extent of testing required, completeness of verification planned, and residual risk resulting from incomplete coverage. Increase data integrity between multi-discipline tools. Standardize metrics and calculations across FM, SE, S&MA and operations disciplines. Increase reliability of FM systems. Expected outcomes are better estimation and control of FM complexity and development costs, improved FM designs, and accelerated advancement of FM tools and techniques. The approach of this subtopic is to seek the right balance between sufficient reliability and cost appropriate to the mission type and risk posture. Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, SMD missions. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and NASA relevance during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration. Offerors should demonstrate awareness of the state-of-the-art of their proposed technology, and should leverage existing commercial capabilities and research efforts where appropriate. Specific technology in the forms listed below is needed to increase delivery of high quality FM systems. These approaches, architectures and tools must be consistent with and enable the NASA FM Handbook concepts and processes: FM Design Tools - System modeling and analyses significantly contributes to the quality of FM design; however, the time it takes to translate system design information into system models often decreases the value of the modeling and analysis results. Examples of enabling techniques and tools are modeling automation, spacecraft modeling libraries, expedited algorithm development, sensor placement analyses, and system model tool integration. FM Visualization Tools - FM systems incorporate hardware, software, and operations mechanisms. The ability to visualize the full FM system and the contribution of each mechanism to protecting mission functions and assets is critical to assessing the completeness and appropriateness of the FM design to the mission attributes (mission type, risk posture, operations concept, etc.). Fault trees and state transition diagrams are examples of visualization tools that could contribute to visualization of the full FM design. FM Verification and Validation Tools - As complexity of spacecraft and systems increases, the extensiveness of testing required to verify and validate FM implementations can be resource intensive. Automated test case development, false positive/false negative test tools, model verification and validation tools, and test coverage risk assessments are examples of contributing technologies. FM Design Architectures - FM capabilities may be implemented through numerous system, hardware, and software architecture solutions. The FM architecture trade space includes options such as embedded in the flight control software or independent onboard software; on board versus ground-based capabilities; centralized or distributed FM functions; sensor suite implications; integration of multiple FM techniques; innovative software FM architectures implemented on flight processors or on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs); and execution in real-time or off-line analysis post-operations. Alternative architecture choices could help control FM system complexity and cost and could offer solutions to transparency, verifiability, and completeness challenges. Multi-discipline FM Interoperation - FM designers, Systems Engineering, Safety and Mission Assurance, and Operations perform analyses and assessments of reliabilities, failure modes and effects, sensor coverage, failure probabilities, anomaly detection and response, contingency operations, etc. The relationships between multi-discipline data and analyses are inconsistent and misinterpreted. Resources are expended either in effort to resolve disconnects in data and analyses or worse, reduced mission success due to failure modes that were overlooked. Solutions that address data integrity, identification of metrics, and standardization of data products, techniques and analyses will reduce cost and failures. Read less>>"

For this topic, we are especially interested in automated discovery of previously unknown precursors to aviation safety incidents involving human - automation interaction. We expect to gain knowledge on latent deficiencies in crew training, communication, and operations that is of paramount importance to future SSAT project goals and objectives. The incorporation of human performance will be invaluable to the success of this effort, and as such it will be important to use heterogeneous data from varied sources that are matched on a per-flight basis with flight-recorded data, such as radar track data, airport information, weather data, flight crew schedule information, maintenance information, and Air Safety Reports. This topic will develop revolutionary and first-of-a-kind methods and tools that incorporate the limitations of human performance throughout the design lifecycle of human-automation systems to increase safety and reduce validation costs in NextGen. The focus of this effort will be from the aircraft-level to fleet level and above.

One area of interest is new decision support tools and systems for a variety of ecological applications such as managing coastal environments, natural resources or responding to natural disasters. Currently, creating decision support tools (DST) that effectively utilize remote sensing data requires significant efforts by experts in multiple domains. This creates a barrier to the widespread use of Earth observations by state and local governments, businesses, and the public. This subtopic aims to democratize the creation of Earth science driven decision support tools and to unleash a creative explosion of DST development that significantly increases the return on investment for Earth science missions. Specifically, this subtopic develops core capabilities that can be integrated to build multiple remote sensing driven DSTs customized to the requirements of different users in varied fields. Proven development and commercialization strategies will be used to meet these objectives. Similar to Eclipse, this subtopic will create an open-source DST development framework that enables components from multiple providers to be seamlessly integrated. This subtopic will also create software components that plug into the framework and open source tools that help users create new components. The components will provide functionality ranging from basic operations, such as retrieval of data meeting user-specified criteria from online repositories and visualization, to sophisticated data processing and analysis algorithms, such as atmospheric correction, data fusion, computational model interfaces, and machine learning based quality control. To expedite DST development and deployment by knowledgeable users, this subtopic seeks an open source graphical workflow tool, similar to Labview or Simulink, which enables well informed users to quickly create a functional DST from a catalog of software components. Ultimately, a more sophisticated graphical workflow development tool, similar to MIT’s Scratch would enforce functionally, but not necessarily logically, “correct by construction” rules that would enable a broad population of people to successfully create DSTs. Open source and commercial components, as well as services, will be available through an online “store” similar to iTunes or Google Play. The framework, components and resulting DSTs should be able to run in a commercial cloud such as Amazon EC2 or Google Compute Engine. Cloud enabled components and DSTs, those that can intelligently take advantage of flexible computing resources for processing, analysis, visualization, optimization, etc. are highly desired. Ideally, users should be able to create, configure deploy DSTs, and view outputs such as status, reports, alerts, plots, maps, etc. via desktop computers (Windows 7 and OS X) as well as tablet and smart phones running recent versions of Android (4.0 and later) and iOS (5.0 and later).

"TA11 Modeling, Simulation, Information Technology and Processing",TA11.4 Information Processing,"S5.03Algorithms and Tools for Science Data Processing, Discovery and Analysis, in State-of-the-Art Data Environments", GSFC,,"The size of NASA's observational data sets is growing dramatically as new missions come on line. In addition, NASA scientists continue to generate new models that regularly produce data sets of hundreds of terabytes or more. It is growing ever increasingly difficult to manage all of the data through its full lifecycle, as well as provide effective data analytical methods to analyze the large amount of data. For example, the HyspIRI mission is expected to produce an average science data rate of 800 million bits per second (Mbps), JPSS-1 will be 300 Mbps and NPP is already producing 300 Mbps, compared to 150 Mbps for the EOS-Terra, Aqua and Aura missions. Other examples are SDO with a rate of 150 Mbps and 16.4 Gigabits for a single image from the HiRise camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). This subtopic area seeks innovation and unique approaches to solve issues associated around the use of ""Big Data"" within NASA. The emphasis of this subtopic is on tools that leverage existing systems, interfaces, and infrastructure, where it exists and where appropriate. Reuse of existing NASA assets is strongly encouraged. Specifically, innovations are being sought in the following areas: Parallel Processing for Data Analytics - Open source tools like the Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS) have shown promise for use in simple MapReduce operations to analyze model and observation data. In addition to HDFS, there is a rapid emergence and adoption of cloud software packages integrated with object stores, such as OpenStack and Swift. The goal is to accelerate these types of open source tools for use with binary structured data from observations and model output using MapReduce or a similar paradigm. High Performance File System Abstractions - NASA scientists currently use a large number of existing applications for data analysis, such as GrADS, python scripts, and more, that are not compatible with an object storage environment. If data were stored within an object storage environment, these applications would not be able to access the data. Many of these applications would require a substantial amount of investment to enable them to use object storage file systems. Therefore, a file system abstraction, such as FUSE (file system in user space) is needed to facilitate the use of existing data analysis applications with an object storage environment. The goal is to make a FUSE-like file system abstraction robust, reliable, and highly performing for use with large NASA data sets. Data Management of Large-Scale Scientific Repositories - With increasing size of scientific repositories comes an increasing demand for using the data in ways that may never have been imagined when the repository was conceived. The goal is to provide capabilities for the flexible repurposing of scientific data, including large-scale data integration, aggregation, representation, and distribution to emerging user communities and applications. Server Side Data Processing - Large data repositories make it necessary for analytical codes to migrate to where the data are stored. Hadoop does that at the level of a single HDFS. In a densely networked world of geographically distributed repositories, tiered intermediation is needed. The goal is to provide support for migratable codes and analytical outputs as first class objects within a provenance-oriented data management cyberinfrastructure. Techniques for Data Analysis and Visualization - New methods for data analytics that scale to extremely large data sets are necessary for data mining, searching, fusion, subsetting, discovery, visualization, and more. In addition, new algorithms and methods are needed to look for unknown correlations across large, distributed scientific data sets. The goal is to increase the scientific value of model and observation data by making analysis easier and higher performing. Among others, some of the topics of interest are: Techniques for automated derivation of analysis products such as machine learning for extraction of features in large image datasets (e.g., volcanic thermal measurement, plume measurement, automated flood mapping, disturbance mapping, change detection, etc.). Workflows for automated data processing, interpretation, and distribution. Accelerated Large Scale Data Movement - There are a multitude of large distributed data stores across NASA that includes both observation and model data. The movement of data across the network must be optimized to take full advantage of large-scale data analytics, especially when comparing model to observation data. The goal is to optimize data movement in the following ways: Accelerate and make it easier to move data over the wide area to facilitate large-scale data management and analysis. Optimize the movement of data within more local environments, such as the usage of Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) within HDFS. Virtualization of high-speed network interfaces for use within cloud environments. Research proposed to this subtopic should demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I, and in partnership with scientists, show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration, with significant communication with missions and programs to ensure a successful Phase III infusion. It is highly desirable that the proposed projects lead to software that is infused into NASA programs and projects. Tools and products developed under this subtopic may be used for broad public dissemination or within a narrow scientific community. These tools can be plug-ins or enhancements to existing software, on-line data/computing services, or new stand-alone applications or web services, provided that they promote interoperability and use standard protocols, file formats and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) or prevalent applications.

They are metastable, resulting in manufacturing challenges as well as post processing and machining challenges, especially when scaling these materials. If BMGs can be scaled up to usable sheets (sizes greater than 150 mm wide), these materials see a greater infusion threshold in aerospace and defense applications. Specific applications for BMG sheets include MMOD shielding and multifunctional structures; casings and structural components on launch vehicles and habitats. BMG alloys (to include but not limited to Al-based, Zr-, Mg-, Fe-, etc.) are desired in sheet form at a width >150 mm, a uniform thickness nominally between 0.1 and 1 mm, a length > 2 x width to continuous. In addition to BMG alloy sheets, the development of BMG composite sheets consisting of an amorphous matrix phase reinforced with soft, crystalline dendrites which improve the composite’s toughness and ductility are also desired. BMG composite sheets at a width >150 mm, a uniform thickness nominally between 0.1 and 1 mm, a length > 2 x width to continuous. The properties of the amorphous metal can thus be tuned by the second phase. Strength, hardness, ductility, fatigue life, toughness, density, thermal expansion, thermal diffusivity, among others, can all be adjusted in these amorphous metal composites. Special emphasis is placed on new processes for fabricating large BMG alloy and BMG composite sheets (width >150 mm, uniform thickness nominally between 0.1 and 1 mm, length > 2 x width to continuous) of bulk metallic glass alloys and advanced low-density thin ply, hybrid carbon fiber/BMG unidirectional impregnated tapes at widths greater than 75 mm.

Material should be delivered to the sponsor for evaluation. Plans for meeting dimensional goals, measuring manufacturing characteristics including but not limited to thickness, width, fraction or percent crystallinity, porosity or other defects, and evaluating manufacturing capability including but not limited to capacity/lead time, yield, cost reduction and process improvement opportunities to be reported at the conclusion of phase I. A Phase II effort should demonstrate the manufacturing capability from Phase I that produces a BMG alloy and/or BMG composite sheet with a width >150 mm, uniform thickness nominally between 0.1 and 1 mm, length > 2 x width to continuous). The sheet should then be post processed and formed into a complex structural component from either/or of the large sheets of bulk metallic glass alloys and/or advanced low-density thin ply, hybrid carbon fiber/BMG unidirectional impregnated tapes at widths greater than 75 mm. Manufacturing variability of critical characteristics, including but not limited to thickness, width, fraction or percent crystallinity, porosity or other defects, should be measured.

NASA has a vital interest in developing much larger arrays over the next 20 years with up to 4000 m2 of deployed area (1 MW) for exploration missions using solar electric propulsion (SEP). Scaling up solar array deployed surface area by more than an order-of-magnitude will require game changing innovations. In particular, novel flexible-substrate designs are needed that minimize structural mass and packaging volume while maximizing deployment reliability, deployed stiffness, deployed strength, and longevity. Most of the mass savings in these very large future arrays will probably come from improvements to solar array supporting structures, not from improvements in the solar cells mounted on the arrays. NASA is currently developing solar array systems for SEP in the 30-50 kW power range. This SBIR subtopic seeks innovative structures and materials technologies and capabilities for the next generation of lightweight solar arrays beyond 50 kW. Technologies are needed for the design and verification of large deployable solar arrays with: 200-400 m2 of deployed area (50-100 kW) in 3-5 years. 400-1200 m2 of deployed area (100-300 kW) in 5-10 years. 1200-4000 m2 of deployed area (300-1000 kW) in 10-20 years. These deployed areas are typically divided between two solar array wings, with each wing requiring half of the specified area. This subtopic seeks innovations in the following areas for future large solar array structures: Novel design, packaging, deployment, and in-space manufacturing and assembly concepts. Lightweight, compact components including booms, ribs, substrates, and mechanisms. Validated modeling, analysis, and simulation techniques. Ground and in-space test methods.

Deployment reliability > 0.999. Deployed stiffness > 0.1 Hz. Deployed strength > 0.2 g (all directions). Lifetime > 5 years. Variations of NASA’s in-house large solar array concept referred to as the Government Reference Array (GRA) could be used for design, analysis, and hardware studies. Improved packaging, joints, deployment methods, etc. to enable GRA-type solar arrays up to 4000 m2 in size (1 MW) with up to 250 W/kg and 60 kW/m3 BOL are of special interest. The GRA is described in Reference 2. In Phase I, contractors should prove the feasibility of proposed innovations using suitable analyses and tests.

Examples of possible system are: Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW)-based sensors, passive wireless sensor-tags, flexible sensors for highly curved surfaces direct-write film sensors, and others. Damage detection modes include leak detection, ammonia detection, micrometeoroid impact and others. Reduction in the complexity of standard wires and connectors and enabling sensing functions in locations not normally accessible with previous technologies is also desirable. Proposed techniques should be capable of long term service with little or no intervention. Sensor systems should be capable of identifying material state awareness and distinguish aging related phenomena and damage related conditions. It is considered advantageous that these systems perform characterization of age-related degradation in complex composite and metallic materials. Measurement techniques and analysis methods related to quantifying material thermal properties, elastic properties, density, microcrack formation, fiber buckling and breakage, etc. in complex composite material systems, adhesively bonded/built-up and/or polymer-matrix composite sandwich structures are of particular interest. Some consideration will be given to the IVHM /SHM ability to survive in on-orbit and deep space conditions, allow for additions or changes in instrumentation late in the design/development process and enable relocation or upgrade on orbit.

Technologies developed under this subtopic are of interest to NASA programs such as Space Launch System (SLS), Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV), Orion, and commercial launch providers. Metallic additive manufacturing (AM) technology builds near-net shape components one layer at a time using metal powder bed or wire fed processes and data from 3-D CAD models. Metallic AM technologies like Selective Laser Melting (SLM), Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), Electron Beam Freeform Fabrication (EBF3), and Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) are of interest to NASA for fabrication of advanced metallic aerospace components and in-space fabrication and repair. These technologies enable the direct fabrication of net or near-net shape components without the need for tooling and with minimal or no machining thereby reducing component lead time, manufacturing cost, and material waste. Metallic AM also has the potential to enable novel product designs that could not be fabricated using conventional subtractive machining processes and extends the life of in-service parts through innovative repair methodologies. Currently, some metallic AM systems use sensors for process control but not for in-situ quality assurance (QA) or flaw detection. The purpose of this subtopic is to invest in mid- and long-term research to establish rigorous, systematic, and scalable verification and validation methods for metallic AM. Beam tracking errors, part distortion, feedstock nozzle stand-off distance variability, excessive heat build-up in the deposit, stuck or unmelted feedstock, etc. can contribute to build deposit geometric anomalies and discontinuities. The objective would be to achieve a capability to have in-situ assessment during the deposition process to provide immediate feedback to the operator or a closed loop control system to enable real-time process correction or remedial actions to correct for defects. Although the technologies developed may be specific to one metallic AM system, it is desired that they have cross cutting capabilities to other metallic AM technologies. Proposals are invited that: Explore new and improved sensors and sensor systems for monitoring of the metallic AM build deposit. Offer technologies to use the signals generated by the energy beam (either electron beam or laser) or beam / substrate emissions for in-situ process monitoring and quality assurance.

Technologies should be compatible with standard high speed computer communication protocols and sensors should be able to update at frequencies on the order of 10 Hz. Highly desirable attributes are that technologies enable non-contact sensing and measurement, are vacuum compatible, and are relatively insensitive to contamination. Desirable attributes include that technologies are non-hazardous, do not require the use of additional consumables, and do not introduce contaminants into the process. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility in Phase I and show a path toward demonstration in Phase II of in-situ process monitoring and quality assurance.

Resupply is difficult during deep space missions; it requires a paradigm shift in the way the Agency currently relies on an Earth-based supply chain for spares, maintenance, repair, and hardware design models, including those currently on the International Space Station (ISS). With the ISS program extension, there is a high likelihood of necessary replacement parts. This is a unique opportunity to begin changing the current model for resupply and repair to prepare and mature technology for deep space exploration missions. 3-D printing, formally known as “Additive Manufacturing”, is the method of building parts layer-by-layer from data files such as Computer Aided Design models. Data files with tool and part schematics can be pre-loaded onto the device before a launch, or up-linked to the device while on-orbit. 3-D printers currently scheduled for on-board ISS use will employ extrusion-based additive manufacturing, which involves building an object out of plastic deposited by the melting of feedstock by an extruder head.

Production of recycled plastic filament while maintaining repeatable, consistent filament diameter of 1.75mm with ±0.1mm tolerance. Methods to avoid bulging of feedstock as the filament is created. Gravity-independent filament spooling capability: drawing the filament onto a feedstock spool as it is being created without relying on gravity to guide the filament. Goal for spool dimension should be 156mm OD, 48mm ID, 43mm wide. Environmental containment for Foreign Object Debris (FOD) and material off-gassing.

The subtopic will address two areas, manufacturing of structures and highly damage-tolerant materials for use in cryogenic environments. Proposals to each area will be considered separately. Areas of interest include: advances in PMC materials for large-scale structures and for in-space applications; innovative automated manufacturing processes (e.g., fiber placement); advanced non-autoclave curing; damage-tolerant/repairable structures; low-cost, durable tooling; high temperature PMC materials for high performance composite structures (high temperature applications); and materials with high resistance to micro cracking at cryogenic temperatures. Reliable, affordable, and practical joining techniques for large segmented composite structures are desired. Lightweight structures and PMC materials have been identified as a critical need for launch vehicles since the reduction of structural mass translates directly to vehicle additional performance, reduced cost, and increased payload mass capacity. Reliable large-scale (approximately 8 meters or greater in diameter) PMC structures will be critical to the ""heavy lift"" of America's next-generation space fleet. The capability to transfer and store for long-term propellant, particularly cryogenic propellants in orbit, can significantly increase the nation's ability to conduct complex and extended exploration missions beyond Earth's orbit. The use of PMC materials for cryotanks offers the potential of significant weight savings. Applications include storage of cryogenic propellants on an Earth Departure Stage, a lunar or asteroid descent vehicle, long-term cryogen storage on the Moon, and propellant tanks for a heavy lift launch vehicle. Consideration shall be made for manufacturability in the sense of either using out of autoclave cure or autoclave cure and, in made in sections, novel and reliable approaches to join sections of composite structures to take advantage of the high strength to weight properties so that the joining methods do not significantly increase the complexity or weight of the overall structure. Novel approaches from cradle to grave will be considered in the sense that these very large structures required robust and lightweight tooling and transportation methods for minimal modifications to existing facilities and use of existing transportation or minimal modifications to such infrastructures. Performance metrics for manufacturing structures include: achieving adequate structural and weight performance; manufacturing and life cycle affordability analysis; verifiable practices for scale-up; validation of confidence in design, materials performance, and manufacturing processes; low-cost, durable tooling; and quantitative risk reduction capability. Research should be conducted to demonstrate novel approaches, technical feasibility, and basic performance characterization for polymer matrix composite structures or low-cost, durable tooling during Phase I, and show a path toward a Phase II design allowables and prototype demonstration. Emphasis should be on demonstrable manufacturing technology that can be scaled up for very large structures. Performance metrics for materials developed for cryotanks are: temperature-dependent material properties including strength, modulus, CTE, and fracture toughness; and demonstrated improved resistance over present SOA of multi-directional laminates to microcracking under cryogenic temperature cycling. Initial property characterization would be done at the coupon level in Phase I. Generation of design allowables, characterization of long-term material durability, and fabrication of larger panels would be part of follow-on efforts. High temperature polymer matrices for high performance composite structures (high temperature applications) with ease of manufacturing using the current composite manufacturing techniques.

Also, novel metrological solutions that can measure figure errors over a large fraction of the PSD range are desired, especially techniques and instrumentation that can perform measurements while the optic is mounted to the figuring/polishing machine. Large lightweight monolithic metallic aspheres manufactured using innovative mirror substrate materials that can be assembled and welded together from smaller segments are sought. Also of interest is analytical software to process, fit, and model large optics surface metrology data with the goals to characterize surface morphology over spatial frequency bandwidths determined by the desired angular resolution performance; to provide stitched metrology capabilities obtained with different surface measuring instruments with different fields of view and resolution; to provide a data analysis tool for defining the optical surface fabrication tolerances based on the desired x-ray optics angular resolution performance; to allow forecasting of the surface morphological properties of optics. By the end of a Phase II program, technologies must be developed to the point where the technique or instrument can dovetail into an existing optics manufacturing facility producing optics at the R&D stage.

TA14 Thermal Management Systems,TA14.2 Thermal Control Systems,H3.01Thermal Control for Future Human Exploration Vehicles, JSC," GRC, GSFC, JPL, KSC, LaRC, MSFC","Future human spacecraft will require more sophisticated thermal control systems that can operate in severe environments ranging from full sun to deep space and can dissipate a wide range of heat loads. The systems must perform their function while using fewer spacecraft resources, including mass, volume and power. Advances are sought for microgravity thermal control in the following areas: Heat rejection systems and/or radiators that can operate at low fractions of their design heat load in the cold environments that are required for deep space missions. Systems that can maintain setpoint control and operate stably at 25% of their design heat load in a deep space (0 K) environment are sought. Innovative components, working fluids, and systems may be needed to achieve this goal. Lightweight non-venting phase change heat exchangers are sought to ameliorate the environmental transients that would be seen in planetary (or lunar) orbit. Heat exchangers that have minimal structural mass and good thermal performance are sought. The goal is a ratio exceeding 2/3 phase change material mass and 1/3 structural mass. Two-phase heat transfer components and system architectures that will allow the acquisition, transport, and rejection of waste heat loads in the range of 100 kW to 10 megawatts are sought. Nontoxic working fluids are needed that are compatible with aluminum components and combine low operating temperature limits (<250K) and favorable thermophysical properties - e.g., viscosity and specific heat. Technologies are expected to be raised from TRL2 to TRL 3/4 during Phase I. Minimum deliverables at the end of Phase I are analysis/test reports, but delivery of development hardware for further testing is desirable. In addition, the necessity and usefulness of a follow-on Phase II should be demonstrated. Technologies would be expected to be matured from TRL 3/4 to TRL 5 during a potential Phase II effort. Expected deliverables for a Phase II effort are analysis/test reports and prototypic hardware.

TA14 Thermal Management Systems,TA14.2 Thermal Control Systems,S3.07Thermal Control Systems, GSFC," ARC, GRC, JPL, JSC, MSFC","Future Spacecraft and instruments for NASA's Science Mission Directorate will require increasingly sophisticated thermal control technology. Innovative proposals for the cross-cutting thermal control discipline are sought in the following areas: Future highly integrated electronics for CubeSat/SmallSat will drastically increase the performance per unit volume, mass and power of electronics systems. High flux heat acquisition and transport devices are required. In addition, high conductivity, vacuum-compatible interface materials are needed in order to reduce interface temperature gradients and facilitate efficient heat removal. Components of advanced small spacecraft such as CubeSat/SmallSat will have very small masses (i.e., small thermal capacitance), and their temperatures are highly sensitive to variations in the component power output and spacecraft environmental temperature. Advanced thermal devices capable of maintaining components within their specified temperature ranges are needed. Some examples are: Phase change systems with high thermal capacity, low volume and low mass for endothermic/exothermal thermal management and conditioning. Durable thermal coatings with low absorptance, variable emmittance, and good electrical conductivity. High performance, low cost insulation systems for diverse environments. Passive radiator turn-down devices to enable variation of heat rejection rates. Advanced thermal control systems with easily adaptable/reconfigurable thermal management architectures are needed in order to accommodate multiple heat sources and multiple heat sinks, particularly a thermal system that can facilitate heat sharing among on and off components and heat dissipation among multiple radiators placed on various locations on the spacecraft surface. Also needed are improved design and analysis tools for rapid design, integration and testing, and flight operations. Thermal control systems for long duration operation are needed, including long life pumps, single-phase and two-phase mechanically pumped fluid systems, components adaptable to distributed heat acquisition and rejection in diverse environments such as high radiation doses (Europa, etc.), and novel heat lift capabilities that enable operation in warm environments. Advanced detectors and optical systems at infrared wavelengths require efficient cooling methods to low temperatures. Advanced cryogenic thermal devices for precision temperature measurement and control over much larger sensor areas than currently possible are needed. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II hardware demonstration. Phase II should deliver a demonstration unit for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.

Proposals more aligned with exploration mission requirements should be proposed in H3.01. Read less>>"
TA15 Aeronautics,TA15.1 Additional Subtopics,A1.02Inflight Icing Hazard Mitigation Technology, GRC,,"NASA is concerned with the prevention of encounters with hazardous in-flight conditions and the mitigation of their effects when they do occur. Under this subtopic, proposals are invited that explore new and dramatically improved research tools and technologies related to inflight airframe and engine icing hazards for manned and unmanned vehicles. Technologies of interest should address the detection, measurement, and/or the mitigation of the hazards of flight into super-cooled liquid water clouds and flight into regions of high mass concentrations of ice crystal. Areas of particular interest include: Technology to measure the phase (ice or liquid), size, and mass concentration of ice and liquid density of water particles as they are ingested into a turbofan engine core flow path and in upstream wind tunnel ducts. Technology to measure the mass of water that impinges on the leading edge of airframe components for droplet spectra having median volumetric diameters from 20 to 1000 microns. Past measurement methods using dye-tracers and blotter paper have demonstrated limitations, particularly for larger drop sizes. More advanced methods are sought that can improve accuracy and measurement time. Non-destructive 3-D ice density measurements of ice accretions on wind tunnel models. NASA has a need for non-optical methods to digitize ice shapes with rough external surfaces and internal voids as can occur with accretions on highly swept wings.

TA15 Aeronautics,TA15.1 Additional Subtopics,A2.01Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Integration in the National Airspace System (NAS) Research, AFRC," ARC, GRC, LaRC","The following subtopic is in support of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Integration in the National Airspace System (NAS) Project under the Integrated Systems Research Program (ISRP). There is an increasing need to fly UAS in the NAS to perform missions of vital importance to National Security and Defense, Emergency Management, Science, and to enable commercial applications. The UAS Integration in the NAS Project is structured under the following technical challenges: Airspace Integration - Validate technologies and procedures for UAS to remain an appropriate distance from other aircraft, and to safely and routinely interoperate with NAS and NextGen Air Traffic Services (ATS). Standards/Regulations - Validate minimum system and operational performance standards and certification requirements and procedures for UAS to safely operate in the NAS. Relevant Test Environment - Develop an adaptable, scalable, and schedulable relevant test environment for validating concepts and technologies for UAS to safely operate in the NAS. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations are built upon the condition of a pilot being in an aircraft. There exist few, if any, regulations specifically addressing UAS today. The primary user of UAS to date has been the military. The technologies and procedures to enable seamless operation and integration of UAS in the NAS need to be developed, validated, and employed by the FAA through rule making and policy development. The Project goal is to provide research findings to reduce technical barriers associated with integrating UAS into the NAS utilizing integrated system level tests in a relevant environment. The project is currently broken down into five subprojects: Separation Assurance/Sense and Avoid Interoperability (SSI) Communications Human Systems Integration Certification Integrated Test and Evaluation The fifth subproject, Integrated Test and Evaluation, is responsible for developing a live, virtual, and constructive test environment for the other four subprojects. During the first phase, (May-2011 to September-2013) the project has: Conducted initial modeling, simulation, and flight testing. Completed early subproject-focused deliverables (spectrum requirements, comparative analysis of certification methodologies, etc.). Validated the key technical elements identified by the project. The plan for the second phase includes the following: Conduct systems-level, integrated testing of concepts and/or capabilities that address barriers to routine access to the NAS. Develop a body of evidence (including validated data, algorithms, analysis, and recommendations) to support key decision makers in establishing policy, procedures, standards and regulations, enabling routine UAS access in the NAS. This solicitation seeks proposals, but is not limited, to develop concepts that can reduce the technical barriers related to the safety and operational challenges of routine UAS operations in the NAS. Certified Control and Non-Payload Communications (CNPC) system - Current civil UAS operations are significantly constrained by the lack of a standardized, certified control and non-payload communications (CNPC) system. The UAS CNPC system is to provide communications functions between the Unmanned Aircraft (UA) and the UA ground control station for such applications as: telecommands; non-payload telemetry; navigation aid data; air traffic control (ATC) voice relay; air traffic services (ATS) data relay; sense and avoid data relay; airborne weather radar data; and non-payload situational awareness video. New and innovative approaches to providing terrestrial and space-based high-bandwidth CNPC systems that are inexpensive, small, low latency, reliable, and secure offer opportunities for quantum jumps in UAS utility and capabilities. Of particular interest are: Technologies for High power C-band amplifiers and highly linear C-band power amplifiers/linearization of high power C-band amplifiers. Miniaturization of C-band terrestrial radio components/systems and C- Ku- and Ka-Band satellite communications components/systems. Conformal steerable antennas for satellite communications links in C-, Ku- and Ka Band. Weather Information Systems for GCS - On-board, real-time graphic aviation weather information products have been developed and successfully implemented for manned cockpits. Their use is now widespread and their safety impact widely recognized. The applicability of such products for operators and ground control pilots to enhance situation awareness and improve mission planning and execution is of interest to NASA. Systems such as the NASA developed Aviation Weather Information (AWIN) system that included software, data and data-link applications, color weather graphics such as composite-radar mosaic, lightning-strike data, wind data, satellite images and forecasts could be integrated into a ground control station to provide pilots with weather awareness before and during mission execution. Improved weather awareness should allow aircrews to avoid most weather-related problems through both pre-flight and en-route planning. While the use of these systems has been explored for military UAS operations, their applicability to civil and public operations has not yet been explored. Safety Analysis and Methodologies - UAS operations are untried in the civil NAS. Unlike other aircraft, there is not an extensive record of civil operations upon which to forecast the safety of UAS operations in the NAS. The introduction of UAS into the NAS raises many safety issues and concerns. Typically, anytime a new capability is added into the NAS, an Operational Safety Assessment (OSA) is performed by the FAA, to determine whether that introduction of new capability will enhance or detract from the safety of the NAS. As these UAS represent a wholly new operational system, traditional approaches cannot suffice. Research is needed to identify and develop new safety analysis approaches, as well as prognostic indicators and potential new safety metrics. Autonomous Operations - As vehicle capabilities and machine intelligence continue to evolve, it is expected that future air vehicles, especially unmanned vehicles, will assume an increasing level of independent decision-making, flight monitoring and management, and trajectory management. As the Next-Generation Air Traffic Management System (NextGen) continues to evolve and expand, the future system will need to concurrently develop operational accommodations for these aircraft that manifest increasing levels of autonomy. Thus, autonomous vehicles and NextGen must evolve in complementary ways to accommodate these future operational considerations. At a minimum, future autonomous systems must demonstrate successfully the following characteristics: Collision/hazard avoidance. Autonomous navigation under uncertain conditions. Cooperative task completion (if more than one aircraft is needed for a particular operation). Recognition of anomalies. Long term system diagnostics, failure prediction and correction. Development of a UAS Flight Inspection and Cargo Aircraft Capability Concept - Currently the FAA conducts flight inspections of the ground based air navigational aids and guidance systems (MLS, TACAN, VASI) in Antarctica using a CL-601 Challenger corporate executive jet type of aircraft, not certified for operations from ice and gravel runways. The risk for damage to these costly aircraft is high and no flights are made to remote areas, like Antarctica, without the inclusion of maintenance personnel among the crew. A UAS, RPV equipped for flight inspection work in Antarctica and other remote areas utilizing a simple rugged STOL type of vehicle, ski or wheel equipped, (thus capable of operating from rough snow, ice and short gravel runways) would greatly reduce the risks and costs of flight inspecting and light air logistics in Antarctica. The environment in Antarctica is a perfect venue to demonstrate an efficient, practical and environmental friendly use of unmanned aircraft technologies to a worldwide audience. Basic requirements for a drone utilized in this type of operation include: Ability to carry a 1000-pound payload 800 nautical miles and return with no need for additional fuel. Be TCAS responsive and “visible” to other traffic. Be equipped with bubble observation windows and mounts for various surveillance and photography systems. Have the capability to operate from the short gravel runways. Read less>>"
TA15 Aeronautics,TA15.1 Additional Subtopics,A4.01Ground Test Techniques and Measurement Technologies, LaRC," AFRC, ARC, GRC","The Ground and Flight Test Techniques and Measurements topic supports the experimental modeling and simulation requirements of NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate from takeoff speeds to Mach 10, as well as the testing requirements of other government and commercial entities. The primary objective is to develop innovative tools and technologies that enhance measurement capabilities, improve ground and flight resource utilization, and provide capability sustainment. This year the primary emphasis is on ground testing requirements. Wind tunnel vehicle design databases have traditionally included the foundational measurements of forces, discrete surface pressures, and discrete surface temperatures. However, designing and testing future vehicles with highly integrated and possibly distributed propulsion and flow control systems will require enhanced, remotely sensed global surface measurements to accurately define the vehicle performance and acoustic levels covering a wide range of operational conditions. Enhanced optical systems are required to visualize the flow interactions both on and off the surface. Non-intrusive measurement systems offering multi-component velocities, density, and pressure in the tunnel stream are required to routinely quantify and baseline the test environment and to establish boundary conditions for advanced computational simulations. Non-intrusive measurements of off-body and near-body flow parameters both at a point and globally (i.e., planar or volumetric) are necessary to examine fluid-fluid and fluid-structure interactions for computational solution validation. In all cases, significant measurement accuracy enhancements are required to achieve the revolutionary aircraft systems of the future. Measurement systems must be robust and user-friendly to achieve the level of utility required for practical and routine application. Clean seeding methods that do not contaminate anti-turbulence screens are required in the wind tunnel testing environment; seedless methods for velocity measurements are particularly desired. Compact measurement systems and analysis techniques with dual use capability in both ground and flight test environments are valuable, enabling smooth transition between each. Since wind tunnel test data must ultimately represent free-air conditions, techniques and/or analysis methods that can demonstrate and articulate novel ground to flight extrapolation methodologies are sought. In all cases, measurement methods that can significantly increase data capture per test point are desired, including the simultaneous measurement of multiple flow parameters. Accordingly, the topic solicits cutting-edge enhancements that significantly improve existing test and measurement capabilities, and enabling tools that provide new opportunities for aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic discovery for NextGen and high-speed transportation systems. The contraction of the Nation's ground-based testing resources emphasizes the technological need to improve wind tunnel utilization. Advanced methods that aid pre-test planning, improve data collection, enhance visual display in a data rich environment, and provide rapid analysis are solicited. With an aging and reduced workforce comes the challenge of capability sustainment. Tools and technologies are solicited that enable knowledge capture, offer ubiquitous training, and provide workforce agility. Read less>>"

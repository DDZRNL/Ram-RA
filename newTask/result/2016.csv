TA1 Launch Propulsion Systems,TA1.3 Air Breathing Propulsion Systems,A1.07Propulsion Efficiency - Turbomachinery Technology for Reduced Fuel Burn, GRC,"System and technology studies have indicated that advanced gas turbine propulsion will remain critical for future subsonic transports. Turbomachinery includes the rotating machinery in the high and low pressure spools, transition ducts, purge and bleed flows, casing and hub. We are interested in traditional gas turbine turbomachinery, as well as in innovative concepts as exo-skeletal engines, intercooled gas turbines, cooled cooling air, waste heat recovery, and other concepts. NASA is looking for improvement in aeropropulsive efficiency. Areas of interest include: Improved components of current architectures and cycles, novel components and cycles to improve cycle limits, and novel architectures to improve mission efficiency limits. In the compression system, advanced concepts and technologies are required to enable higher overall pressure ratio, high stage loading and wider operating range. In the turbine, the very high cycle temperatures demanded by advanced engine cycles place a premium on the cooling technologies required to ensure adequate life of the turbine component. New capabilities as well as challenges are provided with expected increased use of ceramic matrix composites (CMC’s). Reduced cooling flow rates and/or increased cycle temperatures enabled by these technologies have a dramatic impact on the engine performance. Such improvements will enable reduced fuel burn, reduced weight and part count, and will enable advanced variable cycle engines for various missions. Innovative proposals in the following turbomachinery and heat transfer areas are solicited: Small core turbomachinery - Higher fan Bypass Ratio (BPR) will require more compact engine core sizes rather than by growing the fan diameter, resulting in large tip/endwall and purge flow losses. Tip-leakage mitigation technologies for small-core turbomachinery and concept for circumvent the issue via innovative gas turbine designs. Desensitizing to losses due to tip leakage, secondary flows, seals, purge flows, and cooling air. Shorter transition ducts. Optimized integrated combustor – turbine systems - Integration concepts of combustor and turbine for improved overall and component performance are being sought. Flow control in turbomachinery - Advanced turbomachinery active and passive flow control concepts to enable increased high stage loading in single and multi-stage axial compressors while maintaining or improving aerodynamic efficiency and operability. Technologies are sought that would reduce dependence on traditional range extending techniques (such as variable inlet guide vane and variable stator geometry) in compression systems. These may include flow control techniques near the compressor end walls and on the rotor and stator blade surfaces. Technologies are sought to reduce tip clearance leakage as well as rapid acting tip clearance control in compressors and turbines. Technologies are sought to eliminate flow separation in low pressure turbines and transition ducts, improve off-design operation and enable variable cycle operation. Cooling and thermal management - Novel turbine cooling concepts are sought to enable very high turbine cooling effectiveness. The concepts are mainly for ceramic-based turbine materials such as ceramic matrix composite (CMC) vanes and blades. The availability of advanced manufacturing techniques may enable improved cooling designs beyond the current state-of-the-art. These concepts may include film cooling concepts, internal cooling concepts, and innovative methods to couple the film and internal cooling designs.

TA1 Launch Propulsion Systems,TA1.5 Unconventional/Other Propulsion Systems,S3.06Terrestrial and Planetary Balloons, GSFC,"Terrestrial Balloons NASA’s Scientific Balloons provide practical and cost effective platforms for conducting discovery science, development and testing for future space instruments, as well as training opportunities for future scientists and engineers. Balloons can reach altitudes above 36 kilometers, with suspended masses up to 3600 kilograms, and can stay afloat for several weeks. Currently, the Balloon Program is on the verge of introducing an advanced balloon system that will enable 100 day missions at mid-latitudes and thus resemble the performance of a small spacecraft at a fraction of the cost. In support of this development, NASA is seeking innovative technologies in three key areas: Power Storage Improved and innovative devices to store electrical energy onboard balloon payloads are needed. Long duration balloon flights can experience 12 hours or more of darkness, and excess electrical power generated during the day from solar panels needs to be stored and used. Improvements are needed over the current state of the art in power density, energy density, overall size, overall mass and/or cost. Typical parameters for balloon are 28 VDC and 100 to 1000 watts power consumption. Rechargeable batteries are presently used for balloon payload applications. Lithium Ion rechargeable batteries with energy densities of 60 watt-hours per kilogram are the current state of the art. Higher power storage energy densities, and power generation capabilities of up to 2000 watts are needed for future support. Satellite Communications Improved and innovative downlink bitrates using satellite relay communications from balloon payloads are needed. Long duration balloon flights currently utilize satellite communication systems to relay science and operations data from the balloon to ground based control centers. The current maximum downlink bit rate is 150 kilobits per second operating continuously during the balloon flight. Future requirements are for bit rates of 1 megabit per second or more. Improvements in bit rate performance, reduction in size and mass of existing systems, or reductions in cost of high bit rate systems are needed. TDRSS and Iridium satellite communications are currently used for balloon payload applications. A commercial S-band TDRSS transceiver and mechanically steered 18 dBi gain antenna provide 150 kbps continuous downlink. TDRSS K-band transceivers are available but are currently cost prohibitive. Open port Iridium service is under development, but the operational cost is prohibitive. UV Protection Technologies Innovative, economic, and applicable processes or materials to protect the balloon flight train subsystems and the balloon components are needed. Long duration balloon missions on the order of 100 days will expose the balloon flight train subsystems such as the parachute, and the balloon components such as the high strength tendons, to the harmful effects of UV exposure. The impact may lead to shorter duration missions and/or severe damage to the science payloads. Innovative concepts are need for the protection of these subsystems or components to eliminate or minimize these adverse UV effects. The proposed innovative concepts shall be economic and practical. It shall be easy to implement with no major impact on balloon design, fabrication, packaging, or launch operations. Planetary Balloons Innovations in materials, structures, and systems concepts have enabled the lifetime of Titan and Venus buoyant vehicles to play an expanding role in NASA's future Solar System Exploration Program. Balloons are expected to carry scientific payloads at Titan and Venus that will perform in-situ investigations of their atmospheres and near surface environments. Both Titan and Venus feature extreme environments that significantly impact the design of balloons for those two worlds and efficient use of energy is critical. Proposals are sought in the following areas: Floating Platforms for Venus (New) NASA is interested in conducting long term monitoring of the Venus atmosphere and the signatures of seismic and volcanic events from the planetary surface using floating vehicles at altitudes of between 30 and 45 km for periods in excess of five years. Concepts that use ammonia or water as a source of buoyancy as well as conventional light gases hydrogen and helium should be considered. A primary focus should be on the design of the flotation device and the materials for achieving long duration operation. The temperature at 45 km is roughly 110° C; at 30 km it is about 225° C. It is expected that a Phase I effort will consist of a system-level design and a proof-of-concept experiment on one or more key components. Altitude and Positional Control for Titan Aerial Vehicles (NEW) NASA is interested in Titan aerial vehicles that can both change altitude and also execute controlled movements in latitude and longitude in order to target surface locations of interest. Innovative concepts are sought that can minimize the use of scarce power resources and can achieve controlled motions in latitude under all anticipated atmosphere conditions and in longitude for parts of the Titan year. The targeted capabilities for the system are as follows: altitude range between the surface and 15 km, system mass of payload, power and communications systems of 100 kg; average power usage for horizontal and vertical mobility of less than 50 watts. It is expected that a Phase I effort will consist of a complete system-level design and a proof-of-concept experiment on one or more key components. Read less>>", JPL
TA2 In-Space Propulsion Technologies,TA2.1 Chemical Propulsion,A1.03Low Emissions/Clean Power - Combustion Technology/Emissions Measurement Techniques, GRC,"Achieving low emissions and finding new pathways to cleaner power are critical for the development of future air vehicles. Vehicles for subsonic and supersonic flight regimes will be required to operate on a variety of certified aircraft fuels and emit extremely low amounts of gaseous and particulate emissions to satisfy increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Future vehicles will be more fuel-efficient which will result in smaller engine cores operating at higher pressures. Future combustors will also likely employ lean burn concepts which are more susceptible to combustion instabilities. Fundamental combustion research coupled with associated physics based model development of combustion processes will provide the foundation for technology development critical for these vehicles. Combustion involves multi-phase, multi-component fuel, turbulent, unsteady, 3-D, reacting flows where much of the physics of the processes are not completely understood. CFD codes used for combustion do not currently have the predictive capability that is typically found for non-reacting flows. Low emissions combustion concepts require very rapid mixing of the fuel and air with a minimum pressure loss to achieve complete combustion in the smallest volume. Areas of specific interest where research is solicited include: Development of laser-based diagnostics for quantitative spatially and temporally resolved measurements of fuel/air ratio in reacting flows at elevated pressure. Development of ultra-sensitive instruments for determining the size-dependent mass of combustion generated particle emissions. Low emissions combustor concepts for small high pressure engine cores. Development of miniature high-frequency fuel modulation valve for combustion instability control able to withstand the surrounding high-temperature air environment. Infusion/Commercial Potential – These developments will impact future aircraft engine combustor designs (lower emission, control instabilities) and may have commercial applications in other gas-turbine based industries (such as power generation and industrial burners).

TA3 Space Power and Energy Storage,TA3.1 Power Generation,H8.01Thermal Energy Conversion, GRC,"NASA needs innovative technologies that convert thermal energy into electricity for space power generation on orbiting platforms, extraterrestrial surfaces, and space transportation vehicles. The thermal energy could be supplied by nuclear reactors, radioisotope heat sources, solar concentrators, chemical reactions, or as waste heat from other space systems. The focus of this subtopic is the energy conversion subsystem. Proposals are requested on thermal energy conversion approaches that offer high efficiency, low mass, high reliability, long life, and low cost. Candidate technologies include thermodynamic heat engines such as Stirling, Brayton, and Rankine as well as thermoelectric and thermionic devices. Ancillary components used to deliver heat (e.g., heat transport loops, heat pipes) to the energy conversion and reject waste heat (e.g., heat pipes, radiators) are also of interest. The primary mission pull is providing electric power for human Mars surface missions that require kilowatts for remote science stations and rovers, or 10s of kilowatts for crew habitats and in-situ resource utilization plants. A secondary mission pull is providing electric power for Mars transportation vehicles that require 10s of kilowatts for crew life support and vehicle subsystems. The Mars missions may be preceded by human precursor missions to near earth objects, cis-lunar space, and the lunar surface during which the Mars technologies could be demonstrated. The anticipated heat source temperature ranges are 800 to 1300 K for nuclear, solar, and chemical sources and less than 400 to 500 K for waste heat. The expected operating lifetime ranges from several years to greater than 10 years. The proposals should focus on energy conversion subsystems and components with a current technology readiness level of 2 or 3. The Phase I effort should include conceptual design with analytical or experimental proof-of-concept based on the expected operating environment and system interfaces (e.g., heat source, heat rejection). The Phase II effort should include development of breadboards or prototypes that can be operated at the contractor's facility to demonstrate functionality in a laboratory environment. If the contractor testing is successful, the hardware will be considered for integration into NASA ground tests and flight experiments with representative system interfaces and relevant operating environments. Upon completion of successful integrated system tests at NASA, Phase III projects would be pursued to infuse the technologies into flight projects. Read less>>"," JPL, JSC, MSFC"
TA3 Space Power and Energy Storage,TA3.3 Power Management and Distribution,Z1.01High Power/Voltage Electronics, GSFC,"NASA is seeking performance improvements to Power Management and Distribution (PMAD) systems through increases to the operating voltages and temperatures of these electrical components. Although many parts exist in the commercial market place that would represent significant improvements over the state of the art space qualified components, these parts have failed to pass critical tests related to space qualification, most importantly in terms of their radiation tolerance. It is believed that the development and integration of high voltage/high temperature components that can be space qualified will lead to increases in system level performance as they will tend to increase efficiency and decrease mass at the system architecture level. Such performance improvements are necessary if NASA is to realize several operational concepts such as very high power Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) that undergird their future mission architectures. For example, SEP is a key technology supporting NASA’s deep space asteroid retrieval mission. This SEP mission requires total power on the order of 50 kW with a thruster power processing unit that steps up voltages to 700 V or more. These parameters are not truly negotiable and in turn dictate certain design choices for current and voltage regulation across the system. Given the space qualified electronic parts available today, system engineers are frequently required to make sub-optimal design choices. In a simplistic but specific realization, higher voltage parts allow power generation at higher voltages on the arrays themselves, this higher voltage allows for the same power to be transferred at lower current thereby reducing cable mass at the system level. At a more general level within the PMAD architecture, the use of presently available parts forces design choices that end in lower operating efficiency and increased heat generation within the electronic system, which in turn drive overall system mass. The premise of this solicitation is that there have been recent improvements to semi-conductor devices at the material level, e.g., SiC and GaN, which have enabled higher efficiency, voltage and temperature regimes for parts and systems working terrestrially. However the first generation devices have proven unsatisfactory for use in space applications due to radiation-induced early failures after exposure to heavy-ion fluences of concern to most space missions. Further research and development effort must be accomplished to fully understand the failure mechanisms within devices made of these advanced materials and iterative design cycles must then be conducted to develop components that have the performance characteristics required for future NASA missions. The types of components coming under this topic include: Semiconductor switches, e.g., the design of Wide Band Gap semiconductors such as switches and diodes using GaN or SiC, with minimum voltage and current ratings of 1200 V and 12 A. Switch driver diodes. High temperature capacitors. Interconnection wires for switchgears. Associated control electronics. This solicitation topic seeks proposals that address each of the following points: Analysis and research into the failure modes related to heavy-ion radiation exposure, as well as high temperature operation of GaN and SiC devices. Design and development of “next-generation” components. It is important to note that technologies of interest to NASA under this topic must not simply provide an incremental improvement as the solution but must have the potential to significantly improve upon device operating points, thermal range, heavy-ion single-event effect tolerance, and the mass and volume characteristics. Proposals submitted in response to this topic must state the initial component state of the art and justify the expected final performance metrics. Target performance levels include: Radiation hardness: 300 krad(Si) total ionizing dose tolerance, and For vertical-field power devices: No heavy-ion induced permanent destructive effects upon irradiation with ions having a silicon-equivalent surface-incident linear energy transfer (LET) of 40 MeV-cm2/mg and sufficient energy to fully penetrate the epitaxial layer(s) prior to the ions reaching their maximum LET (Bragg peak) For all other devices: No heavy-ion induced permanent destructive effects upon irradiation with ions having a silicon-equivalent surface-incident linear energy transfer (LET) of 75 MeV-cm2/mg and sufficient energy to fully penetrate the active volume prior to the ions reaching their maximum LET (Bragg peak).

TA3 Space Power and Energy Storage,TA3.4 Cross Cutting Technology,"S3.03Power Electronics and Management, and Energy Storage", GRC,"NASA’s science vision (http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2014/05/02/2014_Science_Plan-0501_tagged.pdf) is to use the vantage point of space to achieve with the science community and our partners a deep scientific understanding of the Sun and its effects on the solar system, our home planet, other planets and solar system bodies, the interplanetary environment, and the universe beyond. Scientific priorities for future planetary science missions are guided by the recommendations of the decadal surveys published by the National Academies. The goal of the decadal surveys is to articulate the priorities of the scientific community, and the surveys are therefore the starting point for NASA’s strategic planning process in science (http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2014/04/18/FY2014_NASA_StrategicPlan_508c.pdf). The most recent planetary science decadal survey, Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013 - 2022, was released in 2011. This report recommended a balanced suite of missions to enable a steady stream of new discoveries and capabilities to address challenges such as sample return missions and outer planet exploration. Under this subtopic, proposals are solicited to develop energy storage and power electronics to enable or enhance the capabilities of future NASA science missions. The unique requirements for the power systems for these missions can vary greatly, with advancements in components needed above the current State of the Art (SOA) for high energy density, high power density, long life, high reliability, low mass/volume, radiation tolerance, and wide temperature operation. Other subtopics which could potentially benefit from these technology developments include S4.04 Extreme Environments Technology, and S4.01 Planetary Entry, Descent and Landing Technology. This subtopic is also directly tied to S3.02 Propulsion Systems for Robotic Science Missions for the development of advanced Power Processing Units and associated components. Power Electronics and Management NASA’s Planetary Science Division is working to implement a balanced portfolio within the available budget and based on the decadal survey that will continue to make exciting scientific discoveries about our solar system. This balanced suite of missions show the need for low mass/volume power electronics and management systems and components that can operate in extreme environment for future NASA Science Missions. In addition, studying the Sun, the heliosphere, and other planetary environments as an interconnected system is critical for understanding the implications for Earth and humanity as we venture forth through the solar system. To that end, the NASA heliophysics program seeks to perform innovative space research missions to understand: The Sun and its variable activity. How solar activity impacts Earth and the solar system. Fundamental physical processes that are important at Earth and throughout the universe by using space as a laboratory. Heliophysics also seeks to enable research based on these missions and other sources to understand the connections among the Sun, Earth, and the solar system for science and to assure human safety and security both on Earth and as we explore beyond it. Advances in electrical power technologies are required for the electrical components and systems of these future spacecrafts/platforms to address program size, mass, efficiency, capacity, durability, and reliability requirements. Radioisotope power systems (RPS), Advanced Modular Power Systems (AMPS) and In-Space Electric Propulsion (ISP) are several programs of interest which would directly benefit from advancements in this technology area. These types of programs, including Mars Sample Return using Hall thrusters and power processing units (PPUs), require advancements in radiation hardened power electronics, especially tolerant of single event upsets, and systems beyond the state-of-the-art. Of importance are expected improvements in energy density, speed, efficiency, or wide-temperature operation (-125° C to over 450° C) with a number of thermal cycles. Novel approaches to minimizing the weight of advanced PPUs are also of interest. Advancements are sought for power electronic devices, components, packaging and cabling for programs with power ranges of a few watts for minimum missions to up to 20 kilowatts for large missions. In addition to electrical component development, RPS has a need for intelligent, fault-tolerant Power Management and Distribution (PMAD) technologies to efficiently manage the system power for these deep space missions. Also, in order to maximize functional capability for Earth Observations, operate higher performance instruments and deliver significantly better data and imagery from a small spacecraft, more capable power systems are needed. NASA is interested in a power system (stretch goal of 100w) that can be integrated into a cubesat or nanosat for this purpose. The power system package must be restricted to 6U or 3U volume, and the design should minimize orientation restrictions. The system should be capable of operating for a minimum of 6 months in LEO. SMD's In-space Propulsion Technology, Radioisotope Power Systems and Cubesat/Nanosat programs are direct customers of this subtopic. Overall technologies of interest include: High power density/high efficiency power electronics and associated drivers for switching elements.

Cubesat/nanosat power systems up to 100 watts Patent 6,461,944, Methods for growth of relatively large step-free SiC crystal surfaces Neudeck, et al., October 8, 2002. A method for growing arrays of large-area device-size films of step-free (i.e., atomically flat) SiC surfaces for semiconductor electronic device applications is disclosed. This method utilizes a lateral growth process that better overcomes the effect of extended defects in the seed crystal substrate that limited the obtainable step-free area achievable by prior art processes. The step-free SiC surface is particularly suited for the heteroepitaxial growth of 3C (cubic) SiC, AlN, and GaN films used for the fabrication of both surface-sensitive devices (i.e., surface channel field effect transistors such as HEMT's and MOSFET's) as well as high-electric field devices (pn diodes and other solid-state power switching devices) that are sensitive to extended crystal defects. Energy Storage Future science missions will require advanced primary and secondary battery systems capable of operating at temperature extremes from -100° C for Titan missions to 400 to 500° C for Venus missions, and a span of -230° C to +120° C for Lunar Quest. The Outer Planet Assessment Group and the 2011 PSD Relevant Technologies Document have specifically called out high energy density storage systems as a need for the Titan/Enceladus Flagship and planetary exploration missions. In addition, high energy-density rechargeable electrochemical battery systems that offer greater than 50,000 charge/discharge cycles (10 year operating life) for low-earth-orbiting spacecraft, 20 year life for geosynchronous (GEO) spacecraft, are desired. Advancements to battery energy storage capabilities that address one or more of the above requirements for the stated missions combined with very high specific energy and energy density (>200 Wh/kg for secondary battery systems), along with radiation tolerance are of interest. In addition to batteries, other advanced energy storage/load leveling technologies designed to the above mission requirements, such as mechanical or magnetic energy storage devices, are of interest. These technologies have the potential to minimize the size and mass of future power systems. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II, and when possible, deliver a demonstration unit for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.

Moreover, embeddable passive wireless sensors can greatly increase the capabilities of the sensing and telemetry portion of a spacecraft. This would be relevant to any of the ascent and landing systems needed for planetary exploration as part of the spacecraft or mission support systems. Of particular interest is the capability of adding sensors at a low cost - enabling better Integrated Health Management and Spacecraft Autonomy functions, which depend upon better sensing of spacecraft state and environment. If developed under STMD, the resulting technology has high potential for infusion into SMD and HEOMD Programs leading to more effective ascent vehicles, better spacecraft management, new entry, descent and landing systems and future planetary exploration systems. While wireless sensors have been slowly improved, tested and deployed on earth, their extension to aerospace has not occurred. The technology itself does not limit such extension, but rather traditional methods using wired interconnects have proven adequate for most vehicles and missions. However, there are major advantages conferred by wireless technology for aerospace avionics that make adoption favorable. Wireless technology Reduces the mass and volume of spacecraft by eliminating large heavy cable runs. This is particularly useful for small satellites, where internal volume is often highly constrained particularly for subsystem cables and connectors. This would enable smaller and lighter spacecraft. Can transfer data across pressure interfaces, into remote locations where it is difficult to run cables and onto movable structures where cables are at risk of failure. Provides less intrusive measurement and health monitoring capability by enabling sensors within fuel tanks and pipes and across pressure interfaces without breaching the structure. Supports late additions or mission enhancements by significantly limiting changes to vehicle structure and data paths. Functions despite structural failures that can break physical wires such as those caused by micrometeorite impacts or connector contamination, thereby creating heterogeneous redundancy for critical systems that improve reliability and safety. Supports dynamic reconfiguration of networks and components, enabling robust response to faults or changes in operating mode. In time, wireless interconnects and interaction methods could largely supplant (or perhaps more importantly, complement) wired methods. Consider the adoption of mobile computing devices, which rely on purely wireless interfaces for communication, printing and even peripheral connection. Such advantages can apply to spacecraft, distributed sensor networks and even distributed instruments and planetary surface exploration systems. Specifically, this subtopic solicits the following technologies: Low power, low mass, and small volume components, where sensor/actuator modules are less than 20 grams in mass and less than 1 cc in volume. Of particular interest are highly scalable systems for measurement and data acquisition where total subsystem mass would be under 1 Kg and would operate under 3 W of power. Components capable of surviving and operating in aerospace environments requiring tolerance to extreme temperatures, shock and vibration, and radiation effects that exist for satellites, launch vehicles, planetary and space habitats, deep space exploration systems and landing/re-entry systems.

"TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems",TA4.5 Autonomy,S5.05Fault Management Technologies, ARC,"As science missions are given increasingly complex goals and have more pressure to reduce operations costs, system autonomy increases. Fault Management (FM) is one of the key components of system autonomy. FM consists of the operational mitigations of spacecraft failures. It is implemented with spacecraft hardware, on-board autonomous software that controls hardware, software, information redundancy, and ground-based software and operations procedures. Many recent Science Mission Directorate (SMD) missions have encountered major cost overruns and schedule slips during test and verification of FM functions. These overruns are due to a lack of understanding of FM functions early in the mission definition cycles and to FM architectures that do not provide attributes of transparency, verifiability, fault isolation capability, or fault coverage. The NASA FM Handbook is under development to improve the FM design, development, verification and validation and operations processes. FM approaches, architectures, and tools are needed to improve early understanding of needed FM capabilities by project managers and FM engineers and to improve the efficiency of implementing and testing FM. Specific objectives are to: Improve the ability to predict FM system complexity and estimate development and operations costs. Enable cost-effective FM design architectures and operations. Determine completeness and appropriateness of FM designs and implementations. Decrease the labor and time required to develop and test FM models and algorithms. Improve visualization of the full FM design across hardware, software, and operations procedures. Determine extent of testing required, completeness of verification planned, and residual risk resulting from incomplete coverage. Increase data integrity between multi-discipline tools. Standardize metrics and calculations across FM, SE, S&MA and operations disciplines. Increase reliability of FM systems. Expected outcomes are better estimation and control of FM complexity and development costs, improved FM designs, and accelerated advancement of FM tools and techniques. The approach of this subtopic is to seek the right balance between sufficient reliability and cost appropriate to the mission type and risk posture. Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, SMD missions. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and NASA relevance during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration. Offerors should demonstrate awareness of the state-of-the-art of their proposed technology, and should leverage existing commercial capabilities and research efforts where appropriate. Specific technology in the forms listed below is needed to increase delivery of high quality FM systems. These approaches, architectures and tools must be consistent with and enable the NASA FM Handbook concepts and processes: FM Design Tools - System modeling and analyses significantly contributes to the quality of FM design; however, the time it takes to translate system design information into system models often decreases the value of the modeling and analysis results. Examples of enabling techniques and tools are modeling automation, spacecraft modeling libraries, expedited algorithm development, sensor placement analyses, and system model tool integration. FM Visualization Tools - FM systems incorporate hardware, software, and operations mechanisms. The ability to visualize the full FM system and the contribution of each mechanism to protecting mission functions and assets is critical to assessing the completeness and appropriateness of the FM design to the mission attributes (mission type, risk posture, operations concept, etc.). Fault trees and state transition diagrams are examples of visualization tools that could contribute to visualization of the full FM design. FM Verification and Validation Tools - As complexity of spacecraft and systems increases, the extensiveness of testing required to verify and validate FM implementations can be resource intensive. Automated test case development, false positive/false negative test tools, model verification and validation tools, and test coverage risk assessments are examples of contributing technologies. FM Design Architectures - FM capabilities may be implemented through numerous system, hardware, and software architecture solutions. The FM architecture trade space includes options such as embedded in the flight control software or independent onboard software; on board versus ground-based capabilities; centralized or distributed FM functions; sensor suite implications; integration of multiple FM techniques; innovative software FM architectures implemented on flight processors or on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs); and execution in real-time or off-line analysis post-operations. Alternative architecture choices such as model-based approaches could help control FM system complexity and cost and could offer solutions to transparency, verifiability, and completeness challenges. Multi-discipline FM Interoperation - FM designers, Systems Engineering, Safety and Mission Assurance, and Operations perform analyses and assessments of reliabilities, failure modes and effects, sensor coverage, failure probabilities, anomaly detection and response, contingency operations, etc. The relationships between multi-discipline data and analyses are inconsistent and misinterpreted. Resources are expended either in effort to resolve disconnects in data and analyses or worse, reduced mission success due to failure modes that were overlooked. Solutions that address data integrity, identification of metrics, and standardization of data products, techniques and analyses will reduce cost and failures. Read less>>"," JPL, MSFC"
"TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems",TA4.5 Autonomy,S4.05Contamination Control and Planetary Protection, JPL,"A need to develop technologies to implement Contamination Control and Planetary Protection requirements has emerged in recent years with increased interest in investigating bodies with the potential for life detection such as Europa, Enceladus, Mars, etc. and the potential for sample return from such bodies. Planetary Protection is concerned with both forward and backward contamination. Forward contamination is the transfer of viable organisms from Earth to another body. Backward contamination is the transfer of material posing a biological threat back to Earth's biosphere. NASA is seeking innovative technologies or applications of technologies to facilitate meeting portions of forward and backward contamination Planetary Protection requirements as well as analytical technologies that can ensure hardware and instrumentation can meet organic contamination requirements in an effort to preserve sample science integrity. For contamination control efforts, analytical technologies and techniques for quantifying submicron particle and organic contamination for validating surface cleaning methods are needed. In particular, capabilities for measuring Total Organic Carbon (TOC) at <<40 ppb or <<20 ng/cm2 on a surface and detection of particles <0.2 microns in size are being sought. In addition, techniques for detection of one or more of the following molecules and detection level are being needed: DNA (1 fmole). Dipicolinic acid (1 pg). N-acetylglucosamine (1 pg). Glycine and alanine (1 pg). Palmitic acid (1 pg). Sqalene (1 pg). Pristane (1pg). Chlorobenzene (<1 pg). Dichloromethane (<1 pg). Naphthalene (1 pg). For many missions, Planetary Protection requirements are often implemented in part by processing hardware or potentially entire spacecraft with one or more sterilization processes. These processes are often incompatible with particular materials or components on the spacecraft and extensive effort is made to try to mitigate these issues. Innovative new or improved sterilization/re-sterilization processes are being sought for application to spacecraft hardware to increase effectiveness of reducing bio-load on spacecraft or increase process compatibility with hardware (e.g., toxicity to hardware, temperature, duration, etc.). Accepted processes currently include heat processing, gamma/electron beam irradiation, cold plasma, and vapor hydrogen peroxide. Options to improve materials and parts (e.g., sensors, seals, in particular, batteries, valves, and optical coatings) to be compatible with currently accepted processes, in particular heat tolerance, are needed. NASA is seeking novel technologies for preventing recontamination of sterilized components or spacecraft as a whole (e.g., biobarriers). In addition, active in-situ recontamination/decontamination approaches (e.g., in-situ heating of sample containers to drive off volatiles prior to sample collection) and in-situ sterilization approaches (e.g., UV or plasma) for surfaces are desired. Missions planning sample return from bodies such as Mars, Europa, and Enceladus are faced with developing technologies for sample return functions to assure containment of material from these bodies. Thus far, concepts have been developed specifically for Mars sample return but no end-to-end concepts have been developed that do not have technical challenges remaining in one or more areas. Options for sample canisters with seal(s) (e.g., brazing, explosive welding, soft) with sealing performed either on surface or in orbit and capability to verify seal(s), potentially by leak detection are needed. In addition, capability is needed for opening seals while maintaining sample integrity upon Earth return. These technologies need to be compatible with processes the materials may encounter over the lifecycle of the mission (e.g., high temperature heating). Containment assurance also requires technologies to break-the-chain of contact with the sampled body. Any native contamination on the returned sample container and/or Earth return vehicle must be either be fully contained, sterilized, or removed prior to return to Earth, therefore, technologies or concepts to mitigate this contamination are desired. Lightweight shielding technologies are also needed for meteoroid protection for the Earth entry vehicle and sample canister with capability to detect damage or breach to meet a 10-6 probability of loss of containment.

"TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems",TA4.5 Autonomy,"S3.09Command, Data Handling, and Electronics", GSFC,"NASA's space based observatories, fly-by spacecraft, orbiters, landers, and robotic and sample return missions, require robust command and control capabilities. Advances in technologies relevant to command and data handling and instrument electronics are sought to support NASA's goals and several missions and projects under development. The 2016 subtopic goals are to develop platforms for the implementation of miniaturized highly integrated avionics and instrument electronics that: Are consistent with the performance requirements for NASA science missions. Minimize required mass/volume/power as well as development cost/schedule resources. Can operate reliably in the expected thermal and radiation environments. Successful proposal concepts should significantly advance the state-of-the-art. Proposals should clearly: State what the product is. Identify the needs it addresses. Identify the improvements over the current state of the art. Outline the feasibility of the technical and programmatic approach. Present how it could be infused into a NASA program. Furthermore, proposals developing hardware should indicate an understanding of the intended operating environment, including temperature and radiation. It should be noted that environmental requirements can vary significantly from mission to mission. For example, some low earth orbit missions have a total ionizing dose (TID) radiation requirement of less than 10 krad(Si), while some planetary missions can have requirements well in excess of 1 Mrad(Si). For descriptions of radiation effects in electronics, the proposer may visit (http://radhome.gsfc.nasa.gov/radhome/overview.htm). If a Phase II proposal is awarded, the combined Phase I and Phase II developments should produce a prototype that can be characterized by NASA. The technology priorities sought are listed below: Spaceflight Multicore Middleware - Current and emerging spaceflight processors are leveraging multi-core architectures to satisfy the ever increasing onboard processing demands. These architectures can provide increased processing bandwidth, power efficiency, and fault tolerance for onboard processing applications. However, these advantages come at the cost of increased hardware and software complexity. As software development is a major cost driver for missions, this increased complexity has the potential to significantly increase cost for future NASA missions. To address this risk, this subtopic solicits Spaceflight Multicore Middleware technology providing machine management for multicore processing devices. This middleware software layer shall primarily reside between the application layer and the operating system, with extensions into and below the OS as necessary, to provide intelligent resource, fault, and power management. By providing these functions, application software can be largely agnostic to underlying hardware, thereby reducing cost and complexity. It is desired that the middleware software support multiple processor architectures. Examples include, but not limited to, ARM, Freescale, Tilera, and LEON, and those that support a number of cores ranging from 2-32. Advanced Spaceflight Memory - As spaceflight processor technology advances to provide increased bandwidth, power efficiency, and flexibility, advanced spaceflight memory devices are needed to fully leverage these improvements. This subtopic solicits technologies enabling power efficient, high performance volatile spaceflight memory incorporating high speed, fault tolerant, serial interfaces, internal EDAC, power and fault management, and 2.5/3D manufacturing processes enabling implementation of miniaturized, highly-reliable fault tolerant systems. Point-of-Load Power Converters - Emerging spaceflight processors require multiple supply voltages, and multiple switched services for many of these voltages. Using currently available point-of-load power converters, an unacceptably large portion of future spaceflight computer boards will need to be dedicated for these devices. To address this concern, this subtopic solicits technologies enabling miniaturized spaceflight point-of-load power conversion and switching. Radiation Shielding - Innovative additive manufacturing and/or deposition technologies starting at TRL 3 are sought to create integral one-piece surface claddings of graded atomic number (Z) materials for use as radiation shielding for electronics. Shielding thicknesses must be able to achieve up to 3 g/cm2 for initial shielding applications. At the end of Phase I, delivery of layered slabs and/or half sphere samples is expected with areal densities from 1 -3 g/cm2; samples must be able to show a strong interface property to avoid delamination and consistent density and thickness (areal density) uniformity. This subtopic also solicits technologies enabling the use of COTS micropower/ultra-low power computing devices in highly reliable spacecraft avionics systems. Read less>>"," JPL, LaRC"
"TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems",TA4.5 Autonomy,H6.03Spacecraft Autonomy and Space Mission Automation for Consumables, ARC,"Future human spaceflight missions will place crew’s at large distances and light-time delays from Earth, requiring novel capabilities for crews and ground to manage spacecraft consumables and renewables such as power, water, propellant and life support systems to prevent Loss of Mission (LOM) or Loss of Crew (LOC). This capability is necessary to reconfigure spacecraft, or replan missions, in response to events such as leaks or failures leading to unexpected expenditure of consumables coupled with lack of communications. If crews in the spacecraft must manage, plan and operate much of the mission themselves, NASA must migrate operations functionality from the flight control room to the vehicle for use by the crew. Migrating flight controller tools and procedures to the crew on-board the spacecraft would, even if technically possible, overburden the crew. Enabling these same monitoring, tracking, and management capabilities on-board the spacecraft for a small crew to use will require significant automation and decision support software. Required capabilities to enable future human spaceflight to distant destinations include: Enable on-board crew management of vehicle consumables that are currently flight controller responsibilities. Increase the onboard capability to detect and respond to unexpected consumables-management related events and faults without dependence on ground. Reduce up-front and recurring software costs to produce flight-critical software. Provide more efficient and cost effective ground based operations through automation of consumables management processes, and up-front and recurring mission operations software costs. Necessary capabilities include: Peer-to-peer mission operations planning. Mixed initiative planning systems. Elicitation of mission planning constraints and preferences. Planning system software integration. Space Vehicle System Automation. Autonomous rendezvous and docking software. Integrated discrete and continuous control software. Long-duration high-reliability autonomous system. Power aware computing. Power Systems Autonomous Control. Vehicle Systems Automation. Crew Situational Awareness of Vehicle Automation. Contingency Management. The emphasis of proposed efforts should focus primarily on software systems, but emphasize hardware and operating systems the proposed software will run on (e.g., processors, sensors), and proposals must demonstrate understanding of the consumables and dependent spacecraft systems that the software is intended to manage. Proposals may reference existing fault management techniques, but this subtopic does not solicit development of fault management capability; proposers interested in developing these capabilities are referred to the relevant H6 topic area (H6.04). While Verification, Validation and Requirements of autonomous systems is also an important area, this subtopic does not solicit development of these technologies, proposers interested in developing these capabilities are referred to the relevant H6 topic area (H6.02). Proposals must demonstrate mission operations cost reduction by use of standards, open source software, crew workload reduction, and/or decrease of software integration costs.

"TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems",TA4.5 Autonomy,H6.04Integrating ISHM with Flight Avionics Architectures for Cyber-Physical Space Systems, ARC,"This call for SBIR proposals is for technology development of integrated flight control systems for seamless integration of flight avionics with Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) systems. Flight avionics, with Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) have well-defined Caution and Warning (CW) Fault Detection Isolation and Response (FDIR) alerting systems which in can in real-time detect, isolate and respond to single failures at a time. For each CW failure, a predefined mapping to a CW response procedure is defined. In this way when real time conditions occur, response can be almost immediate. However this approach suffers when more than one failure is present. Under multiple CW failures more than one CW response procedure is active. Which of the predefined procedures should you execute? A procedure execution deadlock can occur. Currently when procedure deadlock occurs a number of questions need to be addressed by flight/ground: At what step in each procedure should you execute first? Should procedure steps be removed /added? Should procedure steps be interleaved between procedures? Should an entirely new procedure by synthesized? The determination of how to proceed from procedure deadlock under multiple failure scenarios is critically dependent upon the correct multiple failure diagnosis of the situation. ISHM supports this determination due to the fact that ISHM can extend traditional CW FDIR systems to utilize a systems view of the spacecraft which leverages all (or most) of the available sensors and command talk-back information. Whereas traditional CW FDIR logic are often small fragments of logic and code which utilize subsets of the sensors, and in general have no knowledge and/or context of the other FDIR algorithms, a global view allows for a global response but also brings additional challenges of determining that the data from all the sensors is consistent. It is also important to recognize that failure signatures/ propagation/fault masking can be the result of not only hardware but also the interaction of the myriad control loops and procedural behavior that is induced by the flight avionics. Another key aspect is to perform interpretation of fault data in the context of mission operations, and subsequent fault recovery consistent with current mission goals. Additional challenges are also to devise methods to automatically develop the ISHM fault models from system descriptions such as the schematics, procedures, etc. To date however seamless integration of ISHM systems with flight avionics CW FDIR systems has not matured to the level such that ISHM systems are trusted to support flight avionics systems in multiple failure high stress situations such as CW storms. Prior human-rated approaches have been proposed but not baselined for similar functional situations in both the Space Shuttle domain (Enhanced Caution and Warning (ECW) as part of the Cockpit Avionics Upgrade (CAU) program) as well as the International Space Station domain (ISS 24-hour autonomy mode). The challenge is to extend the lessons learned from these efforts to achieve program insertion. Such efforts will support both crewed as well as robotic missions, both near Earth as well as deep space missions. Support will be enabled under a variety of conditions including where: Communication time with Earth is insufficient and/or delayed. Communication bandwidth is insufficient. The complexity of analysis is beyond human comprehension. The reliance on a skeleton crew requires additional computational support. Seamless integration can be defined through many dimensions. Several dimensions of interest are: Allow the operator the ability to select between a palette of ISHM modules. Allow the operator the ability to turn on/off the ISHM module. Real time support for flight avionics. At least one scenario should be defined which shows the operation of the flight avionics with and without ISHM. In order to demonstrate a technology solution, proposed work should include as baseline, a representative set of hypothetical CW events, a FDIR procedure response for each CW event, and one or more scenarios where, with multiple CW events across subsystems, the set of applicable FDIR procedures deadlocks. The proposed work should then demonstrate how the procedure deadlock is resolved through the proposed technology solution which integrates ISHM with the flight avionics. Read less>>"," JPL, JSC"
"TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems",TA4.5 Autonomy,H6.02Requirements Management for Spacecraft Autonomy and Space Mission Automation, ARC,"System and software requirements for autonomy have been difficult to define and test due to uncertainties in the environment in which autonomous systems might be deployed, the flexible yet safe interaction with in-situ humans that is needed, and the adaptability needed from an autonomous system for novel situations. Future human spaceflight missions will place crews and other assets at large distances and light-time delays from Earth that will need to act autonomously from mission control over significant time intervals in both nominal and emergency situations. Space missions have small crew sizes, and many mission concepts involve spacecraft and habitats that are only intermittently crewed, so automation through software will be a major portion of autonomous systems. Proposals are solicited that provide novel methods and tools specifically targeted to defining and testing requirements for autonomy capabilities, including the definition of interactions and roles with in-situ humans. Proposals should encompass a subset of the following: methods and tools for autonomy requirement definition, refinement, verification of internal consistency, validation, and testing during subsequent development. Proposals should compare their proposed methods and tools to conventional requirements management, and indicate why their methods and tools will result in requirements for autonomy with less ambiguity, fewer conflicts between different requirements, and more testable requirements - as compared to state of the art requirements methods. Proposals should provide metrics for measuring the quality of autonomy requirements resulting from their methods and tools compared to SOA. For example, in the aircraft industry today over half of system development errors originate during the requirements phase, while over 75% of system development errors are caught very late in development - typically in late phases of testing. This leads to high costs and development schedule overruns due to rework. Proposers should ground their proposed research by demonstrating methods and tools on plausible design reference missions involving autonomy. Proposals should indicate how their methods and tools will bridge the gap between requirements definition and requirements-based testing, potentially including semi-automatic test generation suitable for the autonomy attributes of flexible response in uncertain environments with uncertain situations. Proposals can draw upon a wide range of methods, including but not limited to ontology definition, uncertainty quantification, formal approaches to requirements engineering, symbolic methods for test generation from requirements, and techniques for requirements elicitation from stakeholders. Proposals that involve natural language as a medium for autonomy system and software requirements definition should describe how the natural language will be disambiguated in subsequent phases of system development.

TA5 Communication and Navigation,TA5.1 Optical Comm. And Navigation,S3.08Slow and Fast Light, MSFC,"Steep dispersions in engineered media of a wide variety have opened up a new direction of research in optics. A positive dispersion can be used to slow the propagation of optical pulses to extremely small velocities. Similarly, a negative dispersion can lead to conditions where pulses propagate superluminally. These effects have now moved beyond the stage of intellectual curiosity, and have ushered in studies of a set of exciting applications of interest to NASA, ranging from ultraprecise superluminal gyroscopes to spectral interferometers having enhanced resolving power. This research subtopic seeks slow-light and/or fast-light enhanced sensors for space applications of interest to NASA including: Superluminal gyroscopes and accelerometers (both passive and active) Enhanced strain and displacement sensors for non-destructive evaluation and integrated vehicle health management applications. Slow-light-enhanced spectrally-resolved interferometers for astrophysical and Earth science observations, as well as for exploration goals. Other applications of slow and fast light related to NASA’s mission areas. Superluminal gyroscopes In conventional ring laser gyroscopes, sensitivity increases with cavity size. Fast light, however, can be used to increase gyro sensitivity without having to increase size, for spacecraft navigation systems which are constrained by weight and volume. The increased sensitivity also opens up new science possibilities such as detection of subsurface geological features, tests of Lorentz invariance, improving the bandwidth sensitivity product for gravity wave detection, and tests of general relativity. This research subtopic seeks: Prototype fast light gyroscopes, active or passive, that unambiguously demonstrate a scale factor enhancement of at least 10 with the potential for 1000. The minimum or quantum-noise limited angular random walk (ARW) should also decrease. Designs for fast light gyros that do not require frequency locking, are not limited to operation at specific frequencies such as atomic or material resonances, and permit operation at any wavelength. Fast light gyroscope designs that are rugged, compact, monolithic, rad-hard, and tolerant to variations in temperature and varying G-conditions. Slow-light enhanced spectral interferometers Slow light has the potential to increase the resolving power of spectral interferometers such as Fourier transform spectrometers (FTS) for astrophysical applications without increasing their size. Mariner, Voyager, and Cassini all used FTS instruments for applications such as mapping atmospheres and examining ring compositions. The niche for FTS is usually thought to be for large wavelength (IR and beyond), wide-field, moderate spectral resolution instruments. Slow light, however, could help boost FTS spectral resolution making FTS instruments more competitive with grating-based instruments, and opening up application areas not previously thought to be accessible to FTS instruments, such as exoplanet detection. A slow-light FTS could also be hyper-spectral, providing imaging capability. FTS instruments have been employed for remote sensing on NASA Earth Science missions, such as the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS), Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) experiments, and have long been considered for geostationary imaging of atmospheric greenhouse gases. This research subtopic seeks research and development of slow-light-enhanced spectral interferometers that are not restricted by material resonances and can operate at any wavelength. An inherent advantage of FTS systems are their wide bandwidth. It will therefore of importance to develop slow light FTS systems that can maintain a large operating bandwidth. Read less>>",

TA5 Communication and Navigation,"TA5.4 Position, Navigation, and Timing",H9.03Flight Dynamics and Navigation Systems, GSFC,"NASA is investing in the advancement of software algorithm/stools, systems, and devices to enhance and extend its capabilities for providing position, attitude, and velocity estimates of its spacecraft as well as improve navigation, guidance and control functions to these same spacecraft. Efforts must demonstrate significant risk or cost reduction, significant performance benefit, or enabling capability. Proposals can support mission engineering activities at any stage of development from the concept-phase/pre-formulation through operations and disposal. Applications in low Earth orbit, lunar, and deep space are in scope for this sub-topic. Proposals that could lead to the replacement of the Goddard Trajectory Determination System (GTDS), or leverage state-of-the-art capabilities already developed by NASA such as the General Mission Analysis Tool (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gmat/(link is external)), GPS-Inferred Positioning System and Orbit Analysis Simulation Software, (http://gipsy.jpl.nasa.gov/orms/goa/), Optimal Trajectories by Implicit Simulation (http://otis.grc.nasa.gov/) are especially encouraged.

TA5 Communication and Navigation,TA5.5 Integrated Technologies,H9.02Advanced Space Communication Systems, GRC,"NASA’s future systems require increased levels of adaptive, cognitive, and autonomous system technologies to improve mission communication capabilities for science and exploration. Goals of this capability are to improve communications efficiency, mitigate impairments (e.g., scintillation, interference), and reduce operations complexity and costs through intelligent and autonomous communications and data handling. These goals are further described in the TA05 Communications, Navigation, and Orbital Debris Tracking and Characterization Systems Roadmap, Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.5. Over the past 10 years software defined radio platforms and their applications have emerged and demonstrated the applicability of reconfigurable platforms and applications to space missions. This solicitation seeks advancements in cognitive and automation communication systems, networks, waveforms and components. While there are a number of acceptable definitions of cognitive systems/radio, for simplicity, a cognitive system should sense, detect, adapt, and learn from its environment to improve the communications capabilities and situation for the mission. Cognitive systems naturally lead to advanced multi-function RF platforms; platforms that serve more than one user or function and are reconfigurable, on-demand, either autonomously or by the user for arbitrary applications. NASA can leverage these systems, techniques, hardware, algorithms and waveforms for use in space applications to maximize science data return, enable substantial efficiencies, reduce operations costs, or adapt to unplanned scenarios. While much interest in cognitive radio in other domains focuses on dynamic spectrum access, this subtopic is primarily interested in much broader ways to apply cognition and automation. Areas of interest to develop and/or demonstrate are as follows: System wide intelligence – While much of the current research often describes negotiations and improvements between two radio nodes, the subtopic seeks solutions to understand system wide aspects and impacts of this new technology. Areas of interest include (but not limited to) -cognitive architectures considering mission spacecraft, relay satellites, other user spacecraft, and ground stations, system wide effects to decisions made by one or more communication/navigation elements, handling unexpected or undesired decisions, self-configuring networks, coordination among multiple spacecraft nodes in a multiple access scheme, cooperation and planning among networked space elements to efficiently and securely move data through the system, and automated link planning and scheduling to optimize data throughput and reduce operations costs. Capabilities may include interference mitigation, maximizing data throughput and efficiency, and intelligent network routing (best route) and disruptive tolerant networking over cognitive links. The focus here is on a cognitive understanding of, and adaptation to, temporally or spatially non-contiguous communications paths. Advanced waveform development in the digital domain. Specifically - The foundation has been laid through prior NASA investments in the area of generating the infrastructure for software-based algorithms. These investments led to the development and demonstration of the Space Telecommunication Radio System (STRS) architectural standard for software-defined radios. STRS based advanced backend platforms generate (for transmission) or process (from reception) the appropriate waveform at a common Intermediate Frequency (IF) for transmission to, or reception from, an appropriate RF front-end. In addition, the backend processor is reconfigurable, by the user, for a specific application at a given time (radar vs. short range communications link, etc.). Flexible and adaptive hardware systems - Signal processing platforms, wideband and multi-band adaptive front ends for RF (particularly at S-, X-, and Ka-bands) or optical communications, and other intelligent electronics that advance or enable flexible, cognitive, and intelligent operations. The development and demonstration of advanced RF Front-Ends that cover NASA RF bands of interest; specifically S-Band, X-Band and/or Ka-Band. These RF front-ends may support time-multiplexed waveforms such as radar or (digitized) half-duplex voice transmissions as well as frequency duplexed waveforms such as full-duplex two-way navigation and data communications. Specifically, these front-ends are expected to leverage state-of-the-art RF materials (e.g., GaN, SiC, CMOS, etc.), packaging (e.g., MIC, SMT, etc.), device (e.g., MMIC, MEMS, etc.) and component techniques to minimize mass, volume and energy resource usage while supporting multi-functionality Autonomous Ka-band and/or optical communications antenna pointing - Future mission spacecraft in low Earth orbit may need to access both shared relay satellites in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) and direct to ground stations via Ka-band (25.5-27.0 GHz) and/or optical (1550 nm) communications for high capacity data return. To maximize the use of this capacity, user spacecraft will need to point autonomously and communicate on a coordinated, non-interfering basis along with other spacecraft using these same space- and ground-based assets. Included here are electronically steered antennas, especially at Ka-Band. Applications include large, high-performance electronically-steered antennas required for a dedicated communications relay spacecraft with multiple simultaneous connections, advanced multifunction antennas to support science missions that utilize a multifunction antenna to both communicate and conduct science, and small, lightweight antennas for communications only that provide moderate gain without the use of mechanical steering. Antennas that are reconfigurable in frequency, polarization, and radiation pattern that reduce the number of antennas needed to meet the communication requirements of NASA missions are desired. For all technologies, Phase I will emphasize research aspects for technical feasibility, clear and achievable benefits (e.g., 2x-5x increase in throughput, 25-50% reduction in bandwidth, improved quality of service or efficiency, reduction in operations staff or costs) and show a path towards Phase II hardware/software development with delivery of hardware or software product for NASA. Proposals should demonstrate and explain how and where cognitive and automation technologies could be applied to NASA space systems and be discussed in the proposal. Phase I Deliverables - Feasibility study and concept of operations of the research topic, including simulations and measurements, proving the proposed approach to develop a given product (TRL 3-4). Early development and delivery of the simulation and prototype software and platform(s) to NASA. Plan for further development and verification of specific capabilities or products to be performed at the end of Phase II. Phase II Deliverables - Working engineering model of proposed product/platform or software delivery, along with documentation of development, capabilities, and measurements (showing specific improvement metrics). User’s guide and other documents and tools as necessary for NASA to recreate, modify, and use the cognitive software capability or hardware component(s). Opportunities and plans should also be identified and summarized for potential commercialization or NASA infusion. Software applications and platform/infrastructure deliverables for SDR platforms shall be compliant with the NASA standard for software defined radios, the Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS), NASA-STD-4009 and NASA-HNBK-4009, found at: (https://standards.nasa.gov/documents/detail/3315910).

"TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems",TA6.1 Environmental Control Life Support & Habitation Systems,H3.02Environmental Control and Life Support for Spacecraft and Habitats, ARC,"Solutions and innovations are needed for technology that supports the mass- and energy-efficient maintenance of closed air, water, and waste systems in spacecraft habitats that operate on planetary surfaces such as Mars and that operate in the microgravity environment of space. Three specific focus areas have been identified: New Applications of the Heat Melt Compactor for Contaminant Control and Waste Management NASA is seeking new uses for the Heat Melt Compactor (HMC) to extend its capabilities as a multipurpose/multiuse platform with a focus on addressing the needs for Mars surface and planetary protection. These may include: Membrane bags and/or liner inserts to initially contain unprocessed trash and other wastes within the compactor chamber but that will allow water and gas to pass through during processing. The bags/liners can melt at process temperatures >120° C but upon cooling must encapsulate the solid dry trash and waste for long-term stable storage. The encapsulation of the processed final product should prevent inoculation by external microorganisms. Methods and supporting hardware, including consumables such as membrane bags and/or liner inserts, for safe drying, sterilization and compaction of feces, which allow for water to pass through during processing. Methods and supporting hardware, including consumables such as membrane bags and/or liner inserts, for safely recovering water from urine and wastewater brines. Design and demonstration of a modular subsystem that uses the existing functional capabilities of the HMC as an autoclave. New applications of the HMC are not to be limited to the above aforementioned areas, as new and innovative uses for the HMC are welcome. Other considerations are the benefits that can arise from recycling and reutilization of materials from the trash and waste, and the recovery of useful resources such as water and oxygen. The system must work in the Mars gravity environment with micro-gravity operation highly desirable. A detailed description of the HMC can be found in technical paper number ICES-2014-24, entitled “Generation 2 Heat Melt Compactor Development,” authored by Mark Turner, John Fisher and Greg Pace, 44th International Conference on Environmental Systems, 13-17 July 2014, Tucson, Arizona. The paper is available at the following link: (http://repositories.tdl.org/ttu-ir/handle/2346/59662(link is external)). The HMC was primarily designed to compact and sterilize bulk trash and waste into a reduced volume, stable and sterile hard tile that is impregnated and encapsulated with plastics from the trash. The HMC consists of a nine inch wide cubic chamber (729 cu in) which can be heated to 180 C. Gas pressure in the chamber is controllable between 3 and 14 psia. A ram at one end of the chamber can create compression loads on materials within the chamber from 2000 to 4000 lb force. The downstream effluent processing system can collect approximately 200 ml of water per hour and oxidize noxious/toxic gases that evolve from processed materials. Cleaning Agents and Physicochemical Treatments for Habitat Housekeeping and Laundering Clothes Crew contact surfaces (hand rails, Velcro, acoustic blankets, racks) and food contact surfaces (utensils, table surfaces) are currently cleaned with pre-moistened wipes that are consumable intensive. A mechanism for the in-situ generation of cleaning/sanitizing solutions is needed that will enable these solutions to be applied to reusable fiber based wipes to remove particulate, food, and body oil soiling of surfaces. Solutions must be effective against a range of microbial organisms; their effectiveness against representative organisms must include, but is not limited to, food based bacteria, iodine resistant bacteria, and fecal coliform bacteria. Specific challenges include direct crew contact with cleaning/sanitizing solutions and direct off-gassing and accumulation of solutions in cabin atmosphere. Technologies that can reliably generate, provide short term storage, and dispense cleaning solutions are desired. Prepackaged cleaning solution wipe technologies are not requested. There is currently no space based laundry technology. Traditional laundry surfactants combined with water and substantial agitation can return clothing to near original condition. However, used surfactants result in a substantial organic contaminant burden on downstream wastewater processors. Future space laundry or refreshing systems will not be required to fully restore clothing to its original condition but should enable clothing to be reused a number of times. Current clothing materials include cotton, poly blends, wool, modacrylic, elastic bands, metallic zippers, metallic snaps, Velcro®, Nomex®, Gore-Tex®, and will likely expand to include fabrics present in many current athletic garments. Generation of cleaning solutions or gases for refreshing/sanitizing clothing are needed that address particulate/dander, salts, body oils (such as squaleneor other representative compound), and bacteria that cause odors (including Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Specific challenges include capability to adequately disperse cleansing solutions through a wide range of fibers and materials, minimize mineral and organic load to wastewater processors, and minimal foam generation. Processes are desired that can recover unused cleaning solution or regenerate >70% of consumables. This request is not specifically for the laundry/sanitation device that interacts with the garments. The capabilities of the future laundry device would provide ability to agitate, partially remove liquids, and garment drying. Use of fabric brighteners, fragrances, pearlizers, and other aesthetic compounds are undesirable. Surface treatments that limit biofilm and scaling within water processing system plumbing lines NASA is seeking technologies or surface treatments that limit biofilm and scaling within water processing system plumbing lines. Both laboratory and flight systems have shown a strong tendency towards biofilm formation and occlusion in wastewater collection systems, particularly small diameter plumbing (3-13 mm internal diameter). Accumulation and sloughing of biofilm increases pressure drop, reduces flow rate, and can cause blockage or premature component change out within wastewater piping. Prevention technologies are sought that will limit microbial growth in piping and water recovery system components for up five years but short timeframes are also useful. Periodic inactivation or remediation technologies that use introduced compounds should be capable of being generated in-situ or recovered after use to minimize consumables. Specific challenges include high microbial and total organic carbon loads. Technologies should be effective for wastewater typical of the International Space Station (urine and humidity condensate) as well as exploration ersatz body hygiene wastewater (see “Advanced Life Support Baseline Values and Assumptions Document”, NASA/CR-2004-208941, available at the following link: (http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/CR-2004-208941.pdf)). Proposed solutions should demonstrate compatibility with ISS type water processors, an ability to protect the wastewater system for a long quiescent period in a clean state, and the ability to withstand intermittent exposure to wastewater followed by additional quiescent periods. Additional information on NASA needs can be found in draft 2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps including but not limited to sections TA06 6.1.4.1, TA06 6.1.3.3, TA06 6.1.4.6, TA06 6.1.4.8, and TA07 7.5.2.3.

"TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems",TA6.1 Environmental Control Life Support & Habitation Systems,H14.01International Space Station (ISS) Utilization, JSC,"NASA continues to invest in the near- and mid-term development of highly-desirable systems and technologies that provide innovative ways to leverage existing ISS facilities for new scientific payloads and to provide on orbit analysis to enhance capabilities. Additionally, NASA is supporting commercial science, engineering, and technology to provide low earth orbit commercial opportunities utilizing the ISS. Utilization of the ISS is limited by available up-mass, down-mass, and crew time as well as by the capabilities of the interfaces and hardware already developed and in use. Innovative interfaces between existing hardware and systems, which are common to ground research, could facilitate both increased and faster payload development and subsequent utilization. Technologies that are portable and that can be matured rapidly for flight demonstration on the International Space Station are of particular interest. Desired capabilities that will continue to enhance improvements to existing ISS research and support hardware, with the potential of reducing crew time needs, and those that promote commercial enterprise ventures include but are not limited to, the below examples: Providing additional on-orbit analytical tools. Development of instruments for on-orbit analysis of plants, cells, small mammals and model organisms including Drosophila, C. elegans, and yeast. Instruments to support studies of bone and muscle loss, multi-generational species studies and cell and plant tissue are desired. Providing flight qualified hardware that is similar to commonly used tools in biological and material science laboratories could allow for an increased capacity of on-orbit analysis thereby reducing the number of samples which must be returned to Earth. Instruments that can be used as infrared inspection tools for locating and diagnosing material defects, leaks of fluids and gases, and abnormal heating or electrical circuits. The technology should be suitable for hand-held portable use. Battery powered wireless operation is desirable. Specific issues to be addressed include: pitting from micro-meteoroid impacts, stress fractures, leaking of cooling gases and liquids and detection of abnormal hot spots in power electronics and circuit boards. Innovative technologies and flight projects that can enable significant terrestrial applications from microgravity development or in-space manufacturing and lead to private sector and/or government agency product development within a number of discipline areas, including biotechnology, medical applications, material sciences, electronics, and pharmaceuticals. This includes modifications to existing flight instruments as well as the development of novel flight hardware for deployment on the ISS. For the above, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and prototype hardware development during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration and delivering an engineering development unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract that could be turned into a proof-of-concept system which can be demonstrated in flight. Phase I Deliverables - Written report detailing evidence of demonstrated prototype technology in the laboratory or in a relevant environment and stating the future path toward hardware and software demonstration on orbit.

Phase II Deliverables - Emphasis should be placed on developing and demonstrating hardware and/or software prototype that can be demonstrated on orbit (TRL 8), or in some cases under simulated flight conditions. The proposal shall outline a path showing how the technology could be developed into space-worthy systems. The contract should deliver an engineering development unit for functional and environmental testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.

"TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems",TA6.2 Extravehicular Activity Systems,"H4.01Dust Tolerant, High Pressure Oxygen Quick Disconnect for Advanced Spacesuit and Airlock Applications", JSC,"In order to support the Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) Systems development for more robust operation in LEO as well as enabling operation in the lunar and Martian environments, technology development is required for high pressure oxygen (3750 psia) quick disconnects. The current state of the art space suit ISS EMU Umbilical (IEU) and Service and Cooling Umbilical (SCU) connectors operate at a lower pressure and nearly zero contaminant environment. These next generation of quick disconnects (QDs) will enable the EVA systems to transfer high pressure oxygen between the vehicle and on-board tankage under adverse conditions including vacuum and dust (lunar regolith and Martian soil). The QDs expected operating thermal environment range is -50° F to 150° F. The QDs will limit dust intrusion into the internal flow such that when mated/demated 300 times with the environment per MIL-STD-810G, Method 510.5, Procedure I (Blowing Dust) using lunar soil simulant JSC Lunar-1A or JSC Mars-1A, the internal fluid flow downstream of internal filtration is maintained at Level 100A per JPR 5322.1. After those same mate/demate cycles, the fluid flow range will be 0-12 pph of gaseous oxygen at 2800-3750 psia with an allowable pressure drop of 49 psi. The allowable leakage at 3000 psia is 1 scc/hr oxygen. The QD shall exhibit low mating forces such that it can be mated by crew with gloved hands (wearing a spacesuit with a 4.3 psia or 8.3 psia operating pressure) using simple motions such as push/pull or push-twist/twist-pull. Single handed, gloved operation is preferred. A simple means of indicating positive QD engagement is preferred. The use of accessory tools to aid in QD mate/demate should be avoided if possible. The connector shall be capable of reacting a 125 lbf pull force at the strain relief. There are no specific requirements levied upon the exterior size and complexity of the QDs other to state that they are high criticality items that must be safe, practical, reliable; and a device that an exhausted crew member could operate easily and intuitively. Significant work has been done by NASA to identify a mechanical design for the basic size and operation of the device. Reference material has been attached describing existing and new designs, which NASA expects to heavily influence the general form, fit, and function of the future high pressure quick disconnect. Research done in Phase I of these efforts should focus on technical feasibility with an emphasis on hardware development that can be further expanded in a future Phase II award cycle. Phase II products must include a demonstration unit suitable for testing by NASA. Prototyping should be tailored to applications to ongoing HEO Mission Directorate missions and possible collaborative use in both the governmental and commercial manned spaceflight disciplines. Minimum deliverables at the end of Phase I are analysis and/or test reports, with priority given to functional hardware prototypes for further evaluation. Technical maturation plans should be submitted with Phase I submittals, as well as any expected commercial applications both internal and external to the manned spaceflight enterprise. ISS EMU UMBILICAL (IEU) The ISS EMU Umbilical (Item 498) is an interface between the ISS Umbilical Interface Assembly (UIA) and the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). It provides electrical power and communication, water fill/drain, and water cooling capability from the International Space Station (ISS) for the EMU. The IEU consists of the following items: three water lines of which two are used for water cooling of the LCVG and one for feedwater charging and condensate draining of the PLSS, one oxygen line, one electrical harness assembly for power and communication, a tether restraint and the TMG. The Common Multiple Connector, Item 410, provides a single interface point for connecting and disconnecting the IEU from the DCM. An Umbilical Connector Manifold (UCM), which is government furnished equipment (GFE), provides a single IEU attachment point to the ISS UIA. The IEU provides recharge capability for the PLSS oxygen tank, water reservoir, and battery. In the event a decontamination EVA is needed, the umbilical is designed to withstand environments external to the Airlock. The EMU umbilical terminates at each end with a ganged multiple connector that requires only a single operation to connect or disconnect the umbilical. The outer layer of the IEU is a multi-layer Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment (TMG) to provide thermal insulation and protection from micrometeoroid impacts. The IEU includes a protective pouch that will provides thermal and impact protection for the IEU common multiple connector while disconnected from the EMU. The Umbilical contains a strain relief strap which, during IV operations, attaches via a GFE tether hook to one of the Lower Torso Assembly (LTA) D-rings at the EMU end and to a separate tether ring on the Crew Lock (CL) wall. For EV operations, the hook is disengaged from the UIA panel ring and is secured to a D-ring near the UIA panel. In the event that an EVA decontamination bake out of the EMU is required, this tethering scenario will serve to ensure that UIA design loads are not exceeded. While not in service (i.e., when completely disconnected from the UIA and EMU), the umbilical is stowed in the equipment lock. While attached to the UIA, the umbilical is restrained against the CL wall by GFE provided restraint straps. The useful life (combination of the operational life and shelf life) of the Umbilical is 15 years from the date of PDA. The dry weight of the Umbilical does not exceed 30 lbm. This weight includes all GFE provided hardware (2 tether hooks and the UCM). Service and Cooling Umbilical (SCU) The Service and Cooling Umbilical (Item 400) is an 11-ft umbilical consisting of three water hoses, a high-pressure oxygen hose, electrical harness, bacteria filter assembly, and a strain relief tether. The SCU supplies the PLSS with electrical power, communications, oxygen, waste water drainage and water cooling from the Orbiter during pre- and post-EVA operations. It also supplies the EMU with recharge of the oxygen tanks, water tanks, and battery. The end of the SCU that connects into the airlock panel, otherwise known as the vehicle end of the SCU, consists of the four fluid ECLSS connections in addition to one electrical connector that attaches the SCU to the Orbiter airlock service panel AW82. The connections remain intact between flights and do not require crewmember operation. The vehicle waste water drain and potable water fill lines are connected to the bacteria filter housing located on the airlock wall. On both the drain side and the potable water fill side, a bacteria filter of iodine-impregnated epoxy resin spheres is incorporated, along with a particulate filter made of sintered stainless steel. These filters are used to prevent contamination from passing between the Orbiter ECLSS and the EMU. During normal IVA operations, the Orbiter Waste System is off and there is no ability to dump excess condensate. Approximately one pound of water is drained from the EMU water tanks after filling to allow room for condensate while IVA. The common connector on the EMU end of the SCU combines the four fluid connections and one electrical circuit connector into a single unit operated by the crewmember. Disengagement of the connector is accomplished by pulling out on the SCU connector cam T-handle to retract a locking pin and then rotating the cam handle from the “locked” position approximately 180º to a detent, which is the “open” position. This rotation of the SCU connector cam disengages two pins on the mating is accomplished by pulling out on the SCU connector cam T-handle to retract a locking pin and then rotating the cam handle from the “locked” position approximately 180º to a detent, which is the “open” position. This rotation of the SCU connector cam disengages two pins on the mating connector. Engagement of the connector is accomplished by rotating the SCU connector cam T-handle to the “open” position, engaging the two pins on the mating connector with the cam, and then rotating the cam handle from the “open” position approximately 180º to the “locked” position, where a cam locking pin is engaged. The SCU is stowed on the airlock wall when it is not being used. The common connector (SCU side) is attached to a mating stowage connector on the EMU mount (AAP). The SCU is unstowed and connected to the DCM during EMU donning to provide vehicle consumables for the suited EVA preparation activities in the airlock until life support from the EMU is initiated. Nominally, the SCU is disconnected at an airlock pressure of zero psia during airlock depressurization prior to an EVA and reconnected at an airlock pressure of zero psia during airlock re-pressurization after an EVA. The life support from the SCU is maintained during the suited post-EVA activities until the start of EMU doffing. The SCU is also connected to the EMU to supply Orbiter consumables for recharge of the EMU oxygen, the water tanks, and the battery.

"TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems",TA6.2 Extravehicular Activity Systems,H4.02Trace Contaminant Control for Advanced Spacesuit Applications, JSC,"This subtopic is in search of a trace contaminant control (TCC) technology to remove trace contaminants in an advanced spacesuit atmosphere, specifically considering power, size, and removal capability. The advanced spacesuit portable life support system (PLSS) performs the functions required to keep an astronaut alive during an extravehicular activity (EVA) including maintaining thermal control, providing a pressurized oxygen (O2) environment, and removing carbon dioxide (CO2). The PLSS ventilation subsystem performs the transport and provides the conditioned O2 to the suit for pressurization and astronaut breathing. It circulates O2 through the ventilation loop using a fan and recycles the ventilation gas, removing CO2 and providing humidity control. The ventilation subsystem is also responsible for removing trace contaminants from the spacesuit atmosphere. The International Space Station extravehicular mobility unit uses an activated charcoal bed inside the CO2 removal bed (lithium hydroxide (LiOH) and metal oxide (MetOx) canisters). The charcoal in the MetOx canisters can be regenerated on-orbit. The selection of the rapid cycle amine (RCA) swingbed for CO2 removal in the baseline advanced spacesuit PLSS has added a risk for removing trace contaminants. The trace contaminants in the PLSS ventilation subsystem and their predicted concentrations (mg/m3) at the end of an 8-hour EVA without suit leakage include the following: acetaldehyde (0.181), acetone (0.301), ammonia (564), n-Butanol (1.13), carbon monoxide (74.4), ethyl alcohol (9.03), formaldehyde (0.902), furan (0.676), hydrogen (113), methyl alcohol (3.16), methane (1352), and Toulene (1.36). The predictions are based on EVA-specific generation rates.1 Based on these predictions ammonia and formaldehyde are the two contaminants most likely to exceed Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentration levels if no TCC device is in the PLSS ventilation loop. It would be beneficial for the technology to be regenerable such as vacuum swing regeneration. In particular, a vacuum-regenerable TCC device that can be regenerated in real time on the suit using a vacuum swing with 1 to 3 min of exposure would be optimum. Additional items for optimization include: reduction in expendables and incorporation into integrated CO2 removal/reduction system. The desire is for the TCC system to be an immediate knock-down of inlet contaminants such as aldehydes which react irreversibly with the RCA sorbent. This will decrease the likelihood of losing capacity over the life of the system to these types of reactions. Research done in Phase I of these efforts should focus on technical feasibility with an emphasis on hardware development that can be further expanded in a future Phase II award cycle. Phase II products must include a demonstration unit suitable for testing by NASA. Prototyping should be tailored to applications to ongoing HEO Mission Directorate missions and possible collaborative use in both the governmental and commercial manned spaceflight disciplines. Minimum deliverables at the end of Phase I are analysis and/or test reports, with priority given to functional hardware prototypes for further evaluation.

"TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems",TA6.2 Extravehicular Activity Systems,"H4.03EVA Space Suit Power, Avionics, and Software Systems", JSC,"Space suit power, avionics and software (PAS) advancements are needed to extend EVA capability on ISS beyond 2020, as well as future human space exploration missions. NASA is presently developing a space suit system called the Advanced Extravehicular Mobility Unit (AEMU). The AEMU PAS system is responsible for power supply and distribution for the overall EVA system, collecting and transferring several types of data to and from other mission assets, providing avionics hardware to perform numerous data display and in-suit processing functions, and furnishing information systems to supply data to enable crew members to perform their tasks with autonomy and efficiency. Current space suits are equipped with radio transmitters/receivers so that spacewalking astronauts can talk with ground controllers and/or other astronauts. The astronauts wear headsets with microphones and earphones. The transmitters/receivers are located in the backpacks worn by the astronauts only operate in the UHF band. While a sufficient amount of radiation hardened electronics are available in areas such as serial processors, digital memory and Field Programmable Gate Arrays, certain ancillary electronic devices present a significant risk for the development of rad-hard spacesuit avionics. NASA is, therefore, seeking flight rated electronic devices needed to complement the existing inventory of flight rated parts so as to enable the creation of an advanced avionics suite for spacesuits. The suit and its corresponding avionics should be capable of being stowed inside a spacecraft outside the low-Earth orbit (LEO) environment for periods of up to 5 years (TBR). Devices should also be capable of supporting EVA sorties of at least 8 hours and total lifetime operational durations of at least 2300 hours (TBR) for a Mars surface mission. Assumptions may be made for inherent radiation shielding provided by the primary life-support system (PLSS) and possibly the power, avionics, and software (PAS) subsystem enclosure, but proposers are welcome to include shielding technologies at the board and individual part level to reduce the radiation requirements of the actual device. Devices should be immune to single event latch-up (SEL) for particles with Linear Energy Transfer (LET) values of at least 75 Mev-cm2/mg. and maintain full functionality for total ionizing doses of at least 20 Krad (Si). Criticality 1 devices (life support) must be fully mitigated against single event errors (SEE) for all potential mission radiation environments, including solar flares. Lower criticality devices can be less tolerant of SEEs, but must still operate with acceptable error rates in all potential radiation environments. Power consumption should be no more than 2X similar COTS or mil-spec devices. Devices should be vacuum compatible and need to support conduction cooling. Need currently exists for a number of devices, as described below. However this list should not be considered to be exhaustive and proposals will be considered for other devices that are peculiar to a spacesuit avionics suite. Additionally, proposals are invited for simplified, low-cost and low-impact methods to adapt or test commercial or military-spec devices so as to yield a flight-rated part to the above levels. In order of priority, two key innovations are sought this round: Safety Critical Switches and Controls - Very low profile switches and controls for EVA Criticality 1 systems. Highly reliable and robust devices that provide traditional toggle switch, rotary dial, and linear slider control functionality in a very low profile package which permits higher packaging density compared to traditional solutions for vacuum space operations. Switches and controls must still be sized for easy operation with EVA gloves. Wireless Communication - Dual-band WLAN-class RF front-end module capable of supporting the SSCS (410 to 420 MHz) and the ISS External Wireless Communications system (5.25-5.35GHz). This module is expected to contain all RF components plus data converters. This module will interface with a baseband processing unit via high-speed digital interface. Consideration for supporting multiple antennas on the EWC band will be given, but this is not required. The front-end must be able to operate in the ISS environment. Research done in Phase I of these efforts should focus on technical feasibility with an emphasis on hardware development that can be further expanded in a future Phase II award cycle. Phase II products must include a demonstration unit suitable for testing by NASA. Prototyping should be tailored to applications to ongoing HEO Mission Directorate missions and possible collaborative use in both the governmental and commercial manned spaceflight disciplines. Minimum deliverables at the end of Phase I are analysis and/or test reports, with priority given to functional hardware prototypes for further evaluation.

"TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems",TA6.3 Human Health and Performance,H12.02Passive Vital Sign Monitoring, ARC,"Human exploration missions beyond low earth orbit (LEO) require physiologic monitoring of the crew. These highly mass, volume, and power constrained missions require significant leveraging of resources by all vehicle subsystems. To date, research and development resources involving physiologic monitoring have been allocated to crew worn devices to measure these physiologic parameters. NASA recognizes that there are numerous worn devices that provide monitoring, but all of these devices still require mass, volume, power, and crew time to operate. The exploration vehicle, however, will already provide a variety of technologies that could potentially be used to extrapolate human physiologic data in a more passive and continuous manner that does not require additional mass, volume, power, and crew time to operate. Examples of technology embedded within the vehicle include, but are not limited to, high quality video and audio, wireless networks, radio frequency identification, and other electromagnetic (EM) sources/detectors. NASA requires new technologies that will exploit vehicle infrastructure to passively and continuously monitor the crew’s physiologic parameters. NASA is amenable to improving existing vehicle technologies to extract crew data, but also for incorporating novel and innovative technologies that could be added to the vehicle or the crew. Examples of technology developments can include, but are not limited to, heart and respiration rate detection via HD video, temperature detection via infrared camera, or circadian rhythm phase detection via automated urine analysis. Some of the parameters that would be desirable for monitoring include: Heart Rate. Oxygen Saturation Level. Respiration Rate. Blood Pressure (diastolic/systolic). Core and/or Skin Temperature. Urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin. A list of anticipated medical conditions that would require monitoring can be found on the Exploration Medical Condition list (EMCL), which may be found on NASA’s Human Research Wiki: (https://humanresearchwiki.jsc.nasa.gov/index.php?title=ExMC).

"TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems",TA6.3 Human Health and Performance,H12.01Task Analysis Visualization and Data Management Tool, JSC,"Task analysis (TA) is a method within the Human-Centered Design process that represents tasks as sequences or concurring steps and actions that are necessary to accomplish goals. It is used to understand and document the sequence of tasks, steps, and the relationship among these in order to indicate how the user or uses performing them. Furthermore, most major NASA programs, such as Orion, call for TA in the verification process. The output of the TA is a Master Task List (MTL) that feeds into design, models, and databases. Designers use the MTL to design systems, subsystems, and components to accommodate crew tasks. Operations personnel use the MTL for operations concepts and crew procedures development. This solicitation invites proposals intending to develop methods and technologies to manage and visualize TA information. Although recognized as a critical function in design, task analysis is often erroneously overlooked until final design phases when hardware, system, and software designs are too costly to change. It is essential that task analysis be conducted as early in the design process as possible. Task analysis should be conducted iteratively and should be frequently evaluated throughout the design and development process to allow for proper verification of crew task and system design. Furthermore, task analysis should be performed to identify the “critical” tasks, i.e., those tasks that are necessary to successfully accomplish operations and mission objectives. Function allocation is also an important part of task analysis: deciding whether a particular function will be accomplished by the human or the system, or by some combination of humans and systems. Task analyses for long-duration missions will result in a complex structure of tasks and sub-tasks. Master task lists can contain thousands of tasks that have complex temporal and sequential relations among them that need to be visualized. In order to use the results of a complex task analysis efficiently, there is a need for a robust visualization tool that helps with overviewing, sorting, and interpreting the results. Available commercial tools are not able to deal with the complexity of long-duration mission task analysis data due to the following limitations: cannot easily show simultaneous tasks and tasks performed by multiple operators, difficult to track changes, difficult to search for tasks, few/no summary options, and few/no file export options. The tool should improve task design and system design by relating tasks and sequences of tasks in an efficient way, making the data more usable and ultimately improving overall design. Phase I Deliverables - Conceptual prototype of a task analysis data management and visualization tool and final report detailing the conceptual prototype and software development plan including feature and display requirements.

"TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems",TA6.3 Human Health and Performance,H12.03Novel Imaging Technologies for Space Medicine, GRC,"NASA is seeking novel medical imaging techniques in two areas: software-based ultrasound and portable x-ray. Software-Based Ultrasound Ultrasound has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, NASA’s workhorse modality for internal imaging in space. Ultrasound’s smaller footprint, lower power consumption and lower emissions across the electromagnetic spectrum make it particularly well-suited for space medicine. Ultrasound also provides additional medically useful capabilities outside the realm of imaging, such as quantitative ultrasound diagnostic techniques, and therapeutic techniques that utilize the energy in the ultrasound signal itself. NASA’s commitment to ultrasound has led to the development of the Flexible Ultrasound System (FUS), which is a software-based, state of the art clinical scanner specially adapted to support the development of novel research in ultrasound. The FUS may be thought of as an “ultrasound development platform”. It features software-based beam forming, scanning and receiving on up to 192 channels, dual-probe operation, high power support, and full access to the radio frequency (RF) data. Developers using the FUS may implement their algorithms and techniques in an Application Programming Interface (API) that supports both Matlab and C++. The ground-based demonstration of the FUS will begin in April of 2016 and will potentially last for several years. NASA requires novel ultrasound-based diagnostic and therapeutic techniques for diagnosing and/or treating conditions on the Exploration Medical Condition List (EMCL), which can be found on NASA’s Human Research Wiki at – (https://humanresearchwiki.jsc.nasa.gov/index.php?title=ExMC). NASA is amenable to improving existing uses of ultrasound for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, but also for completely novel and innovative uses of ultrasound for diagnosis or treatment of any conditions on the EMCL. These novel techniques, which can include both hardware and software, should be developed with integration onto the FUS in mind, either by direct development on a system loaned to the developer by NASA or by porting the application from another system to the FUS at a later stage in the grant. Current examples of FUS integration include novel probe and algorithm development to quantify bone density and efforts to move/break up renal stones. Portable X-Ray Although ultrasound remains NASA’s workhorse modality for internal imaging of body parts on spaceflight missions, there are gaps in ultrasound’s ability to diagnose certain medical conditions that might arise during spaceflight, particularly to deep space destinations. Ultrasound is not as well suited to diagnosing dental conditions and certain musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries as traditional radiographic (x-ray) techniques. A set of limiting factors have precluded the use of x-ray devices on-orbit. These limitations include the relatively higher volumetric footprint, higher power requirements and higher electromagnetic (EM) emissions (particularly ionizing radiation, both in terms of dosage delivered to the crew and stray emissions) of x-ray devices and other imaging devices. NASA needs new technology developments to overcome these limitations and ensure the diagnosis of dental and MSK conditions are more compatible with human spaceflight. NASA is amenable to improvements in existing x-ray devices and/or other novel and innovative imaging technologies. Example technology developments include, but are not limited to, those leading to more efficient x-ray sources, more sensitive detector technologies, improving image quality, reducing delivered EM dosage, and expanding the usefulness of handheld portable x-ray devices and other imaging devices to address dental and MSK conditions. A complete list of dental and MSK conditions can be found on the Exploration Medical Condition list (EMCL), which may be found on NASA’s Human Research Wiki - (https://humanresearchwiki.jsc.nasa.gov/index.php?title=ExMC). Proposals should address one of the two aforementioned technology areas. The expected deliverables for Phase I for the software-based ultrasound are: Conceptual prototype of a novel device/algorithm. Final report detailing the conceptual prototype and hardware/software development plans. The expected deliverables for Phase II are: Completed FUS device/algorithm. Integrated testing on FUS platform. Final report on the development, testing, and validation of the tool. The expected deliverables for Phase I for the portable x-ray are: Conceptual prototype of an imaging device. Final report detailing the conceptual prototype and hardware/software development plans. The expected deliverables for Phase II are: Completed imaging device. Final report on the development and testing of the tool. Read less>>", JSC
"TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems",TA6.5 Radiation,H11.01Radiation Shielding Technologies - Transport Codes, LaRC,"Advanced radiation shielding technologies are needed to protect humans from the hazards of space radiation during future NASA missions. All space radiation environments in which humans may travel in the foreseeable future are considered, including the Moon, Mars, asteroids, geosynchronous orbit (GEO), and low Earth orbit (LEO). All particulate radiations are considered, particularly galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), solar energetic particles (SEP), and secondary neutrons. For this 2016 solicitation, the special interest is in advanced space radiation transport codes. Mid-TRL (3 to 5) technologies of specific interest include, but are not limited to, the following: Computational tools that enable the evaluation of the transport of space radiation through highly complex vehicle architectures as represented in detailed computer-aided design (CAD) models are needed. A number of codes and computational packages currently exist that can be used to assess the transport of the diverse particle and energy spectra of the space environment through shielding materials. However, using these transport codes on geometry represented by complex CAD models requires considerable human intervention. Computational tools that automate vehicle ray tracing for use with the NASA-developed HZETRN space radiation transport code are needed to enable vehicle dose mapping and a larger vehicle optimization capability. Tools that enable the use of Monte-Carlo transport codes with native CAD geometry could also make it possible to perform radiation analyses for space architectures using multiple transport codes. Phase I deliverables are alpha-tested computer codes. Phase II deliverables are beta-tested computer codes.

TA7 Human Exploration Destination Systems,TA7.1 In-Situ Resource Utilization,H1.01In situ Resource Utilization - Production of Feedstock for Manufacturing and Construction, JSC,"The overall goal of in-situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) is to transform available resources, both natural and man-made, on extraterrestrial surfaces into usable materials and products that assist in sustaining and growing human exploration capabilities. ISRU involves all the steps associated with identifying, collecting, and converting local resources into products that can reduce mission mass, cost, and/or risk. It is imperative that novel technologies be developed to effectively utilize these resources for mission critical consumables, as well as to produce feedstock for additive manufacturing of replacement parts, construction for habitat, and infrastructure expansion. In the case of Mars, carbon dioxide and other atmospheric constituents, along with regolith and water/ice can be harvested for basic elements that could be utilized to generate various simple and complex organic and inorganic compounds, composites and products. The subtopic seeks proposals for critical technologies associated with the design, fabrication, and testing of hardware associated with one or more of the areas of interest below: Plastic production for in-space additive manufacturing - Production of plastic that can be fed into in space manufacturing devices. Define and demonstrate all steps required for conversion of some or all of the following in-situ constituents (H2, CO, CO2, O2, N2, and CH4) into a final plastic product. It is expected that intermediate products, such as longer chain hydrocarbons, alcohols, aromatics, etc. will be required to achieve final plastic production. Proposals will need to identify all the steps and intermediate products. Phase I proposals will need to demonstrate critical steps, especially the first step from the list of starting constituents. Each step in Phase I can be performed/demonstrated individually. Phase II proposals will need to demonstrate all steps in an integrated manner. Production rates for plastic production will initially be low at 1 to 5 kg/day. Ability to breakdown and recycle the plastic produced is desired but not required. If additional constituents are required to make in-situ plastic, proposer can include them but will need to identify whether the constituents can be obtained in-situ or needs to be brought from Earth. Information on thermoplastic feedstock glass transition temperature and melting point properties for 3D printer plastic feedstocks that might be useful can be found at: (http://3dprintingfromscratch.com/common/3d-printer-filament-types-overview/(link is external)). Since the loads and environments of the parts made using the feedstock are not known at this time, it is recommended that the properties be commensurate with commercially available feedstocks. Some desired characteristics of the parts made from the feedstock are high temperature resistance, low moisture adsorption, and ability to bond using adhesives. Feedstock produced must be tested in a commercially available additive manufacturing device in Phase II. Metal extraction from extraterrestrial material for additive manufacturing - Metal extraction from extraterrestrial material including lunar regolith, Mars soil, and ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites asteroidal material. Regeneration of any reactants used in the metal extraction process is required. Metals found in extraterrestrial material such as iron, aluminum, silicon, magnesium, and nickel are desired for future in-situ additive manufacturing. It is not expected that the quality and purity of the extracted metals will be to the same standard obtained from terrestrial processes so proposer needs to consider the possible extraction method and subsequent purity of the feedstock. In Phase I, the proposer is required to demonstrate the feasibility of extracting the desired feedstock. Methods used for extraction can be physical/chemical or biological. In Phase II, these feed stocks should be ready for introduction into a fabrication process by being pre-processed to have appropriate physical properties and forms (e.g., granulated, spooled wire, plate, billet, ingots, etc.). Manufacturing processes should be identified and feasibility demonstrated using the regolith derived feed stocks in partial and/or micro gravity environments. Regolith acquisition and delivery of up to 100 kg/hour can be assumed as an input material stream. Using a waste stream from another ISRU process to produce feedstock for fabrication may be considered such as regolith that has already been processed to extract water or oxygen from minerals. ISRU for additive construction techniques - Bulk or modified regolith can also be used as a construction material (with or without a binder) to form a material that can be extruded to produce a floor, structural wall, or ceiling, or into bricks or slabs for landing pads, roads, and shielding. These construction material can be used for making structures, shelters, radiation shielding, and thermal shading and for micrometeorite protection. Binders and additives must be less than 10% by mass of the construction material feedstock. Use of binders that can also be produced in-situ are preferred. Use of water is not excluded, but steps to be taken mitigate losses and amounts used and lost must be clarified to compare to non-water based construction materials. In Phase II, demonstration of the feasibility of additive construction using construction material feedstock is required (demonstration in partial or micro gravity environments is desired). For extruded materials a linear printing rates 30 to 100 cm/minute is desired. Bricks and slabs should have ability to be joined or interlocked. All proposals need to identify the state-of-the-art of applicable technologies and processes. Proposals must address the physical/mineral properties of the regolith/soil used. Proposers must specify whether the process is performed in batches or by continuous processing with appropriate sealing techniques to minimize reactant/product losses identified.

"TA8 Science Instruments, Observatories & Sensor Systems",TA8.1 Science Instruments,S2.02Precision Deployable Optical Structures and Metrology, JPL,"Planned future NASA Missions in astrophysics, such as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and the New Worlds Technology Development Program (coronagraph, external occulter and interferometer technologies) will push the state of the art in current optomechanical technologies. Mission concepts for New Worlds science would require 10 - 30 m class, cost-effective telescope observatories that are diffraction limited at wavelengths from the visible to the far IR, and operate at temperatures from 4 - 300 K. In addition, ground based telescopes such as the Cerro Chajnantor Atacama Telescope (CCAT) requires similar technology development. The desired areal density is 1 - 10 kg/m2 with a packaging efficiency of 3-10 deployed/stowed diameter. Static and dynamic wavefront error tolerances to thermal and dynamic perturbations may be achieved through passive means (e.g., via a high stiffness system, passive thermal control, jitter isolation or damping) or through active opto-mechanical control. Large deployable multi-layer structures in support of sunshades for passive thermal control and 20m to 50m class planet finding external occulters are also relevant technologies. Potential architecture implementations must package into an existing launch volume, deploy and be self-aligning to the micron level. The target space environment is expected to be the Earth-Sun L2. This subtopic solicits proposals to develop enabling, cost effective component and subsystem technology for deploying large aperture telescopes with low cost. Research areas of interest include: Precision deployable structures and metrology for optical telescopes (e.g., innovative active or passive deployable primary or secondary support structures). Architectures, packaging and deployment designs for large sunshields and external occulters. In particular, important subsystem considerations may include: Innovative concepts for packaging fully integrated subsystems (e.g., power distribution, sensing, and control components). Mechanical, inflatable, or other precision deployable technologies. Thermally-stable materials (CTE < 1ppm) for deployable structures. Innovative systems, which minimize complexity, mass, power and cost. Innovative testing and verification methodologies. The goal for this effort is to mature technologies that can be used to fabricate 16 m class or greater, lightweight, ambient or cryogenic flight-qualified observatory systems. Proposals to fabricate demonstration components and subsystems with direct scalability to flight systems through validated models will be given preference. The target launch volume and expected disturbances, along with the estimate of system performance, should be included in the discussion. Proposals with system solutions for large sunshields and external occulters will also be accepted. A successful proposal shows a path toward a Phase II delivery of demonstration hardware scalable to 5 meter diameter for ground test characterization. Before embarking on the design and fabrication of complex space-based deployable telescopes, additional risk reduction in operating an actively controlled telescope in orbit is desired. To be cost effective, deployable apertures that conform to a cubesat (up to 3-U) or ESPA format are desired. Consequently, deployment hinge and latching concepts, buildable for these missions and scaleable to larger systems are desired. Such a system should allow <25 micron deployment repeatability and sub-micron stability for both thermal and mechanical on-orbit disturbances. A successful proposal would deliver a full-scale cubesat or ESPA ring compatible deployable aperture with mock optical elements. Proposals should show an understanding of one or more relevant science needs, and present a feasible plan to fully develop the relevant subsystem technologies and to transition into future NASA program(s).

Examples include planetary systems beyond our own, the detailed inner structure of galaxies with very bright nuclei, binary star formation, and stellar evolution. Contrast ratios of one million to ten billion over an angular spatial scale of 0.05-1.5 arcsec are typical of these objects. Achieving a very low background requires control of both scattered and diffracted light. The failure to control either amplitude or phase fluctuations in the optical train severely reduces the effectiveness of starlight cancellation schemes. This innovative research focuses on advances in coronagraphic instruments, starlight cancellation instruments, and potential occulting technologies that operate at visible and near infrared wavelengths. The ultimate application of these instruments is to operate in space as part of a future observatory mission. Measurement techniques include imaging, photometry, spectroscopy, and polarimetry.

"TA8 Science Instruments, Observatories & Sensor Systems",TA8.1 Science Instruments,S1.09Cryogenic Systems for Sensors and Detectors, GSFC,"Cryogenic cooling systems often serve as enabling technologies for detectors and sensors flown on scientific instruments as well as advanced telescopes and observatories. As such, technological improvements to cryogenic systems further advance the mission goals of NASA through enabling performance (and ultimately science gathering) capabilities of flight detectors and sensors. There are four potential investment areas that NASA is seeking to expand state of the art capabilities for possible use on future programs such as WFirst (http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/), the Europa Jupiter System Science missions (http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/podcasting/jpl-europa20090218.html) and PIXIE (Primordial Inflation Explorer). The topic areas are as follows: Cryocooler Systems and Components Miniaturized/Efficient Cryocooler Systems - Cryocooler systems viable for application on SmallSat space platforms are sought. Present state of the art capabilities demonstrate approximately 0.4W of cooling capacity at 77K provided an input power of 5W. Contemporary system mass is on the order of 400 grams. Desired performance specifications for cryocoolers sought include a cooling capability on the order of 0.2W at temperatures spanning 30K - 80K. Desired masses and input powers will be < 400 grams and < 5W respectively. Component level improvements are also desirable. Low Temperature/Input Power Cooling Systems - Low temperature/Input Power Cooling systems are sought for application on future Planetary missions that require performance in space environments that have limited access to power. Contemporary cooling systems are incapable of providing cooling loads as high as 0.2W at 30K while rejecting heat to an ambient environment of approximately 150K. Cooling systems providing cooling capacities of approximately 0.3W at 35K with heat rejection capability to temperature sinks at 150 K or lower are of interest. Component level improvements are also desirable. High Capacity/Efficiency Cryocooler Systems - High Capacity/Efficiency cryocoolers are of interest for use on future science missions. State of the art high capacity cryocooler systems have demonstrated cooling capabilities spanning 0.3W - 1W with a load temperature of 20K and < 0.3 W at 10K. High Capacity cryocoolers are available at low to mid TRL levels for both Pulse Tube (e.g., 5W cooling capacity at 20K) and Turbo Brayton (e.g., cooling capacity of 20W at 20K) configurations. Desired cryocooler systems will provide cold tip operational temperatures spanning 10K to 20K with a cooling capacity of > 4W at 20K or more than 0.3 W at 10 K. Very low vibration systems with these capabilities are desirable. Component level improvements that increase overall efficiency are also desirable. Sub-Kelvin Cooling Systems Magnetic Cooling Systems - State of the art sub-Kelvin temperature control architectures that use magnetic cooling consist of ADR (Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigeration) systems. The Astro-H FM (Flight Model) ADR represents the state of the art in ADR system and component level technologies for space application. Future missions requiring cooling to sub-Kelvin levels will look to use new and improved ADR systems. AMRR (Active Magnetic Regenerative Refrigeration) systems are a related magnetic cooling technology that requires system and component level development in order to attain sub-Kelvin cooling levels. Improvements at the component level may lead to better overall system performance and increased hold times at target temperatures. Both of these are highly advantageous and desirable to future science missions. Specific components sought include: Low current superconducting magnets (3-4 Tesla at temperatures > 15K). Heat Switches (including optimization of current designs, such as low thermal conductivity heat switch shells) High cooling power density magnetocaloric materials, especially single crystals with volume > 20 cm3.

Technology to fabricate, test and control potential UUV, UV/O or Far-IR telescopes. Please note: an emphasis regarding mirror systems is the mirror substrate support structure. The Technical Challenges contains information on specific technologies which need developing for each area. Proposals must show an understanding of one or more relevant science needs, and present a feasible plan to develop the proposed technology for infusion into a NASA program: sub-orbital rocket or balloon; competed SMEX or MIDEX; or, Decadal class mission. This subtopic matures technologies needed to affordably manufacture, test or operate complete mirror systems or telescope assemblies. Traditionally, this subtopic matured technology from TRL3 to TRL4. Now, there is an additional opportunity to propose in Phase II for an effort larger than a traditional Phase II for the purpose of maturing demonstrated component level technologies (TRL4) to demonstrated system level technologies (TRL6) by using them to manufacture complete telescope systems. A requirement of this option is that there must be an identified NASA program that will fly the developed new technology system. An ideal Phase I deliverable would be a precision optical system of at least 0.25 meters; or a relevant sub-component of a system; or a prototype demonstration of a fabrication, test or control technology leading to a successful Phase II delivery; or a reviewed preliminary design and manufacturing plan which demonstrates feasibility. While detailed analysis will be conducted in Phase II, the preliminary design should address how optical, mechanical (static and dynamic) and thermal designs and performance analysis will be done to show compliance with all requirements. Past experience or technology demonstrations which support the design and manufacturing plans will be given appropriate weight in the evaluation. An ideal Phase II project would further advance the technology to produce a flight-qualifiable optical system greater than 0.5 meters or relevant sub-component (with a TRL in the 4 to 5 range); or a working fabrication, test or control system. Phase I and Phase II mirror system or component deliverables would be accompanied by all necessary documentation, including the optical performance assessment and all data on processing and properties of its substrate materials. A successful mission oriented Phase II would have a credible plan to deliver for the allocated budget a fully assembled and tested telescope assembly which can be integrated into the potential mission; and, demonstrate an understanding of how the engineering specifications of their system meets the performance requirements and operational constraints of the mission (including mechanical and thermal stability analysis). Successful proposals will demonstrate an ability to manufacture, test and control ultra-low-cost optical systems that can meet science performance requirements and mission requirements (including processing and infrastructure issues). Material behavior, process control, active and/or passive optical performance, and mounting/deploying issues should be resolved and demonstrated. Introduction The 2010 National Academy Astro2010 Decadal Report specifically identified large light-weight mirrors as a key technology needed to enable potential Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV), Ultraviolet/Optical (UV/O) and Infrared (IR) to Far-IR missions. The 2012 National Academy report “NASA Space Technology Roadmaps and Priorities” states that one of the top technical challenges in which NASA should invest over the next five years is developing a new generation of larger effective aperture, lower-cost astronomical telescopes that enable the discovery of habitable planets, facilitate advances in solar physics, and enable the study of faint structures around bright objects. Finally, NASA is developing a heavy lift space launch system (SLS) with an 8 to 10 meter fairing and 40 to 50 mt capacity to SE-L2. SLS will enable extremely large space telescopes, such as 12 to 30 meter class segmented primary mirrors for UV/optical or infrared wavelengths. Technical Challenges To accomplish NASA’s high-priority science requires low-cost, ultra-stable, large-aperture, normal incidence mirrors with low mass-to-collecting area ratios. Specifically needed for a potential UVO mission are normal incidence 4-meter (or larger) diameter mirrors with 5 nm RMS surface figure error; and, active or passive alignment and control of normal-incidence imaging systems to achieve diffraction limited performance at wavelengths less than 500 nm (< 40 nm RMS wavefront error, WFE). Additionally, potential Exoplanet mission, using an internal coronagraph, requires total telescope wavefront stability on order of 10 pico-meters RMS per 10 minutes. This stability specification places severe constraints on the dynamic mechanical and thermal performance of 4 meter and larger telescope. To meet this performance requirement requires ultra-stable mirror support structures. Finally, specifically needed for potential IR/Far-IR missions are normal incidence 8-meter (or larger) diameter mirrors with cryo-deformations < 100 nm rms. In all cases, the most important metric for an advanced optical system (after performance) is affordability or areal cost (cost per square meter of collecting aperture). Current normal incidence space mirrors cost $4 million to $6 million per square meter of optical surface area. This research effort seeks a cost reduction for precision optical components by 5 to 50 times, to between $100K/m2 to $1M/m2. Development is required to fabricate components and systems to achieve the following Metrics: Areal Cost < $500K/m2 (for UV/Optical). Areal Cost < $100K/m2 (for Infrared). Monolithic - 1 to 8 meters. Segmented > 4 meters (total aperture). Wavefront Figure < 5 nm RMS (for UV/Optical). Cryo-deformation < 100 nm RMS (for Infrared). Slope < 0.1 micro-radian (for EUV). Wavefront Stability < 10 pm/10 min (for Coronagraphy). Actuator Resolution < 1 nm rms (UV/Optical). Finally, also needed is ability to fully characterize surface errors and predict optical performance. Read less>>"," GSFC, JPL"

Coating technologies for X-Ray, EUV, Visible, and IR telescopes. Free-form Optics surfaces design, fabrication, and metrology. This subtopic focuses on three areas of technology development: X-Ray manufacturing, coating, testing, and assembling complete mirror systems in addition to maturing the current technology. Coating technology for wide range of wavelengths from X-Ray to IR (X-Ray, EUV, Visible, and IR). Free-form Optics design, fabrication, and metrology for CubeSat, SmallSat and Visible Nulling Coronagraph (VNC). A typical Phase I proposal for X-Ray technology would address the relevant optical sub-component of a system with necessary coating and stray light suppression for X-Ray missions or prototype demonstration of a fabricated system and its testing. Similarly, a Coating technology proposal would address fabrication and testing of optical surfaces for a wide range of wavelengths from X-Ray to IR. The Free-form Optics proposals tackle the challenges involved in design, fabrication, and metrology of non-spherical surfaces for small-size missions such as CubeSat, NanoSat, and visible nulling coronagraph. In a nutshell, a successful proposal demonstrates a low-cost ability to address NASAs science mission needs and technical challenges specified under each category of Technical Challenges. Introduction The National Academy Astro2010 Decadal Report identifies studies of optical components and ability to manufacture, coat, and perform metrology needed to enable future X-Ray observatory missions such as Next Generation of X-Ray Observatories (NGXO). The Astrophysics Decadal specifically calls for optical coating technology investment for future UV, Optical, Exoplanet, and IR missions while Heliophysics 2009 Roadmap identifies the coating technology for space missions to enhance rejection of undesirable spectral lines, improve space/solar-flux durability of EUV optical coatings, and coating deposition to increase the maximum spatial resolution. Future optical systems for NASAs low-cost missions, CubeSat and other small-scale payloads, are moving away from traditional spherical optics to non-spherical surfaces with anticipated benefits of freeform optics such as fast wide-field and distortion-free cameras. Technical Challenges X-Ray Optical Component, Systems, and Technologies NASA large X-Ray observatory requires low-cost, ultra-stable, light-weight mirrors with high-reflectance optical coatings and effective stray light suppression. The current state-of-art of mirror fabrication technology for X-Ray missions is very expensive and time consuming. Additionally, a number of improvements such as 10 arc-second angular resolutions and 1 to 5 m2 collecting area are needed for this technology. Likewise, the stray-light suppression system is bulky and ineffective for wide-field of view telescopes. In this area, we are looking to address the multiple technologies including: improvements to manufacturing (machining, rapid optical fabrication, slumping or replication technologies), improved metrology, performance prediction and testing techniques, active control of mirror shapes, new structures for holding and actively aligning of mirrors in a telescope assembly to enable X-Ray observatories while lowering the cost per square meter of collecting aperture and effective design of stray-light suppression in preparation for the Decadal Survey of 2020. Currently, X-Ray space mirrors cost $4 million to $6 million per square meter of optical surface area. This research effort seeks a cost reduction for precision optical components by 5 to 50 times, to less than $1M to $100 K/m2. Coating Technologies for X-Ray, EUV, Visible, and IR Telescopes The optical coating technology is a mission-enabling feature that determines the optical performance and science return of a mission. Lowering the areal cost of coating determines if a proposed mission could be funded in the current cost environment. The current coating technology of optical components needs to achieve TRL-6 by approximately 2018 to support the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal process. A number of optical coating metrics specific each wavelength are desired as: The Optical Coating Metrics X-Ray Metrics: Multilayer high-reflectance coatings for hard X-Ray mirrors similar to NuSTAR. Multilayer depth gradient coatings for 5 to 80 KeV with high broadband reflectivity. Zero-net-stress coating for iridium or other high-reflectance elements on thin substrates (< 0.5 mm). EUV Metrics: Reflectivity > 90% from 6 nm to 200 nm and depositable onto a < 2 meter mirror substrate. UVOIR Metrics: Broadband reflectivity > 60% and uniform polarization from 90 nm to 2500 nm and depositable onto 2, 4, and 6 meter mirror substrates. Non-Stationary Metric: Non- uniform optical coating to be used in both reflection and transmission that vary with location and optical surface. Variation pertains to ratio of reflectivity to transmissivity, optical field amplitude, phase, and polarization change. The optical surface area ranges from1/2 to 6 cm.Scattered Light Suppression Using Carbon Nanotube (CNT) Coating A number of future NASA missions require suppression of scattered light. For instance, the precision optical cube utilized in a beam-splitter application forms a knife-edge that is positioned within the optical system to split a single beam into two halves. The scattered light from the knife-edge could be suppressed by CNT coating. Similarly, the scattered light for gravitational-wave application and lasercom system where the simultaneous transmit/receive operation is required, could be achieved by highly absorbing coating such as CNT. Ideally, the application of CNT coating needs to achieve: Broadband (visible plus Near IR), reflectivity of 0.1% or less Resist bleaching of significant albedo changes over a mission life of ~10 years Withstand launch conditions such vibe, acoustics, etc. Tolerate both high continuous wave (CW) and pulsed power and power densities without damage. ~10 W for CE and ~ 0.1 GW/cm2 density, and 1 kW/nanosecond pulses Adhere to the multi-layer dielectric or protected metal coating including Ion Beam Sputtering (IBS) coating Freeform Optics Design, Fabrication, and Metrology Future NASA missions with alternative low-cost science and small-size payload are constrained by the traditional spherical form of optics. These missions could benefit greatly by the freeform optics as they provide non-spherical optics with better aerodynamic characteristics for spacecraft with lightweight components to meet the mission requirements. Currently, the design and utilization of conformal and freeform shapes are costly due to fabrication and metrology of these parts. Even though various techniques are being investigated to create complex optical surfaces, small-size missions highly desire efficient small packages with lower cost that increase the field of view and expand operational temperature range of un-obscured systems. For the coronagraphic applications, freeform optical components allow coronagraphic nulling without shearing and increase the useful science field of view. In this category, freeform optical prescription for surfaces of 0.5 cm to 6 cm diameters with tolerances of 1 to 2 nm rms are needed. In this respect, the freeform refers to either 2nd order conic prescription with higher order surface polished onto it or without underlying conic prescription with no steps in the surface. The optics with underlying conic prescription would need to be in F/# range of F/2 to F/20. In addition to the freeform fabrication, the metrology of freeform optical components is difficult and challenging due to the large departure from planar or spherical shapes accommodated by conventional interferometric testing. New methods such as multibeam low-coherence optical probe and slope sensitive optical probe are highly desirable. Ultra-Stable X-Ray grazing-incident Telescopes for Sub-Orbital Balloons and Rocket-borne Missions Technology maturation to build complete low-cost, lightweight X-ray telescopes with grazing-incident optics that can be flown on potential long duration high-altitude balloon-borne or rocket-borne missions. The focus here is to reduce the areal cost of telescope by 2x such that the larger collecting area can be produced for the same cost or half the cost. Read less>>"," JPL, MSFC"

We are seeking proposals for the development of innovative technologies to support these future radar and radiometer missions and applications. The areas of interest for this call are listed below. Single Pole Double Throw Switch with the following specifications: Frequency: 183 GHz, 325 GHz, or 380 GHz. Bandwidth: > 15 GHz. Insertion Loss: < 2 dB. Isolation: > 15 dB. Calibration of sub-mm wave radiometers is limited in large part to external sources due to the lack of suitable switches for internal calibration. This increases the mass and cost of these instruments. A SPDT switch at 180 or 340 GHz will significantly reduce the cost and complexity of radiometers at these frequencies. NEW: GaN Schottky diode technology for ultra-high power local oscillator power sources This includes the development of GaN epi-structures on Si or SiC substrates suitable for millimeter-wave operations (SOA electron mobility >1000 cm2/V·s for 5E16 to 1E17 cm-3 epi doping levels, and discrete GaN Schottky diodes (power handling capabilities > 200 mW/diode).

Ka-band (35.5 GHz +/- 100 MHz): Dual Polarization Tx and Rx. Shared beam waist with W-band. Waveguide duplexer and OMT okay. The Decadal Survey ACE mission calls for a dual-frequency (Ka/W-band) radar for observation of clouds and light precipitation from space. Recently a similar but more compact and low cost radar is considered for operation on the International Space Station (ISS). Compared to traditional ferrite material based radar Tx/Rx front-end, quasi-optical front-end offers significantly low loss and high power handling capability, which have direct impact on radar performance. A compact dual-frequency and dual-polarization quasi-optical radar front-end has not been developed and is in critical need for ISS, ACE and suborbital airborne radars. Interconnection technologies to enable highly integrated, low loss distribution networks that integrate power splitters, couplers, filters, and/or isolators in a compact package Technologies are sought that integrate X, Ku, and Ka-bands transmit/receive modules with antenna arrays and/or LO distribution networks for F- and/or G-band receiver arrays.

"TA8 Science Instruments, Observatories & Sensor Systems",TA8.3 Sensor Systems,S1.01Lidar Remote Sensing Technologies, LaRC,"NASA recognizes the potential of lidar technology in meeting many of its science objectives by providing new capabilities or offering enhancements over current measurements of atmospheric and topographic parameters from ground, airborne, and space-based platforms. To meet NASA’s requirements for remote sensing from space, advances are needed in state-of-the-art lidar technology with an emphasis on compactness, efficiency, reliability, lifetime, and high performance. Innovative lidar subsystem and component technologies that directly address the measurement of atmospheric constituents and surface topography of the Earth, Mars, the Moon, and other planetary bodies will be considered under this subtopic. Compact, high-efficiency lidar instruments for deployment on unconventional platforms, such as balloon, small sat, and CubeSat are also considered and encouraged. Proposals must show relevance to the development of lidar instruments that can be used for NASA science-focused measurements or to support current technology programs. Meeting science needs leads to four primary instrument types: Backscatter - Measures beam reflection from aerosols to retrieve the opacity of a gas. Ranging - Measures the return beam’s time-of-flight to retrieve distance. Doppler - Measures wavelength changes in the return beam to retrieve relative velocity. Differential absorption - Measures attenuation of two different return beams (one centered on a spectral line of interest) to retrieve concentration of a trace gas. Phase I research should demonstrate technical feasibility and show a path toward a Phase II prototype unit. Phase II prototypes should be capable of laboratory demonstration and preferably suitable for operation in the field from a ground-based station, an aircraft platform, or any science platform amply defended by the proposer. For the 2016 SBIR Program, NASA is soliciting the component and subsystem technologies described below. Compact and rugged single-frequency continuous-wave and pulsed lasers operating between 0.28-ìm and 2.05-ìm wavelengths suitable for lidar. Specific wavelengths are of interest to match absorption lines or atmospheric transmission: 0.28 to 0.32-ìm (ozone absorption), 0.45 to 0.49-ìm(transmission through ocean water), 0.532-ìm, 0.817 to 0.830-ìm (water lines), 1.0-ìm, 1.57-ìm (CO2 line), 1.65-ìm (methane line), and 2.05-ìm (CO2 line). For wavelengths associated with an absorption line, tunability on the order tens of nanometers is desired. Architectures involving new developments in diode laser, quantum cascade laser, and fiber laser technology are especially encouraged. For pulsed lasers two different regimes of repetition rate and pulse energies are desired: from 8-kHz to 10-kHz with pulse energy greater than 1-mJ and from 20-Hz to 100-Hz with pulse energy greater than 100-mJ. Optical amplifiers for increasing the energy of pulsed lasers in the wavelength range of 0.28-ìm to 2.05-ìm. Specific wavelengths of interest are listed above in the bullet above. Also, amplifier and modulator combinations for converting continuous-wave lasers to a pulsed format are encouraged. Amplifier designs must preserve the wavelength stability and spectral purity of the input laser. Ultra-low noise photoreceiver modules, operating at 1.6-ìm wavelength, consisting of the detection device, complete Dewar/cooling systems, and associated amplifiers. General requirements are: large single-element active detection diameter (>200 micron), high quantum efficiency (>85%), noise equivalent power of the order of 10-14 W/sqrt(Hz), and bandwidth greater than 10 MHz. Novel, highly efficient approaches for High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) receivers. New approaches for high-efficiency measurement of HSRL aerosol properties at 1064, 532 and/or 355-nm. New or improved approaches are sought that substantially increase detection efficiency over current state of the art. Ideally, complete receiver subsystems will be proposed that can be evaluated and/or implemented in instrument concept designs. New space lidar technologies that use small and high-efficiency diode or fiber lasers to measure range and surface reflectance of asteroids and comets from >100 km altitude during mapping to <1 m during landing and sample return at a fraction of the power, mass, and cost of the Mercury Laser Altimeter (i.e., less than 7.4kg, 17W, and 28x28x26cm). The technologies can significantly extend the receiver dynamic range of the current space lidar without movable attenuators, providing sufficient link margin for the longest range but not saturating during landing. The output power of the laser transmitters should be continuously adjusted according to the spacecraft altitude. The receiver should have single photon sensitivity to achieve a near-quantum limited performance for long distance measurement. The receiver integration time can be continuously adjusted to allow trade-off between the maximum range and measurement rate. The lidar should have multiple beams so that it can measure not only the range but also surface slope and orientation. Narrow linewidth and frequency stable laser transmitter at 780-nm wavelength for development of low-cost, compact, and eye-safe high spectral resolution lidar (HSRL) for ground-based profile measurements of aerosol and cloud intensive and extensive properties.

"TA8 Science Instruments, Observatories & Sensor Systems",TA8.3 Sensor Systems,H3.01Environmental Monitoring, JPL,"Environmental Monitoring is comprised of the following four monitoring disciplines: Air, Water, Microbial and acoustics. ISS has employed a wide variety of analytical instruments to deal with critical items. These functional needs are required to address identified risks to crew health during Exploration-class missions. The current approach onboard ISS, if any, will serve as the logical starting point to meeting the functional needs. However, the following limitations were found common to all the current approaches on-board ISS for any missions beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO): reliance on return sample and ground analysis, require too much crew time, constraints on size, mass, and power, lack of portability, and insufficient calibration life. Hence a concerted effort is underway to address these gaps, determine the most promising solutions, and mature those solutions to ground and flight technology demonstrations. Technologies that show improvements in miniaturization, reliability, life-time, self-calibration, and reduction of expendables are of interest. Methods for collection and concentration for microbial surface monitoring NASA continues to invest in the near- and mid-term development of highly-desirable systems and technologies that provide innovative ways to monitor microbial burden and enable to meet required cleanliness level of the closed habitat. To date, systematic microbial monitoring of ISS is carried out for water and not for environmental surfaces or air. The sample collection and subsequent processing for either culturing or molecular methods require sample concentration. Presently, swabs are used to collect 25 cm2 area before processing and often times this outdated technique is fraught with decreased sensitivity in removing biological materials from the surface. NASA is interested in an integrated sample collection/concentration/extraction system that could feed samples to conventional or molecular microbial monitoring techniques. Furthermore, integration of these steps and a sample delivery to the molecular instruments (such as PCR) as a single module is solicited. Required technology characteristics include a 2 year shelf-life and functionality in microgravity and low pressure environment (~8 psi). The proposed integrated sample collection/concentration/extraction delivery system for molecular microbial monitoring detection should be capable of collecting and concentrating all kinds of microorganisms including “problematic” microbial species on-board ISS (ISS MORD: SSP 50260; (http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf(link is external))). Ethylene analyzer Ethylene gas is a natural metabolite in plants and acts as a plant hormone. In closed settings, such as plant (food) production chambers, ethylene can build up to deleterious levels for the plants. NASA needs innovative concepts for monitoring ethylene on a real time or near real time basis. Detection limits should ideally be near 25 ppb to insure effective management of plant growth systems, both for fundamental space research and for using plants in bioregenerative life support applications. Calcium, conductivity and pH monitors for urine and wastewater A rugged calcium sensor is needed to optimize the percentage of the recovery from brine. The calcium sensor would allow engineers to process a urine batch by knowing precisely the actual calcium concentration, enabling the urine processor to approach the solubility limit of calcium species. The calcium sensor would need to be able to measure calcium at levels of 50-400 mg/L in urine that has been pretreated to a pH of 0.5-3.0. The sensor should be rugged and not require frequent calibration or replacement and should be accurate to within 10%. Rugged conductivity and pH sensors that monitor the conductivity and pH in the brine loop would allow brine to be processed more thoroughly to recover more water. As the brine becomes more concentrated during urine processing, the measurement of conductivity and pH would allow the processor to recover water just to the point of solids precipitation. The conductivity sensor should be able to measure conductivity from 10-250 mS/cm in a urine brine that has a pH of 0.5-5.0. Likewise the pH sensor should be able to measure pH from 0.5-5.0 in a urine brine that has the conductivity of 10-250 mS/cm.

Diagnostics developed will be tested in NASA’s high enthalpy facilities, which include the Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST), Arc Jets, Ballistic Range, Hypersonic Materials Environmental Test System (HyMETS), and 8’ High Temperature Tunnel (HTT). Development of improved diagnostics for hypervelocity flows allows us to better understand the composition and thermochemsitry of our ground test facilities and are important for building ground-to-flight traceability. Characterizations in facilities may be used to validate and/or calibrate predictive modeling tools which are used to design and margin EDL requirements. This will reduce uncertainty in future mission planning. Diagnostics of interest include measurement of temperature, velocity, electron number density, and information regarding byproducts of pyrolysis and ablation in CO2 or air environments. Due to variation in facility operations, the diagnostics are required to obtain reasonable signals in test times down to approximately 4 μs with resolution on sub-μs time scales.

The ablative TPS materials currently in development include felt or woven material precursors impregnated with polymers and/or additives to improve ablation and insulative performance, along with the block form of Avcoat ablator for MPCV. Two classes of materials are currently in development for planetary aerocapture and entry. The first class is for a rigid mid L/D (lift to drag ratio) shaped vehicle with requirements to survive a dual heating exposure, with the first at heat fluxes of 400-500 W/cm2 (primarily convective) and integrated heat loads of up to 55 kJ/cm2, and the second at heat fluxes of 100-200 W/cm2 and integrated heat loads of up to 25 kJ/cm2. These materials or material systems are likely dual layer in nature, either bonded or integrally manufactured. The second class is for a deployable aerodynamic decelerator, required to survive a single or dual heating exposure, with the first (or single) pulse at heat fluxes of 50-150 W/cm2 (primarily convective) and integrated heat loads of 10 kJ/cm2, and the second pulse at heat fluxes of 30-50 W/cm2 and heat loads of 5 kJ/cm2. These materials are either flexible or deployable. Also currently in development is a third class of materials, for higher velocity (>11.5 km/s) Earth return, with requirements to survive heat fluxes of 1500-2500 W/cm2, with radiation contributing up to 75% of that flux, and integrated heat loads from 75-150 kJ/cm2. These materials are currently based upon 3-D woven architectures. Technologies sought are: The development of a high char yield, flexible polymer with high strain-to-failure for used in bonding and/or gap fills for tiles of advanced TPS for extreme entry conditions. While high char yield (comparable to phenolic) and high strain-to-failure (>1%) are key requirements, additional goals would include some or all of the following: high decomposition temperatures (comparable to phenolic or higher); room temperature cure preferred; manufactured in air (inert environment not required); stable at ambient conditions (not overly sensitive to moisture in cured or un-cured state); compatible with cured epoxy, phenolic, and/or cynate ester, extended out-time; and very low glass transition temperature to retain flexibility in space. Development of in-situ sensor systems including pressure sensors, heat flux sensors, surface recession diagnostics, and in-depth or structural interface thermal response measurement devices, for use on rigid and/or flexible ablative materials. Individual sensors can be proposed; however, instrumentation systems that include power, signal conditioning and data collection electronics are of particular interest. In-situ heat flux sensors and surface recession diagnostics tools are needed for flight systems to provide better traceability from the modeling and design tools to actual performance. The resultant data can lead to higher fidelity design tools, improved risk quantification, decreased heat shield mass, and increases in direct payload. The pressure sensors should be accurate to 0.5%, heat flux sensors should be accurate within 20%, surface recession diagnostic sensors should be accurate within 10%, and any temperature sensors should be accurate within 5% of actual values. These should require minimum mass, power, volume, and cost; MEMS-based, wireless, optical, acoustic, ultrasonic, and other minimally-intrusive methods are possible examples. All proposed systems should utilize low-cost, modular electronics that handle both digital and analog sensor inputs and could readily be qualified for the space environments of interest. Typical sensor frequencies are 1-10 Hz, with up to 200 channels of collected data. Consideration should be given to those sensors that will be applicable to multiple material systems. Advances are sought in ablation modeling, including radiation, convection, gas surface interactions, pyrolysis, coking, and charring for low and mid-density fiber based (woven or felt) ablative materials. There is a specific need for improved models for low- and mid-density as well as multi-layered charring ablators (with different chemical composition in each layer). The modeling efforts should include consideration of the non-equilibrium states of the pyrolysis gases and the surface thermochemistry, as well as the potential to couple the resulting models to a computational fluid dynamics solver. Advances are sought in modeling mechanical properties of 3-D woven materials. Tools that analyze and predict the effects of different fibers on the warp and fill directional properties that could help in fiber selection and weave design are sought.

Sensing technologies are desired that determine any number of the following: Terrain relative translational state (altimetry/3-axis velocimetry). Spacecraft absolute state in planetary/small-body frame (either attitude, translation, or both). Terrain point cloud (for hazard detection, absolute state estimation, landing/sampling site selection, and/or body shape characterization).

NASA also seeks to use measurements made during EDL to better characterize the atmosphere of planetary bodies, providing data for improving atmospheric modeling for future landers or ascent vehicles. Successful candidate sensor technologies can address this call by: Extending the dynamic range over which such measurements are collected (e.g., providing a single surface topology sensor that works over a large altitude range such as 1m to >10km, and high attitude rates such as greater than 45° /sec). Improving the state-of-the-art in measurement accuracy/precision/resolution for the above sensor needs.

Significantly reducing the impact of incorporating such sensors on the spacecraft in terms of Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP), spacecraft accomodation complexity, and/or cost. Providing sensors that are robust to environmental dust/sand/illumination effects. Mitigation technologies for dust/particle contamination of optical surfaces such as sensor optics, with possible extensibility to solar panels and thermal surfaces for Lunar, asteroid, and comet missions. For all the aforementioned technologies, candidate solutions are sought that can be made compatible with the environmental conditions of deep spaceflight, the rigors of landing on planetary bodies both with and without atmospheres, and planetary protection requirements. NASA is also looking for high-fidelity real-time simulation and stimulation of passive and active optical sensors for computer vision at update rates greater than 2 Hz to be used for signal injection in terrestrial spacecraft system test beds. These solutions are to be focused on improving system-level performance Verification and Validation during spacecraft assembly and test. NASA also seeks low-mass (on the order of the density of the fabric itself), fabric-and/or-fiber-embedded sensors and time-synchronized, distributed data collection systems (preferably less than 30 grams total) to measure the time history of load/stress/strain distributed across large (30+ meters), trailing-body deployable decelerator technologies such as parachutes and ballutes. The distributed sensors and data collection systems must be self-powered and capable of being pressure-packed into a compressed mortar canister installation package and stored for up to 1 year or more. All sensors and data collection packages in the distributed system are to record time-stamped peak sensor values and time histories, with time-stamp accuracies not to exceed 4 milliseconds relative to a central vehicle data collection system using IRIG and GPS technology for time-stamping and synchronization. Packages must survive the parachute deployment and inflation events and if data is stored locally on the individual devices, survive recovery from the ocean after many hours of immersion in seawater.

"TA11 Modeling, Simulation, Information Technology and Processing",TA11.1 Computing,S5.01Technologies for Large-Scale Numerical Simulation, ARC,"NASA scientists and engineers are increasingly turning to large-scale numerical simulation on supercomputers to advance understanding of complex Earth and astrophysical systems, and to conduct high-fidelity aerospace engineering analyses. The goal of this subtopic is to increase the mission impact of NASA's investments in supercomputing systems and associated operations and services. Specific objectives are to: Decrease the barriers to entry for prospective supercomputing users. Minimize the supercomputer user's total time-to-solution (e.g., time to discover, understand, predict, or design). Increase the achievable scale and complexity of computational analysis, data ingest, and data communications. Reduce the cost of providing a given level of supercomputing performance on NASA applications. Enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of NASA's supercomputing operations and services. Expected outcomes are to improve the productivity of NASA's supercomputing users, broaden NASA's supercomputing user base, accelerate advancement of NASA science and engineering, and benefit the supercomputing community through dissemination of operational best practices. The approach of this subtopic is to seek novel software and hardware technologies that provide notable benefits to NASA's supercomputing users and facilities, and to infuse these technologies into NASA supercomputing operations. Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, NASA's high-end computing (HEC) projects - the High End Computing Capability project at Ames and the Scientific Computing project at Goddard. To assure maximum relevance to NASA, funded SBIR contracts under this subtopic should engage in direct interactions with one or both HEC projects, and with key HEC users where appropriate. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and NASA relevance during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration. Offerors should demonstrate awareness of the state-of-the-art of their proposed technology, and should leverage existing commercial capabilities and research efforts where appropriate. Open source software and open standards are strongly preferred. Note that the NASA supercomputing environment is characterized by: HEC systems operating behind a firewall to meet strict IT security requirements. Communication-intensive applications. Massive computations requiring high concurrency. Complex computational workflows and immense datasets. The need to support hundreds of complex application codes - many of which are frequently updated by the user/developer. As a result, solutions that involve the following must clearly explain how they would work in the NASA environment: Technologies involving elements operating outside of the NASA supercomputing firewall. Embarrassingly parallel computations. Technologies that require significant application re-engineering. Projects need not benefit all NASA HEC users or application codes, but demonstrating applicability to an important NASA discipline, or even a key NASA application code, could provide significant value. Specific technology areas of interest: Efficient Computing - In spite of the rapidly increasing capability and efficiency of supercomputers, NASA's HEC facilities cannot purchase, power, and cool sufficient HEC resources to satisfy all user demands. This subtopic element seeks dramatically more efficient and effective supercomputing approaches in terms of their ability to supply increased HEC capability or capacity per dollar and/or per Watt for real NASA applications. Examples include: novel computational accelerators and architectures; cloud supercomputing with high performance interconnects (e.g., InfiniBand); enhanced visualization technologies; improved algorithms for key codes; power-aware ""Green"" computing technologies and techniques; and approaches to effectively manage and utilize many-core processors including algorithmic changes, compiler techniques and runtime systems. ​User Productivity Environments - The user interface to a supercomputer is typically a command line in a text window. This subtopic element seeks more intuitive, intelligent, user-customizable, and integrated interfaces to supercomputing resources, enabling users to more completely leverage the power of HEC to increase their productivity. Such an interface could enhance many essential supercomputing tasks: accessing and managing resources, training, getting services, developing and porting codes (e.g., debugging and performance analysis), running computations, managing files and data, analyzing and visualizing results, transmitting data, collaborating, etc. Ultra-Scale Computing - Over the next decade, the HEC community faces great challenges in enabling its users to effectively exploit next-generation supercomputers featuring massive concurrency to the tune of millions of cores. To overcome these challenges, this subtopic element seeks ultra-scale computing technologies that enable resiliency/fault-tolerance in extreme-scale (unreliable) systems both at job startup and during execution. Also of interest are system and software co-design methodologies, to achieve performance and efficiency synergies. Finally, tools are sought that facilitate verification and validation of ultra-scale applications and systems. Read less>>", GSFC

"TA11 Modeling, Simulation, Information Technology and Processing",TA11.2 Modeling,A1.05Physics-Based Computational Tools - Stability and Control/High Lift Design Tools, LaRC,"NASA continues to investigate the potential of advanced, innovative propulsion and airframe concepts to improve fuel efficiency and reduce the environmental footprint of future generations of commercial transports across the breadth of the flight speed regimes. Advanced concepts are viewed as potential options for helping to meet aggressive, long range (i.e., 'N+3' timeframe) fuel burn, noise, and emission reduction targets. Conceptual design and analysis of unconventional airframe and propulsion concepts and technologies is used within NASA for technology portfolio investment planning, development of advanced concepts to provide technology pull, and independent technical assessment of new concepts, so the agency's systems analysts need the best conceptual design and analysis tools possible to support these efforts. Historically, only empirical and semi-empirical analysis methods have been used during the conceptual design phase. These techniques work well for the conceptual design of conventional systems with parameters that reside within the historical databases used to develop the methodologies. However, these methods are not well suited for unconventional concepts, or even conventional concepts which reside outside of the database. Substantial progress has been made recently in incorporating more physics-based analysis tools in the conceptual design process, and NASA has developed a capability that integrates several analysis tools and models in engineering frameworks, such as ModelCenter and OpenMDAO, with a geometry-centric approach built around tools such as OpenVSP and GeoMACH. However, modeling gaps still remain in many disciplines. Developing higher-order, more-accurate tools suitable for conceptual design is a difficult challenge. To perform the configuration trades and optimization typical in conceptual design, runtimes measured in seconds or minutes, instead of hours or days, are required. Additionally, because it is not possible to model every detail of the design and account for all the underlying physics in the problem formulation, it is difficult to predict the 'as-built' characteristics with physics-based methods alone. Finally, the gap between the analysis capability and the maturity of the design being analyzed currently limits the usefulness of high order analysis in conceptual design. Physics-based tools for conceptual design are needed which can rapidly and accurately predict the as-built characteristics of unconventional aircraft designs, while remaining consistent with the amount of design knowledge that is available at the conceptual design stage. Sizing of an aircraft design can be strongly affected by its takeoff and landing characteristics, yet for both conventional and unconventional aircraft concepts it can be difficult to accurately estimate the aerodynamic performance in the high-lift configuration. In addition, many traditional methods of sizing aircraft controls surfaces and assuring acceptable handling qualities have lost their validity as more unconventional aircraft are being studied, and additional dynamic modes might become unstable. For FY2016, specific capabilities are being sought in the following areas: Methods for aerodynamic analysis, weight estimation, and design of aircraft high-lift systems. Analysis of the aerodynamic performance of externally-blown flaps. Robust prediction of maximum lift coefficient with flaps and slats extended. Estimation of high-lift system weight as a function of design parameters. Optimization of high-lift component design, trading aerodynamic performance and weight/complexity to minimize overall aircraft system weight, fuel burn and cost as an objective function. Methods for analysis of aircraft static and dynamic stability characteristics suitable for unconventional aircraft. Physics-based sizing of tails and control surfaces that is more sensitive to aircraft design parameters than traditional tail volume coefficients. Calculation of mass moments of inertia for the complete aircraft system throughout the full mission. Simulation of the dynamics of unconventional aircraft configurations with tight coupling of propulsion and aerodynamics characteristics, including evaluation of active control systems. Definition of handling qualities for unmanned aerial systems. The desired capabilities are physics-based methods that are of higher order than traditional empirical methods, but can be applied in the conceptual design phase with limited requirements on the availability of detailed design information. Newly-developed methods and methods integration activities should include verification and validation of results, and will ideally address quantification of uncertainty and calculation of sensitivity derivatives for use in adjoint design.

To operate within highly distributed, collaborative design environments, where models and/or infrastructure that support/encourage designers are geographically separated (including Open Innovation environments). This includes considerations associated with near-real-time (concurrent?) collaboration processes and associated model integration and configuration management practices.

One area of interest is new decision support tools and systems for a variety of ecological applications such as managing coastal environments, natural resources or responding to natural disasters. Currently, creating decision support tools (DST) that effectively utilize remote sensing data requires significant efforts by experts in multiple domains. This creates a barrier to the widespread use of Earth observations by state and local governments, businesses, and the public. This subtopic aims to democratize the creation of Earth science driven decision support tools and to unleash a creative explosion of DST development that significantly increases the return on investment for Earth science missions.

Multifunctional materials and structural systems will provide reductions in mass and volume for next generation vehicles. The NASA Technology Roadmap TA12, “Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems, and Manufacturing” (http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/2015_nasa_technology_roadmaps_ta_12_materials_structures_final.pdf), proposed Multifunctional Structures as one of their top 5 technical challenges, and the NRC review of the roadmap recommended it as the top priority in this area stating: “… To the extent that a structure can simultaneously perform additional functions, mission capability can be increased with decreased mass. Such multifunctional materials and structures will require new design analysis tools and might exhibit new failure modes; these should be understood for use in systems design and space systems operations.” Some functional capabilities beyond structural that are in this multifunctional theme are insulating (thermal, acoustic, etc.), inflatable, protective (radiation and micrometeoroids and orbital debris), sensing, healing, in-situ inspectable (e.g., IVHM), actuating, integral cooling/heating, power generating (thermal-electric, photovoltaic, etc.), and so on. Because of the broad scope possible in this SBIR subtopic, the intent is to vary its focus each year to address specific areas of multi-functionality: That have high payoff for a specific mission. That are broadly applicable to many missions. That could find broader applications outside of NASA which would allow for partnerships to leverage the development of these technologies. For FY16, this SBIR subtopic seeks innovative, multifunctional approaches to integrating long-duration health monitoring capabilities within the range of candidate materials currently being investigated for space habitat long-duration mission concepts. These materials include, but are not limited to, thin-ply composites as well as the materials comprising the multiple soft-goods layers utilized in expandable space habitats, including the bladder, restraint and MMOD layers. Soft-goods materials, used in expandable habitats, may be packaged in an unloaded state for long periods of time prior to deployment, and then maintained at pressure for several years during a mission, while also being subjected to varying levels of thermal cycling. This creates a challenging set of conditions from which to predict the mechanical behavior of these structures over their operational life. NASA seeks the integration of robust, long-term sensing capabilities into the flexible materials (e.g., webbing, cordage, and woven fabrics) used in long-duration habitats, to provide health monitoring and evaluation of the structural integrity and properties of the multi-layer habitat structure throughout its mission life. The integration of the sensors would ideally be performed directly during manufacture; however, robust integration, post-fabrication, via non-destructive application, is also of interest. Ideally, the innovative sensing technology and integration approach should maintain the load-carrying capability or some other structural design requirement, and those technologies that enable weight reduction with similar or better structural performance when compared to traditional approaches will be considered. Sensing capabilities can include both the direct measurement of properties (strain, displacement, and load for example) and sensor fusion using multiple sensors to predict and locate critical damage areas and probable failure zones. The goal for long-duration space habitat design is fail-safe operation; providing monitoring and early prediction of failure onset via structural health monitoring and a benign, progressive failure architecture that allows for safe evacuation even at or after the first failure point. In summary NASA seeks innovations in integrating structural health monitoring into materials for long-duration deep space habitats, including, but not limited to, state-of-the art thin-ply composites and soft-goods materials for expandable habitat structural concepts, during or after fabrication, to enable evaluation of structural properties and failure prediction over the duration of the habitat’s operational life. Contractors should prove the feasibility of proposed innovations using suitable analyses and small scale tests in Phase I. In Phase II, significant testing/fabrication or software capabilities should be developed and demonstrated. A Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at the end of Phase II of 3-4 or higher is desired.

Square solar sails typically consist of four reflective triangular membranes supported by lightweight deployable booms, as well as mechanical sail actuation to assist attitude control. Specific innovations sought for 6U cubesat solar sails in this solicitation are: improved deployable boom technologies, novel sail designs and packaging concepts, and simpler or more-effective mechanical attitude control systems. Proposed improvements to the booms used on the LightSail mission (metallic Triangular Rollable and Collapsible (TRAC) booms) are of special interest. Nominal solar sail requirements for 6U cubesats are: Deployed reflective surface area > 85 m2 (>100 m2 preferred). Stowed membrane volume < 10 cm x 10 cm x 20 cm. Sail membrane stress > 70 kPa. Minimum system deployed natural frequency > 0.1 Hz. Mission life > 3 years in deep space (< 2 AU from the Sun) including lunar vicinity. Deployed sail surface as flat as possible considering all thermal and mechanical loads and residual stresses. Improvements to the deployable TRAC booms proposed for the NEA Scout solar sail should meet the following additional requirements: Deployed boom length: > 8 m (up to 10 m preferred). Stowed volume for all booms and deployment mechanisms < 5 cm x 10 cm x 20 cm. Boom buckling load > 3N. Mass of each boom < 0.25 kg (< 0.15 kg preferred). Capability #2: Deployable Solar Arrays Smallsats promise cost-effective solutions for diverse human spaceflight precursor missions using fuel-efficient solar electric propulsion (SEP). SEP thrust increases with electrical power, so larger solar arrays can shorten travel times and allow higher-power science and communications equipment. This subtopic seeks structures innovations for the next generation of smallsat solar arrays with at least 5x larger area than basic body-mounted solar cells or hinged pop-out panels. Scaling up electrical power for smallsats by > 5x will require game changing innovations. In particular, novel flexible-substrate solar array designs are sought that minimize structural mass and packaging volume while maximizing deployment reliability and deployed area, stiffness, strength, and longevity. Nominal solar array requirements are: Beginning-of-life (BOL) power at 1 AU > 200 W for cubesats or > 600 W for microsats. Packaging efficiency > 50 kW/m3 BOL. Recurring cost < $500/W. Deployment reliability > 0.999. Deployed stiffness > 0.5 Hz. Deployed strength > 0.05 g (all directions). Lifetime > 2 yrs. Proposals should emphasize structural design innovations, not materials or photovoltaic innovations. Solar array designs that can be rapidly commercialized are of special interest. For both capabilities, contractors should prove the feasibility of proposed innovations with suitable analyses and tests in Phase I. Significant hardware or software capabilities should be developed and demonstrated in Phase II. A Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at the end of Phase II of 3-4 or higher is desired.

"TA12 Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems and Manufacturing",TA12.2 Structures,H5.04In-Space Structural Assembly, LaRC,"In-space assembly (ISA) of spacecraft systems has been proposed and demonstrated several times as way of assembling systems too large to fit into a single launch vehicle and enabling installation of orbital replacement units. The International Space Station and the repair missions of the Hubble Space Telescope are two good examples. Efficient structural assembly in space, namely structures with low-mass and high-stiffness and strength, can be achieved by system level design that takes advantage of robotic assembly. For deep-space exploration, the key technology gaps for a robust ISA capability are the joining and unjoining technology (mechanical and electrical), design modularity, and the reuse of components. These technologies will enable a capability that makes future long duration vehicle systems more affordable than the current single-launch, single-use approach to space vehicle design. The need for on-orbit repair/assembly/servicing are well documented Ref. 1-3. This subtopic seeks in-space assembly and structures manufacturing innovations in two areas of special interest for proposed deep-space space exploration missions: Reversible joining technology for structural components and modules.In-space and surface systems that recycle spent metallic and composite components to produce additive manufacturing feedstock. Design solutions must minimize mass, power, and complexity while meeting all other mission requirements including contamination control, load bearing strength and stiffness of the assemblage. Capability #1: Reversible Joining Technology The ability to join structural and spacecraft components in-space allows for the assembly of vehicles (perhaps aggregated from multiple launches) and for re-use of vehicle subsystems. The joining technology should be reversible for maximum flexibility and utilize simple approaches (electro-mechanical or other) amenable to robotic assembly and disassembly. In addition, the joining technology must provide for mechanical, electrical and optionally thermal load transfer. This subtopic capability seeks innovative joining technologies and capabilities for in-space assembly, disassembly, and re-use of deep-space exploration vehicle subsystems such as cargo tugs that use solar electric power for propulsion. Joining in-space of structural trusses that support multiple solar arrays for solar electric propulsion is one class of needed joining technology. The assembled truss must provide power connections either integral to the structural joint or as a non-mechanical load bearing harness with connectors. The second class of in-space joining is for modular subsystems nominally three-dimensional shapes (square or rectangular) with power, data, and mechanical load carrying connections. While these modules could represent orbital replacement units (ORUs), the modules could serve to construct an entire space vehicle. In particular, novel reversible joining systems for robotic operations are needed that minimize mass, energy and complexity while maximizing assembled stiffness, strength and stability. Nominal joining applications are: Class 1: Structural Truss Joints. Strength: > 0.4 g (Mars Extensible) in all degrees of freedom assuming a fixed joint with 1 meter rigid offset of a 100Kg point mass. Power Transmission: > 5 kW. Operating Temperature: -100° C to +100° C. Assembly/Disassembly: > 20 times. Class 2: Module Joints. Strength: > 0.4 g (Mars Extensible) with 0.25 meter cubic module connected on one face with uniform density of 640 Kg/m3. Power Transmission: > 5 kW. Data Transmission: 25 low voltage lines. Temperature: -100° C to +100° C. Assembly/Disassembly: > 20 times. In Phase I, contractors should prove the feasibility of proposed innovations using suitable analyses and prototype tests. In Phase II, operational joining hardware for assembly and disassembly. Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at the end of Phase II is expected to be 3-4 or higher. Capability #2: In-situ Surface Manufacturing Sustainable extraterrestrial presence will require innovative approaches to lightweighting launch masses. The ability to manufacture structures onsite affords an alternative to carrying components of surface systems as part of the launch mass and volume. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers the flexibility to achieve this objective since it enables the conversion of various feedstocks into functional components, especially. Maximum benefits can be realized if the AM method can take advantage of resources available onsite, including both ISRU extracted planetary metals and discarded materials. State of the art AM techniques can process material classes ranging from metals to plastics and ceramics. Typically, AM equipment use pristine forms of these material feedstocks. This manufacturing capability will permit the construction of various surface systems using feedstock carried as part of the launch and taking advantage of AM in this manner can contribute to the reduction of volume required to carry partly or fully assembled surface systems during launch. However, the impact of AM can be maximized if it is also able to utilize a broader suite of materials, especially those generated from repurposing objects/components required only for launch and transport to the exploration destination, in-space and surface presence. For example, metallic or composite parts from vehicles needed only for transit to the planetary surface, can be recycled to construct pressure vessels for life support and propulsion. The ability to repurpose what would otherwise be discarded materials and/or fabricate with processed extracted planetary materials (such as iron, aluminum, and silicon) takes full advantage of limited resources available to make sustained presence affordable. Further, automated AM offers a means to construct surface systems ahead of the arrival of humans. Proposals are sought for additive manufacturing concepts that can enable manufacturing from extracted planetary materials and/or the recycling/repurposing of structural components from space vehicles to produce pressure vessels. This does not include the process of ISRU to extract the materials, just the use of the extracted materials in AM. (See H1.01 In-Situ Resource Utilization for processes to extract materials.) Of interest are the following: Design concepts for AM approaches to accommodate feedstocks that are composites of various material types including but not limited to: Processing techniques to recycle and repurpose structural composites having thermoset matrices and carbon fiber reinforcement to yield AM feedstocks. Processing techniques to recycle and repurpose structural metallic vehicle components to yield AM feedstocks. Approaches to join additively manufactured components from disparate materials. Approaches to use minimal power in the manufacture of components. Mobile AM methods that operate on power generated from planetary surface resources. Nominal manufacturing applications are: Class 1: Pressure vessels. Size: > 0.25 m3. Strength: > 14.7 psi. Operating Temperature: -100° C to +100° C. Class 2: Two-Dimensional Platform for Mobile Carrier. Size: > 3 meter X 2 meter with thickness based on strength. Strength: > 0.4 g (Mars) with 300 Kg mass uniformly distributed. Operating Temperature: -100° C to +100° C. In Phase I, contractors should prove the feasibility of proposed innovations using suitable analyses and prototype tests. In Phase II, prototype manufacturing systems capable of processing multiple material classes. Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at the end of Phase II is expected to be 3-4 or higher.

TA13 Ground and Launch Systems Processing,TA13.3 Technologies to Increase Reliability and Mission Availability,H10.02Advanced Propulsion Systems Ground Test Technology, SSC,"Rocket propulsion development is enabled by rigorous ground testing in order to mitigate the propulsion system risks that are inherent in spaceflight. This is true for virtually all propulsive devices of a space vehicle including liquid and solid rocket propulsion, chemical and non-chemical propulsion, boost stage and in-space propulsion and so forth. It involves a combination of component-level and engine-level testing to demonstrate the propulsion devices were designed to meet the specified requirements for a specified operational envelope and over robust margins and shown to be sufficiently reliable, prior to its first flight.

The goal is to advanced propulsion ground test technologies to enhance environment simulation, minimize test program time, cost and risk and meet existing environmental and safety regulations. It is focused on near-term products that augment and enhance proven, state-of-the-art propulsion test facilities. In particular, technology needs includes producing large quantities of hot hydrogen, and develop robust materials, advanced instruments and monitoring systems capable of operating in extreme temperature and harsh environments. This subtopic seeks innovative technologies in the following areas: Efficient generation of high temperature (>2500°R), high flowrate (<60 lb/sec) hydrogen. Devices for measurement of pressure, temperature, strain and radiation in a high temperature and/or harsh environment. Development of innovative rocket test facility components (e.g., valves, flowmeters, actuators, tanks, etc.) for ultra-high pressure (>8000 psi), high flow rate (>100 lbm/sec) and cryogenic environments. Robust and reliable component designs which are oxygen compatible and can operate efficiency in high vibro-acoustic, environments. Advanced materials to resist high-temperature (<4400° F), hydrogen embrittlement and harsh environments. Tools using computational methods to accurately model and predict system performance are required that integrate simple interfaces with detailed design and/or analysis software. SSC is interested in improving capabilities and methods to accurately predict and model the transient fluid structure interaction between cryogenic fluids and immersed components to predict the dynamic loads, frequency response of facilities. Improved capabilities to predict and model the behavior of components (valves, check valves, chokes, etc.) during the facility design process are needed. This capability is required for modeling components in high pressure (to 12,000 psi), with flow rates up to several thousand lb/sec, in cryogenic environments and must address two-phase flows.

TA13 Ground and Launch Systems Processing,TA13.3 Technologies to Increase Reliability and Mission Availability,H10.01Improved Test and Launch Operations via Interface Design, KSC,"This subtopic seeks to improve ground and surface processing in both the operational and test environments through improved interface design concepts. A substantial portion of pre-launch processing involves the integration of spacecraft assemblies to each other or to the ground/surface systems that supply the commodities, power or data. Each assembly requires an interface that connects it to the adjacent hardware which includes flight critical seals or connectors and other components. The impact of these interface-driven tasks are of particular concern for surface systems where the additional work must be accomplished by crew performing Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs) or by purpose-built robotic systems. The interfaces between payloads, boosters and ground/surface support equipment have historically been drivers of numerous delays and unplanned work prior to launch. The developmental impact of interface design and requirements development includes extensive design labor and validation for any new integrated launch system. Finally, the historical trend of having unique interface types for different launch systems has hampered recent efforts to establish a multi-user capability for existing launch infrastructure. Development and adoption of improved, standardized interfaces holds the potential of reducing the cost and complexity of future space systems and their related design and implementation, which can increase the funding available for flight hardware and drive down the cost of government and commercial access to space. Standardization of interfaces used during testing or launch processing also provides eventual benefits to autonomous servicing, a key space technology for future missions. Future in-space and surface servicing of multiple spacecraft/user types such as satellites becomes more feasible if a common interface approach can be developed and widely adopted. Technologies sought for interface design are grouped in the following two focus areas: Physical Interfaces Modular architectures of expandable surface systems that minimize the adverse impact of interface connections. Interfaces suitable for modular, reliable, cryogenic propellant liquefaction architectures that enable incremental system approaches for increasing capacities as needed. Dust-tolerant interface approaches that drive highly reliable and/or autonomous connections. Development of earth based analog test hardware to test and validate these surface system interface concepts (module equipment interfaces and/or surface to vehicle interfaces). Connector technologies including ports, disconnects or couplers that enable standardization across the industry for the transfer of cryogenic and storable propellants or other servicing fluids, power, and/or data for Governmental and Commercial launch providers and/or future surface system analog testing. Interface concepts that simplify or standardize future Interface Requirements Documents (IRDs) or enable increased use of off-the-shelf hardware for future flight and exploration support systems. Solutions that promote standardization of key payload to launch vehicle and subsystem interface standards to reduce the cost associated with analysis, design, configure, integration, and preparation of space systems for launch and reusability through standard servicing interfaces. Novel concepts for adaptation of common interface architectures from relevant industries and the analysis and development required to adapt them to space and exploration architectures. Adaptation should include providing the relevant certification planning required for acceptance by government and industry. Software/Data Interfaces Concepts for embedded intelligence within interfaces that include software attributes to enhance the usage of interface data for tasks such as self-testing, diagnostics, configuration verification and/or management of the interface. Concepts for the use of industry standards and/or open source software to reduce or eliminate the need for dedicated interfaces by more efficiently managing system configurations. Software addressable interfaces conducting fault isolation and recovery, and decrease of software integration costs. Interface concepts that simplify or standardize future Interface Requirements Documents (IRDs) or enable increased use of off-the-shelf hardware for future flight and exploration support systems.

TA14 Thermal Management Systems,TA14.2 Thermal Control Systems,S3.07Thermal Control Systems, GSFC,"Future Spacecraft and instruments for NASA's Science Mission Directorate will require increasingly sophisticated thermal control technology. Innovative proposals for the cross-cutting thermal control discipline are sought in the following areas: Components of advanced small spacecraft such as CubeSat/SmallSat will have very small masses (i.e., small thermal capacitance), and their temperatures are highly sensitive to variations in the component power output and spacecraft environmental temperature. Advanced thermal devices capable of maintaining components within their specified temperature ranges are needed. Some examples are: Phase change systems with high thermal capacity and minimal structural mass. High performance, low cost insulation systems for diverse environments. High flux heat acquisition and transport devices; d) thermal coatings with low absorptance, high emmittance, and good electrical conductivity; and e) a miniature pumped fluid loop system that is lightweight, provides radiator turndown, and consumes minimal power (< 2W). Current capillary heat transfer devices require tedious processes to insert the porous wick into the evaporator and to seal the wick ends for liquid and vapor separation. Advanced technology such as additive manufacturing is needed to simplify the processes and ensure good sealing at both ends of the wick, especially for miniature thermal systems for CubeSat/SmallSat applications. Additive manufacturing technology can also be used to produce integrated heat exchangers for pumped fluid loops in order to increase heat transfer performance while significantly reducing mass, labor and cost. Science missions are more dependent on optically sensitive instruments and systems, and effects of thermal distortion on the performance of the system are critical. Current Structural-Thermal-Optical (STOP) analysis has several codes that do some form of integrated analysis, but none that have the capability to analyze any optical system and do a full end-to-end analysis. An improvement of existing code is needed in order to yield software that can integrate with all commonly used programs at NASA for mechanical, structural, thermal and optical analysis. The software should be user-friendly, and allow full STOP analysis for performance predictions based on mechanical design, and structural/thermal material properties. Missions with high sink temperatures require temperature lifting devices in order to dissipate the heat. Some advanced devices having long life, high efficiency are sought for, including absorption/adsorption systems, advanced TECs, etc. The use of heat lift devices can also reduce the radiator area, hence realizing mass and volume savings. Current analysis for ablation analysis of re-entry vehicles utilizes various computer codes for predicting the following individual phenomena: aeroheating, ablation, thermal response behind the bond line, thermal radiation, and structural response to thermal and pressure environments. The interfaces between each code lead to potential errors, inaccuracy, and huge computer run time. What is needed is a single code that evaluates the trajectory or input conditions, predicts aeroheating over the surface, does an integrated ablation-thermal analysis, and then uses that thermal and pressure gradient to do a full structural analysis. Even better would be a link back to the aeroheating prediction code to revise the aeroheating based on shape change from structural analysis and ablation. New techniques for measuring the internal pressure of arcjet test samples are sought. Modern ablation codes such as FEAR and CHAR solve the Darcy flow equations to track both the internal pyrolysis gas pressure and mass flow. However, there is currently no data available to validate the internal pressure calculations due to a lack of a reliable and accurate measurement system. The internal pressure calculation becomes even more important when analyzing flexible thermal protection system materials which are highly porous.

TA14 Thermal Management Systems,TA14.2 Thermal Control Systems,Z2.01Active Thermal Control Systems for Space Exploration, JSC,"NASA is seeking unique solutions for mid-temperature thermal control technologies that will facilitate a low mass highly reliable thermal control system for an exploration vehicle. Future human spacecraft will require more sophisticated thermal control systems that can operate in severe environments ranging from full sun to deep space and can dissipate a wide range of heat loads. Planetary systems (both human and robotic) need to minimize mass and maximize performance to enable more science payloads, and face complications from dust and regolith in many locations, and from the Mars atmosphere. The systems must perform their function while using fewer of the limited spacecraft mass, volume and power resources while increasing the reliability of these components. Furthermore, as human missions require longer extravehicular activities, the need for a closed loop, mass efficient thermal control system is needed for the EVA Suit. NASA's Technology Roadmaps 6 and 14 cover many of the defined key performance parameters sought through this SBIR. The following sub-topics seek to cover the gaps outlined through this solicitation. Variable Heat Rejection Technologies As NASA moves beyond low earth orbit, exploration vehicles that must accommodate various mission scenarios find a need for variable heat rejection. A vehicle may need to operate in severe environments ranging from full sun to deep space while managing a wide range waste energy rejection including active and dormant phases. Heat rejection systems and/or radiators that can operate at low fractions of their design heat load in the cold environments that are required for deep space missions. Room temperature thermal control systems are sought that are sized for full sun yet are able to maintain set point control and operate stably at 25% of their design heat load in a deep space (0 K) environment. This variation in heat rejection is often described as a turn-down ratio. NASA Technology Roadmap Area 14 outlines a turn down goal of 6 to 1 by a thermal control system operating at the scale of kilowatts of waste energy removal. Solutions for variable heat rejection may include the use of novel thermal control fluids, advanced radiator technologies, and/or variable conductance. Advanced-Closed Loop EVA Thermal Control NASA has evolved space suit technology beyond the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) state of the art for exploration missions. However, the latest iteration of the portable life support system includes the use of a Suit Water Membrane Evaporator to facilitate the rejection of waste energy produced by the suit, which still vents water vapor like the EMU sublimators. Longer duration extra vehicular activities and systems that do not impact the environment of Mars are needed, including a closed loop, non-venting EVA thermal control system capable of working in the Martian atmosphere. The solicitation seeks novel approaches to close the thermal control system of the Suit so that minimal to no consumables are used for rejection of waste energy. Approaches may include, but are not limited to, novel radiative approaches, desiccant systems to reclaim evaporants, etc. Examples of such technologies and goals are outlined in NASA's Technology Roadmap Area 06. Highly Efficient, Low Pour Point Thermal Control Fluids Most if not all space vehicles have the need for a thermal control fluid that does not freeze at relatively low temperatures. These fluids with low pour points come with decreased thermal performance, causing an increase in system mass to the thermal control system. This scenario was apparent with JPL’s Mars Science Laboratory as well as the Orion Vehicle. Vehicles subjected to the environments of deep space through transit scenarios to the Moon and Mars especially need a highly efficient thermal control fluid with low pour point. Ideally, this new thermal control fluid would have a pour point near -110°C with thermal physical properties near water. Furthermore, for use in human systems, this thermal control fluid would have low toxicity, flammability, and vapor pressures for use in a habitable volume. Advanced Heat Exchangers Air/liquid, liquid/liquid, coldplates, and phase change material heat exchangers are at the core of any thermal control system for a vehicle. Advances in manufacturing may yield a considerable mass savings over the current state of the art heat exchangers. Furthermore, lightweight non-venting phase change heat exchangers are sought to ameliorate the environmental transients that would be seen in planetary (Martian or Lunar) orbit. Heat exchangers that have minimal structural mass and good thermal performance are sought. Furthermore, the use of phase change materials that have a transition temperature between 8°-12°C with heat of fusions above 200 kJ/kg are needed. The goal is a ratio exceeding 2/3 phase change material mass and 1/3 structural mass. Condensing heat exchangers (air/liquid heat exchangers) are deemed to be a critical component of a closed loop environmental control life support system. The need for highly reliable condensing heat exchangers that do not contaminate due to microbial growth and do not impact the water processing system of an ECLSS system due to coatings on the HX is of high need for future human systems. Finally, advances in the aforementioned heat exchangers are expected to utilize new materials and manufacturing techniques over conventional brazing processes used today. NASA's Technology Roadmap Area 14 details various points of interest for these heat exchangers. Read less>>"," GRC, GSFC, JPL, MSFC"
TA15 Aeronautics,TA15.1 Additional Subtopics,A1.04Aerodynamic Efficiency - Active Flow Control Actuation Concepts, LaRC,"Active flow control (AFC) technology has the potential to be a key contributor to achieving NASA’s aeronautics goal of revolutionizing the energy efficiency and environmental compatibility of fixed wing transport aircraft. Active flow control is the on-demand addition of energy into a boundary layer for maintaining, recovering, or improving vehicle performance. Since Prandtl’s discovery of the boundary layer, AFC actuation methods have included steady mass transfer via suction or blowing, and unsteady perturbations created by zero net mass flux actuators, plasma actuators, and fluidic oscillators. Previous wind tunnel and flight tests demonstrated that this technology is capable of improving vehicle performance by reducing and/or eliminating separation and increasing circulation. When integrated into a transport aircraft, therefore, AFC would result in smaller control surfaces creating less drag and thereby less fuel consumption during flight. Widespread application of the technology on commercial transports, however, requires that AFC actuators and systems be energy-efficient, reliant, and robust. Another challenging aspect of the design of the actuation system involves understanding how and where to integrate the actuator into the vehicle. Computational tool development is also needed in parallel with actuator development to enable a more synergistic approach to active flow control system design thus maximizing the potential benefits of an AFC system.This solicitation is for robust, energy-efficient, reliable actuation systems with the control authority needed to control turbulent separation thus improving circulation on simply hinged flaps systems and other aircraft control surfaces during the subsonic portion of the flight regime and/or to control shock induced separation on vehicles in cruise during the transonic portion of the flight regime. Areas of specific interest where research is solicited include but are not limited to the following: Experimental or computational investigations aimed at control of turbulent boundary layer separation due to large adverse pressure gradients or shock/boundary layer interactions. Development of novel, energy-efficient, and robust actuators for controlling boundary layer separation. Development of computational tools to model the performance of a proposed actuator concept. Development of closed-loop active flow control systems with demonstrated improvements in AFC efficiency measured by the energy consumed by the AFC actuator. Experimental evaluation of realistic AFC actuators applied to separated flows. Experimental and computational studies that demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed actuation system. Development of computational tools to model the flowfield resulting from the application of active flow control on an airfoil or wing. Read less>>", AFRC
TA15 Aeronautics,TA15.1 Additional Subtopics,A1.06Vertical Lift - VL Measurement Techniques and Condition-Based Maintenance, ARC,"The Vertical Lift subtopic is primarily interested in the following two areas: Health management of drive systems for vertical lift vehicle is critical to reliable operations and safety. Predictive Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) improves safety, decreases maintenance costs, and increases system availability. A topic of interest in CBM includes analysis capabilities and models to simulate operating drive systems and components, including the modeling of realistic anomalies and faults that can help design and qualify CBM systems, and test their utility in making maintenance decisions. These CBM simulation capabilities should be of sufficient fidelity, demonstrated by validation and verification performance metrics, to allow development of CBM systems that include: differentiation between different failure modes, detection of onset and progression of failures, identification of the damaged component, assessment of damage severity, measurement of usage to predict remaining life, and recommendation of maintenance actions required. Proposals based only on novel post-processing of accelerometer data will not be considered for award. Accurate measurements of lift systems and blade aerodynamics are key to developing and validating high-fidelity analyses and designing next-generation high-performance vertical lift systems. A topic of interest is instrumentation and measurement techniques for assessing blade boundary layer state (e.g., laminar flow, transition, turbulent flow) of a rotating blade system in hover and forward flight conditions. IR thermography is one technique for identifying transition but the technique typically requires heating (or cooling) the blade to enhance temperature differentials between the blade and the ambient air. Techniques, IR or non-IR, are sought that are non-intrusive or minimally non-intrusive. Both on-surface and off-surface techniques that can be efficiently applied to new or existing blades for testing in a wind tunnel or in flight are desired. Proposals on other vertical lift technologies will also be considered however the primary emphasis of this solicitation will be on the above two identified technical areas. Read less>>"," GRC, LaRC"
TA15 Aeronautics,TA15.1 Additional Subtopics,A1.08Aeronautics Ground Test and Measurements Technologies, LaRC,"NASA's ground-based test facilities, which include low speed, transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic wind tunnels, hypersonic propulsion integration test facilities, air-breathing engine test facilities, and simulation and loads laboratories, play an integral role in the design, development, evaluation, and analysis of advanced aerospace technologies and vehicles. In addition to design databases, these facilities provide critical data and fundamental insight required to understand complex phenomena and support the advancement of computational tools for modeling and simulation. The primary objective of the Aeronautics Ground Test and Measurements Technologies subtopic is to develop innovative tools and technologies that can be applied in NASA’s ground-based test facilities to enhance testing and measurement capability and improve utilization and efficiency. For this solicitation, NASA seeks proposals for innovative research and development in the following areas:Force and Moment Balances - Internal and external balances provide foundational data to evaluate aerodynamic performance and validate numerical solutions. To meet future testing and accuracy requirements, NASA is interested in new innovative balance designs for full- and semi-span test articles that incorporate new sensors, materials, manufacturing techniques, and calibration methods. Systems that are capable of transferring high pressure air and/or power across the balance and operating at high temperatures (up to 350F) are especially desired. Wind Tunnel Calibration and Characterization - Capabilities for wind tunnel calibration and characterization are critical for overall enhancement of facilities and will play a critical role in achieving the CFD 2030 Vision [1]. Non-intrusive measurement systems offering multi-component velocities, density, and pressure in the tunnel stream upstream and downstream of test articles are required to routinely quantify tunnel inflow and outflow conditions for the purposes of establishing boundary conditions for advanced numerical simulations. These systems should include provisions for combining these data into the regular stream of test data provided by a given facility. Model Attitude and Position Monitoring - Measurements of wind tunnel model attitude and position (e.g., roll, pitch, yaw angles and spatial coordinates X, Y, Z relative to a defined origin and coordinate system) are critical but are often difficult to make due to packaging constraints, model orientations where gravity based sensors are not applicable, and test configurations that require multiple angle of attack systems. To address some of these limitations, optical, non-intrusive techniques are needed to provide real-time or near real-time measurements of model attitude at high data rates (10 Hz – 8kHz) and with sufficient accuracy (0.005± 0.0025° in pitch 0.025±0.025° in roll and yaw). The setup and calibration time required for these systems should be 4 hours or less to minimize the impact on tunnel operations. Many NASA wind tunnel facilities conduct tests at elevated temperatures (above 700° F) or at extremely low temperatures (-250° F). Displacement measurement components in actuator systems for the setting of hydraulic cylinder positions and other hardware used in test article support and positioning systems must operate routinely in these environments. Innovative designs and hardware solutions are desired to provide accurate and reliable performance at these extreme conditions. Improved Operational Efficiencies and Data Throughput. - Technologies are needed to significantly increase the amount of data acquired per test point, including simultaneous measurement of multiple flow parameters at high acquisition rates to capture rapidly evolving or oscillatory flow phenomena. Methods that exploit wireless sensor capabilities to reduce instrumentation cabling are of interest, including wireless strain gauge systems and technologies that can be applied for strain measurement on high speed rotating fan/rotor blades. Virtual environments that provide data fusion for real-time comparisons between wind tunnel data and computational results are also desired as well as technologies that integrate knowledge capture, training, and best practices for improved operational efficiencies, especially for activities that occur on an infrequent basis like calibration and characterization.

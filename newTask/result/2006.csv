Channel coding efficiency from 50% to 87%, combined with good bit-error/burst-error correction property will provide solutions to multiple missions. A high-speed, digital receiver capable of demodulating coded modulations in addition to un-coded modulations is needed for future missions. In compression, implementation of a high-speed decoder for decoding a standard embedded bit-stream offering tunable lossy compression to lossless compression is desired.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.02Precision Spacecraft Navigation and Tracking, GSFC," GRC, JPL","This call for proposals is meant to serve NASA's ever-evolving set of missions, which require precise tracking of spacecraft position and velocity in order to achieve mission success. The call seeks evolutionary improvements in modularity, sustainability, cost, and performance for current space navigation concepts that support the Vision for Space Exploration. This includes Projects Constellation, Prometheus, robotic servicing, and robotic Earth and space science missions. NASA also seeks disruptive navigation concepts that might not match the modularity, sustainability, cost, and/or performance of current technologies and their near-term evolution, but have convincingly demonstrable potential to overtake the evolution of current technologies within the future development of Projects Constellation and Prometheus, and Earth and space science missions, in the 2015 - 2020 timeframes. While the definition of ""precise"" depends upon the mission context, typical interplanetary scenarios have required Earth-based radiometric ranging accuracies of order 1-2m at 1 AU, Doppler to 0.03 mm/sec, and plane-of-sky angles to 2.5 nano-radians. While some legacy applications remain at 2.3 GHz, most current tracking is being done at 8.4 GHz. Forward looking demonstrations are being planned at 32 GHz. These radiometric techniques have been complimented by optical techniques which achieve ~1.5 micro-radian angular accuracy upon target approach. The accuracy of radio-based techniques is typically limited by one's ability to calibrate the path delay through intervening media (troposphere, ionosphere) and by the phase stability of electronics in both the spacecraft and ground systems. For both media and electronics, the stability goal is to achieve Allan standard deviations of 4e-15 at 100 seconds and 1.5 e-15 at 1e3 to 1e4 seconds while maintaining, or improving upon, current levels of reliability. Space navigation technology concepts should support launch and return to Earth, including range safety, early orbit operations, in-space assembly, cis-lunar and interplanetary transit, lunar and planetary approach and orbit, ascent and descent from lunar and planetary surfaces, including precision landing, lunar and planetary surface operations, automated rendezvous and docking, and formation flying spacecraft forming synthetic apertures for science imaging and interferometry. NASA considers applicability to multiple operational regimes through modularity and/or missionization of common components a key element in its exploration strategy. Space navigation systems must produce accurate long-term trajectory predictions as well as definitive epoch solutions. Where applicable, proposed concepts should be interoperable with and/or leverage the resources of NASA's space communications architecture. All navigation systems should be compatible, where applicable, to continuous or near-continuous trajectory perturbations generated by onboard spacecraft systems. All concepts must show some significant advantages over current techniques in at least one of the following areas: accuracy, cost, reliability, modularity, sustainability, or for onboard systems, mass, power, and volume. Innovative technologies are sought in the following areas:Highly phase-stable RF ground systems are critical to high accuracy radiometric tracking. Present systems rely upon analog transmission over 0.5 to 10 km distances of a broadband (100 - 600 MHz) spectrum. Transmission induced phase errors could be greatly reduced by developing highly phase stable digital sampling and time tagging systems that can be placed near (~10m) to the RF feedhorn without measurably degrading the RF signal capture with spurious tones and noise. Phase stability goals are given above. The sampler should Nyquist sample the 100 - 600 MHz band with at least 8-bit resolution and be capable of digitally transmitting the resulting samples over fiber optic lines; The VLBI parameter estimation software used to build the radiometric reference frames used for precise tracking relies on a Square Root Information Filter that makes use of Householder transformation techniques. These solutions often take several days of CPU on a modern workstation. Block matrix techniques have the potential to optimize the interaction of the CPU and cache memory thereby greatly reducing the CPU time needed for solutions. The goal is a factor of three improvement in total solution time for problems with 7 million data points and 500,000 parameters, which include at least 5000 parameters that are active over the entire data set; Microwave radiometry of atmospheric emission lines (22 GHz H2O, 60 GHz O2) has been successful in demonstrating 1 mm level calibration of tropospheric path delay. However, the usefulness of this technique has been limited by the large mass and size of the instrument packages. Identifying/developing low mass, low cost implementations of this technique without significantly sacrificing accuracy would greatly enhance precise tracking; Develop low mass, (Less than 1 kg) low cost onboard radio frequency standards for generating highly phase-stable onboard radio signals which achieve Allan standard deviations of 1 x 10-15 at 1000 seconds and drift of less than 10-15/day; Develop innovative tracking technologies using new wavelengths (X-ray, Infra-red, etc.), such as systems using celestial and planetary emissions and reflections (not limited to the visible spectrum) that can produce three-dimensional absolute and relative position and velocity in regions where Earth-based GPS measurements are not available, The technologies can exploit either ground based or on-board techniques; Develop innovative technologies for improving the state of the art in terms of cost and performance in making spacecraft-to-spacecraft measurements, such as omni-directional range and bearing sensors and robotic-vision-based systems; and Develop innovative navigation algorithms and software supporting analysis, design, and mission operations that will reduce operations costs and support multiple systems in simultaneous, tightly-coupled, non-quiescent operations, such as robotic servicing and formation flying.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.03Communication for Space-Based Range, GSFC," AFRC, KSC","Metric tracking of launch vehicles for range safety purposes is currently based on redundant radars, telemetry receivers, and uplink command transmitters at the launch site with additional assets deployed downrange in order to maintain line-of-sight communications with the vehicle as it passes over the horizon to orbital insertion. The vision of space-based range architecture is to assure public safety, cut the costs of launch operations, decrease response time, and improve geographic and temporal flexibility by reducing, or eliminating, these assets. In order to achieve this, a number of advancements in tracking and telemetry are required. Some of NASA's needs are: GPS/IMU Metric Tracking and Autonomous Systems Realization of a space-based range requires development of GPS receivers that incorporate:Low power consumption; Low mass/volume; Compliance with range safety standards; Flexible tracking loop programmability; Programmable output formats; and Operability in high G environments. Other highly desirable GPS specific characteristics include open architecture supported by development software and the capability of being incorporated onto circuit boards designed for multiple functions. Tactical grade IMUs are needed which can function on spin-stabilized rockets (up to 7 rps) and reliably function during sudden jerk and acceleration associated with launch and engine firings and can be coupled with GPS receivers. Also needed are approaches to processing the outputs of navigation sensors and combining them with rule-based systems for autonomous navigation and termination decision making. Space-Based Telemetry Small, lightweight, low cost transceivers capable of establishing satellite communications links for telemetry and control during the launch and assent stages of flight are required to provide unbroken communications throughout the launch phase. These may enable use of the NASA TDRSS, or commercial communications satellites. Techniques for multiplexing narrow bandwidth channels to permit increased bit rates and improved algorithms for ensuring smooth transition of support between communications satellites are also needed. GPS Attitude Determination for Launch Vehicles Investigate using inexpensive arrays of GPS antennas and receivers on small, expendable launch vehicles to determine the attitude angles and their rates of change as an alternative to traditional inertial measurement units. The system should be contained entirely on the vehicle and not rely on ground-based processing. The attitude accuracy should be comparable to gyroscope-based systems and should be free of drift and gimble lock. The system must be able to maintain attitude output during periods of high dynamics and erratic flight. The attitude must be determined at a rate of least 10 Hz with minimal processing delay and must be output in a format compatible with vehicle telemetry systems. Read less>>"
Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.04Antenna Technology for Spacecraft and Planetary Surface Vehicles, GRC," GSFC, JPL, LaRC","NASA seeks advanced antenna systems for use in spacecraft and planetary surface vehicles used in science, exploration systems, and space operations missions. Future manned missions to the Moon and Mars will have stringent communication requirements. Highly robust communication networks will be established in the vicinity of the planet to support long-term human interplanetary mission. Such networks will consist of a large number of communication links that connect the various network nodes. Some of these nodes must also maintain continuous high data rate communication links between the moon and the Earth. Great demands will be placed on these communication systems to assure crew safety, robustness in harsh environments, and high reliability for long duration manned missions. Areas of interest include lightweight deployable antenna systems, high-gain antenna architectures, multi-frequency and dual polarized antennas, self-orienting systems, reconfigurable antennas, novel concepts, antennas that can adapt to failed components without compromising performance and operability (e.g., smart antennas that include structural health monitoring and active control). NASA seeks to develop a lightweight scanning phased array antenna system that enables assured communication links for human interplanetary exploration. NASA is also interested in technologies enabling direct conversion of RF signals to digital and advanced concepts wherein such systems are integrated with novel smart antenna concepts to allow true interoperability and reconfigurability in the sense of software radios. Antenna systems for novel navigation concepts (e.g. pulsar beacons) as well as integrated communications and navigation architectures are desirable. Large inflatable membrane antennas to significantly reduce stowage volume, provide high deployment reliability, and significantly reduced mass (i.e. High efficient, miniature antennas with smaller than lambda square aperture size, to provide astronauts and robotics communications for surface to surface and surface to orbit for lunar, Mars, and planetary exploration missions. Recent new antenna research and development has shown that it is possible to design and build aperture antennas with smaller than the minimum effective apertures size of dipoles. This new class of antennas can provide higher antenna gains (> 2.5 dBi) than the dipole antenna in much smaller aperture size ( The architecture for lunar exploration as defined by the Space Communication Architecture Working Group (SCAWG) is expected to involve a layered communications and navigation network. This network may include lunar vicinity relay satellites at L1 and L2 Lagrange points as well as lunar polar orbiting satellites. The lunar proximity network must be able to access dedicated assets such as Malapert Station and eventually include human assets, such as crewed rovers, as relay nodes. Consequently there is an interest in antenna technologies that enable low cost but reliable reconfigurable and agile antennas at frequencies up to 38 GHz. Another component technology that shows high interest in the area of Earth and planet science is thin-membrane mountable T/R modules, phase shifters, beam former, control circuitry, etc. for future deployable/inflatable large-aperture phased array application. This topic seeks novel smart antenna concepts to address the aforementioned requirements. There is also interest in space-to-surface links at 25.5 GHz and 37 GHz. The size of reflector antennas is limited by the accuracy of the reflector surface that can be achieved and maintained on-orbit. Development of special materials and structural techniques to control their environment, etc., reduces environmentally induced surface errors and increases the maximum useable reflector size. Distortions caused by thermal gradients are inherently a large scale phenomenon. The reflector surface is usually sufficiently accurate over substantially large local areas but these areas are not on the same desired parabolic surface. An array of feed elements can be designed to illuminate the reflector with a distorted spherical wave. This distortion can be used to compensate for large scale surface error introduced by thermal gradients, gravitational and other forces, and manufacturing. Topics of interest include but are not limited to: Compensating Feed System for an Antenna Reflector Surface With Large Scale Distortions; Techniques for the remote Measurement of Satellite Antenna Profile Errors; Determination of Orbiting S/C Antenna Distortion by Ground-Based Measurements; Measuring and Compensating Antenna Thermal Distortions; Reflector Measurements and Corrections using arrays; Reflector Distortion Measurement and Compensation Using Array Feeds. NASA is interested in low cost phased array antennas for suborbital vehicles such as sounding rockets, balloons, UAV's, and expendable vehicles. The frequencies of interest are S-band, Ku-band, and Ka-band. The arrays are required to be aerodynamic in shape for the sounding rockets, UAV's, and expendable platforms. The balloon vehicles primarily communicate with TDRS and can tolerate a wide range of mechanical dimensions. Antenna pointing techniques and technologies for Ka-band spacecraft antennas that can provide spacecraft knowledge with sub-milliradian precision (e.g., NASA is designing arrays of ground-based antennas to serve the telecommunications needs of future space exploration. Medium-size (12m class) antennas have been selected for receiving, and arrays of hundreds of them are expected to be required. Applications include communication with distant spacecraft; radar studies of solar system objects; radio astronomy; and perhaps other scientific uses. A significant challenge is the implementation of an array for transmitting (uplinking), which may or may not use the same antennas that are used for receiving. The uplink frequency will be in the 7.1 - 8.6 GHz band (X-band) in the near term and may be in the 31.5 - 33.0 GHz band (Ka-Band) in the future; it will likely carry digital modulation at rates from 10 kbps to 30 Mbps. An EIRP of at least 500 GW is required, and some applications contemplate an EIRP as high as 10 TW. It is also desirable to support as many as ten simultaneously-operating deep-space missions from one complex on Earth, and to have at least three geographically separated complexes so communication is possible with a given spacecraft at any time of the day. The major open questions in the uplink array design are:Minimizing the life-cycle cost of an array that produces a given EIRP by selecting the optimum combination of antenna size, transmitter power, and number of antennas. This becomes much more difficult if the option of using the same antenna for both uplink and downlink is considered; Identifying/developing low-cost, highly reliable, easily serviceable components for key systems. This could include highly integrated RF and digital signal processing electronics, including mixed-signal ASICs. It could also include low-cost, high-volume antenna manufacturing techniques. (For the receiving array, another key component is a cryogenic refrigerator for the 15 - 25K range.) Also, low-cost transmitters (including medium-power of the order of 100s of Watts) amplifiers are key; Phase calibration techniques are required to ensure coherent addition of the signals from individual antennas at the spacecraft. It is important to understand whether space-based techniques are required or ground-based techniques are adequate. In general, a target spacecraft in deep space cannot be used for calibration because of the long round-trip communication delay; Design of ultra phase-stable electronics to maintain the relative phase among antennas. These will minimize the need for continuous, extensive and/or disruptive calibrations; Understanding the effect of the medium (primarily the Earth's troposphere) on the coherence of the signals at the target spacecraft. Generally, turbulence in the medium tends to disrupt the coherence in a way that is time-dependent and site-dependent. A quantitative understanding of this is needed; and Techniques for integrating a very low-noise, cryogenically-cooled receiver with medium power (1W to 200W) transmitter. If transmitting and receiving are combined on the same antenna, the performance of each should be compromised as little as possible while maintaining low cost and high reliability.Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward a Phase 2 hardware demonstration that will, when appropriate, deliver a demonstration unit for testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.05Reconfigurable/Reprogrammable Communication Systems, GRC," GSFC, JPL, JSC","NASA seeks novel approaches in reconfigurable, reprogrammable communication systems to enable the Vision for Space Exploration, Science, and Space Operations. Exploration of the Moon and Mars will require advancements in communication systems to manage the demands of the harsh space environment on space electronics, maintain flexibility and adaptability to changing needs and requirements, and provide flexibility and survivability due to increased mission durations. NASA missions can have vastly different transceiver requirements and available resources depending on the science objective, operating environment, and spacecraft resources. For example, deep space missions are often power constrained; operating over large distances, and subsequently have lower data transmission rates when compared to near-Earth or near planetary satellites. These requirements and resource limitations are known prior to launch; therefore, the scalability feature can be used to maximize transceiver efficiency while minimizing resources consumed. Larger platforms such as vehicles or relay spacecraft may provide more resources but may also be expected to perform more complex functions or support multiple and simultaneous communication links to a diverse set of assets. This subtopic seeks advancements in reconfigurable transceiver and component technology, providing flexible, reconfigurable capability while minimizing on-board resources and cost. The use of open standards within the software radio development is desirable while minimizing potential increased resources and inefficiencies. Topics of interest include the development of software defined radios or radio subsystems which demonstrate reconfigurability, flexibility, reduced power consumption of digital signal processing systems, increased performance and bandwidth, reduced software qualification cost, and error detection and mitigation techniques. Complex reconfigurable systems will provide multiple channel and simultaneous waveforms. Areas of interest can be divided as follows: Signal Waveforms and On-Orbit ReconfigurationMultiple waveforms and multiple channel support strive to reduce radio count to reduce power consumption of the overall communication system. Tradeoffs in radio count and radio complexity are considered in the analysis. Reconfiguration for software and firmware upgrades shall provide access control, authentication, and data integrity checks for the reconfiguration process. Partial reconfigurable logic allows simultaneous operation and upload of new waveforms or functions. Upon operator or automated load detection failure, capability to provide access back to a known, reliable operational state is needed. An automated restore capability ensures the system can revert to a baseline configuration, thereby avoiding permanent communications loss do to an errant reconfiguration process. Approaches should minimize size and power consumption for deep space transceivers incorporating fault tolerant, reprogrammable digital signal processing devices. Implementations demonstrating the concept function, and benefits of dynamic or distributed on-board processing architectures to provide maximum reconfigurability and processing capacity are sought. A common processing system capacity for communications, science, and health monitoring is envisioned. Demonstration of adaptive modulation and waveform recognition techniques are desired to provide capability to reconfigure to the waveform identified based on an on-board library or enable new waveform upload to the on-board library from the ground. Software Architecture, Implementation, Modeling and VerificationDevelopment and demonstration of low overhead, low complexity hardware and software architectures to enable software component or design reuse, or common testing standards that demonstrates cost or time savings. Emphasis on the application of open standards architecture to facilitate interoperability among different vendors to minimize the operational impact of upgrading hardware and software components. Methods that enable portability among reconfigurable logic hardware devices among different vendors, different device families and types of digital processing technologies. As the use of software and firmware increases with more flexible and portable software defined radio technologies, methods are sought to reduce the complexity and cost to space qualify and verify software operation for use in space yet maintain or increase on-orbit reliability. Techniques to ensure reliable software execution and failure detection and self-correction. One promise of a software defined radios is software and design reuse maintained in a common repository. The cost or ability to reuse software depends on implementation, development practices, code complexity and other circumstances. This subtopic seeks the development and demonstration of software tools or tool chain methodologies to enable both design and software code reuse. Fault ToleranceThe use of reconfigurable logic devices in software defined radios is expected to increase in the future to provide reconfigurability and on-orbit flexibility for waveforms and applications. As the densities of these devices continue to increase and feature size decreases, the susceptibility of the electronics to single event effects also increases. Novel approaches to mitigate single event effects caused by charged particles are sought that reduces power consumption and complexity compared to traditional approaches (i.e., voting schemes and constant updates (scrubbing)). Techniques and implementations to provide a core waveform capability within the software defined radio in the event of failure or disruption of the primary waveform and/or system hardware. Communication loss should be detected and core or ""gold"" waveform automatically executed to provide control access to diagnosis system and over-the-air reload operational waveform and control software. Radio ArchitecturesInnovative solutions to provide software defined radio implementations to reduce power consumption and mass. Solutions should promote modularity and common, open interfaces. Software defined radio implementations that enable future hardware scalability among different mission classes (e.g., low rate deep space to moderate or high rate near planetary, or relay spacecraft). Operational characteristics range from 1's to 10's Mbps at UHF and S-band frequency bands up to 10's to 100's Mbps at X, and Ka-band frequency bands.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.06Extravehicular (EVA) Radios, JSC, GRC,"This subtopic focuses on dramatically shrinking the size of the EVA radio by selecting and using micro-machined RF components in the development of a Phase 1 circuit design which demonstrates compact high Q selective devices to propose for Phase 2 to fully fabricate and demonstrate a prototype radio incorporating the compact high Q filter technology developed and demonstrated during Phase 1. This subtopic seeks proposals to close a critical technology gap in the ability to reduce the form factor and power requirements of the EVA Radio while increasing its selectivity and performance, enabling long duration human exploration while simultaneously increasing communications reliability and crew safety. Miniature EVA Radio Human exploration demands versatile, lightweight, and miniaturized EVA Radios to enable surface operations and increase astronaut mobility. The size, weight, and power consumption of EVA Radios must dramatically decrease to reduce overall mission costs. These EVA Radios cannot sacrifice performance for weight, power, and form factor requirements - in fact, quite the opposite. While the form factor shrinks, the performance must increase to handle the combination of voice, data, and video needed to support the complex tasks in the next generation of manned mission scenarios. EVA Radios based on micromachined RF components eliminate the most bulky pieces - the RF components in the diplexers, pre-selectors, and bandpass filters. For example, most high rejection diplexers for space-based radios are almost as enormous as the modern radio package itself. Micro-machined RF elements can complement space radio technology by coupling high-performance and increased reliability with reduction in size. Besides low spatial volume, a significant mass reduction, and low-power consumption, micro-machined RF devices are also attractive to operate as high Q components to perform frequency selectivity without mass penalties. To build and design high performance, tightly coupled, low volume space radios, compact selectivity-determining devices are a critical enabler. Most high Q filters above 400MHz, such as inter-digital filters and others involving resonant cavities, tend to be wholly mechanical assemblies whose size is generally governed by their frequency and some derivative of their resonate wavelength. By applying micro-machining techniques, the same filter assemblies employing advanced 3D packaging techniques can be ""folded"" in the design, which is conducive to an order of magnitude improvement in utilization of EVA radio volumetric space. New EVA Radio Capability The intent of this subtopic is to develop, apply and demonstrate advantages of micro-machined RF component-based circuitry that proliferate the implementation of next-generation lightweight EVA radios. Areas of investigation may include electromechanically tuned filters, 3D packaged, micro-machined RF resonators, filter configurations consisting of cantilevered structures, as well as carbon nanotube waveguide assemblies. Through application of these fabrication and packaging techniques great strides will be realized in improving functionality, enhancing performance and achieving high reliability for long duration manned space missions. Miniature EVA Radio features include:Dramatic reduction of mass; Dramatic reduction in power requirements; High selectivity components, reducing interference and overlap; High reliability through Fault Tolerant design; Frequency agility; Software defined waveforms and modulation/demodulation. Technical Approach The design and use of circuitry using micro-machined RF components to dramatically shrink EVA Radio form factor while increasing operational performance will be supported by investigations and trade studies selecting current and near-term micro-machined RF components, culminating in a circuit design demonstrating their use to make a high Q element. Phase 2 will harness the high Q element as a model; then design an overall EVA Radio architecture compliant with Space Transportation Radio System (STRS) embracing a fault tolerant hardware design. The tradeoffs in sensitivity, selectivity, and packaging will be investigated in the Phase 2 effort. Commercialization Plan By providing users with a small size, low power, high performance SDR-based radio platform, the miniature EVA radio has derivative uses far beyond the scope of space exploration. The combination of micro-machined RF assemblies and 3D packaging in the miniature EVA radio has vast implications for both future space exploration and commercial wireless and mobile radio communications: First Responders: Interoperability among Police, Fire, HazMat, Homeland Security, and Medical personnel Military: Soldier-centric secure communications, mode switchable on-the-fly Commercial: Cell phones, pagers, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/UWB radio integration Read less>>"

Besides low spatial volume, lightweight, and low-power consumption, these devices are also attractive to operate as high Q components and perform frequency selectivity - namely, agile pre-selectors, multi-couplers, and diplexers. Selectivity, or Q, for band pass filters currently comes at an unacceptably high penalty in size and mass. For example, most high rejection diplexers for space-based radios are almost as enormous as the modern radio package itself.

Some of the nodes will be fixed (base stations and relays to orbital assets) and some will be moving (rovers and humans). The ability to meet the demanding environments presented by lunar and planetary surfaces will encompass the development and integration of a number of communications and networking technologies and protocols, including: Low mass/power (100's of milliwatts) transceivers for very short range interfaces with sensors and other small devices to enable communications among humans, robots, and access network terminals; Reconfigurable, directionally selectable, steerable, multi-frequency switched patch or multiple-in multiple-out antenna arrays for human helmets, robots, and fixed structures (e.g. habitats); Miniaturized planar, omni-directional, dual-polarized, self-orienting, and sector antennas for surface-to-surface communications among mobile and fixed nodes; Low power space rated ASICs and FPGAs for wireless network products; short ( Fixed, long (up to 50km) range, wireless network terminals for extending high data rate communications over large distances; Integrated, autonomous tracking and navigation architectures and technologies; Self-healing, ad-hoc, disruption tolerant network protocols for intelligent, autonomous link management and reliable throughput. Access Links Lunar and planetary surface networks will need to seamlessly interface with communications access terminals and orbiting relays that can provide autonomous and disruption tolerant connectivity to Earth based assets. The access link communications system will encompass the development and integration of a number of communications and networking technologies and protocols: High rate, efficient solid state amplifiers capable of very high data rates over 1,000 - 10,000 km distances with ranging signal embedded; Very low power, data rate, and cost inter-spacecraft S-band transceivers for inexpensive spacecraft; Optical transceiver capable of very high data rates over 1,000 - 10,000 km distances; Agile, multi-beam antennas; mesh or other material flexible reflector unfurlable antennas for Ka-band and lightweight scanning phased array antenna systems; SEU and solar flare tolerant transponder capable of programmable wide carrier frequency range from S-band to Ka-band, taking GPS measurements, and handling IP at the digital level; Micro software radio technology for autonomous and intelligent space applications; Low mass, volume, power, and cost stable oscillators to provide accurate time and frequencies for autonomous operations; Autonomously reconfigurable receivers capable of automatic link configuration and management; Microwave ranging hardware built into communication system for rendezvous and collision avoidance; Ad-hoc, long-range spacecraft to spacecraft network protocols to set up links on demand such that each node can route data through to another node.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.11Software for Space Communications Infrastructure Operations, JPL," ARC, GSFC","The current infrastructure for NASA Space Communications provides services for near-Earth spacecraft and deep-space planetary missions. The infrastructure assets include the Deep Space Network (DSN), the Ground Network (GN), and the Space Network (SN). Recent planning for the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) for human exploration to the moon and beyond as well as maintaining vibrant space and Earth science programs resulted in a new concept of the communications architecture. The future communications architecture will evolve from the present legacy assets and with addition of new assets. New technology is sought to improve resource optimization and the user interface of planning and scheduling tools. The software created should have a commercialization approach with the new modules fitting into an existing or in-development planning and scheduling tool. Proposals are sought in the following three areas: Intelligent Assistants In order to automate the user's provision of requirements and refinement of the schedule, ""intelligent assistant"" software should manage the user interface. Assistants should streamline access and modification of requirement and schedule information. By modeling the user, this software can adjust the level of autonomy by determining what decisions should be made by the user or the automated system. Assistants should try to minimize user involvement without making decisions the user would prefer to make. The assistants should adapt to the user by learning their control preferences. This technology should apply to local/centralized and collaborative scheduling. In a conflict-aware scheduling system (especially in a collaborative scheduling environment), conflicts are prevalent. With the concept of one big schedule from the beginning of time, real time, to the end of time, resolving conflicts become a difficult task especially since resolving conflicts in a local sense may affect the global schedule. Therefore, an intelligent assistant may provide decision support to the system or the users to assist conflict resolution. This may involve a set of rules combining with certain local/global optimization to generate a list of options for the system or users to choose from. Resource Optimization The goal of schedule optimization is to produce allocations that yield the best objectives. These may include maximizing DSN utilization, minimizing loss of desired tracking time, and optimizing project satisfaction. Each project may have their own definition of satisfaction such as maximal science data returned, maximal tracking time, best allocation of the day/week, etc. The difficulty is that we may not satisfy all of these objectives during the optimization process. Obviously, optimal solution for one objective may produce worse results for the other objectives. One possible solution is to map all of these objectives to an overall system goal. This mapping is normally non-linear. Technology needs to be developed for this non-linear mapping for scoring in addition to regular optimization approaches. Multiple Agents In an environment where all system variables can be controlled by a single controller, an optimal solution for the objective function can be achieved by finding the right set of variables. In a collaborative environment with multiple decision makers where each decision maker can only control a subset of the variables, modeling and optimization become a very complex issue. In the proposed collaborative scheduling approach, there are many users/agents that will control their own allocations with interaction with the others. How we model their interactions and define system policy so the interaction can achieve the overall system goal is an important topic. The approach for multiple decision-maker collaboration has been studied in the area of Game Theory. The applications cover many areas including economics and engineering. The major solutions include Pareto, Nash, and Stackelberg. There are many new research areas including incentive control, collaborative control, Ordinal Games, etc. Note that intelligent assistants and multiple agents represent different points on the spectrum of automation. Current operations utilize primarily manual collaborative scheduling, intelligent assistants would enhance users ability to participate in this process and intelligent agents could more automate individual customers scheduling. Ideally, proposed intelligent assistants and distributed agents would also be able to represent customers who do not wish to expose their general preferences and constraints. A start for reference material on this subtopic may be found at the following:http://ai.jpl.nasa.gov in the publications area; http://scp.gsfc.nasa.gov/gn/gnusersguide3.pdf, NASA Ground Network User's Guide, Chapter 9 Scheduling; andhttp://scp.gsfc.nasa.gov/tdrss/guide.html, Space Network User's Guide, SpaceOps Conference Proceedings.

These views will be used to determine the objects' approximate geometric sizes and shapes. The potential application is to help track and identify debris quickly after an accident or flight anomaly. The data will be provided by sequential digital images from one or more tracking cameras, ideally operating autonomously. The goal is to track and identify between 50 to 100 objects with typical cross-sections varying from tens of square meters down to one square meter or less within several minutes after an accident. The initial investigation will determine the minimum size that can be imaged using current technology, the probability of correctly estimating an object's size and shape, the processing speed, and the means for transmitting analyzed data to the command center. GPS or Radar-aided Autofocus Investigate using range information from radar, GPS, or other sources, for autofocusing long-range optics systems. Optical tracking provides valuable data during aerospace operations, but large distances between the target and the optical system can lead to distortions caused by atmospheric disturbances. Range information might be useful for a computer-controlled optical focusing system to decrease this distortion. The initial investigation will determine if this approach could be useful using one or multiple cameras, how it might be implemented, and if range information could be combined with other distortion-reduction techniques. New Optical Tracking Systems Investigate innovative and unconventional ways to use optical or hyperspectral imaging systems to visualize and track vehicles during launch and landing operations. Possibilities might include, but are certainly not limited to, unmanned aerial vehicle platforms or balloons. The system must be implemented unobtrusively in a spaceport environment. The initial investigation should result in a proof-of-concept demonstration in an appropriately scaled environment.Read less>>"

The ability to quickly and efficiently perform system certification greatly impacts all space programs. Instrumentation and Sensors NASA's SSC is concerned with expanding its suite of non-intrusive technologies that provide information on propulsion system health, the environments produced by the plumes and the effects of plumes and constituents on facilities and the environment. Current capabilities include non-intrusive optical methods of monitoring plumes for metallic contamination from erosion and wear, measuring the radiative and acoustic energies and as well as measuring the concentrations of environmentally sensitive species.

The wide range of pressures, flow rates, and temperatures necessary for engine testing result in complex relationships and dynamics. It is not realistic to physically test each component and the component-to-component interaction in all states before designing a system. Currently, systems must be tuned after fabrication, requiring extensive testing and verification.

Space Operations,Topic O2 Space Transportation ,O2.03Automated Collection and Transfer of Launch Range Surveillance/Intrusion Data, KSC, GSFC,"Range surveillance is a primary focus of launch range safety and often cost and schedule drivers as well. Launch delays due to difficulty in verifying a cleared range are common and will increase as development encroaches on existing spaceports and as spaceports are built in new areas. Proposals are sought for innovative sensors, instrumentation platforms, and communication technologies which expedite range clearance by providing real-time situational awareness for range operations such as launches, hazardous processing, and recovery.Instrumentation platforms will provide mobile or transportable surveillance assets for broad area coverage to meet range needs. These platforms should be capable of a high degree of self-sufficiency and autonomy for unattended, long-term operations. During operations the platform must maintain stability so that instruments are not required to compensate for unique environmental characteristics surrounding the operations.

In addition, multiple sensors and instruments may be used, or combined through the use of neural networks and data fusion, for accurate identification, and time and position of entities.Centric and integrated communications schemes that adhere to widely accepted standards will enable a scalable architecture for range instrumentation that supports launch operations. Data rates and bandwidth requirements may vary greatly depending on instrumentation and sensors that are incorporated on a range.

These hazards may include weather and other atmospheric phenomena, terrain, traffic, aircraft system failures, and aircraft/operator interactions. Research proposals are sought in the area of 4D vehicle-centric trajectory and mission management, with emphasis on mission planning, external hazard response, and workload reduction. The three major research areas covered by this subtopic are: Mission Planning Dynamic changes in an aircraft's tactical situation require rapid generation of a flight plan that best accomplishes a global set of mission goals. Mission management (MM) uses cost functions and any-time planning algorithms to produce feasible flight plans. The specific capabilities desired in this area are the generation and specification of 4D trajectories, and defining requirements and constraints (look-ahead time, ground system interface, aircraft system integration, etc.) related to the planning of such trajectories. Response to Detected External Hazards Sensing systems detect obstacles, weather and other constraints in the flight path; MM commands short-term trajectory change, with compensating downstream legs to minimize schedule impact. Capabilities expected from this research are automated decision making and path planning in the presence of external hazards, along with requirements for the creation of automation systems to accomplish such tasks. Workload Reduction On-the-fly generation of complex mission-driven flight plans for search patterns, data collection experiments, and tracking problems.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.03Aircraft Aging and Durability, GRC," AFRC, ARC, LaRC","Aircraft aging is a significant national issue that is being addressed by government agencies, manufacturers, operators, and academia. NASA's contribution to solving the problem is research on aging and damage processes in ""young"" aircraft, rather than life extension of legacy vehicles. Its emphasis is on new and emerging material systems/fabrication techniques and the potential hazards associated with their aging-related degradation. The intent is to identify aging-related hazards before they become critical, and develop technology to anticipate aging and maintenance needs in the design of future aircraft. NASA performs multi-level research in aging science leading ultimately to multi-disciplinary analysis and optimization capabilities that will enable system-level integrated detection, prediction and mitigation of aging-related hazards in future civilian and military aircraft. To further the fundamental understanding of the underlying physics and to develop an ability to model the physical processes, foundational research is conducted in the following areas: sensing and diagnostic technologies; physics-based modeling; continuum-based models and computational methods; material science (metals, ceramics, composites); and characterization/validation test techniques. Building upon foundational research yields discipline-based products: nondestructive evaluation (NDE) systems; structural integrity tools; lifing methods; and concepts to mitigate aging-effects. By integration of discipline-based tools, multi-disciplinary methods and technologies are developed; e.g., detection capability is enhanced by coupling NDE with structural integrity analysis, prediction capability is enhanced by applying NDE (and vehicle health monitoring data) to improve model input and provide improved predictions of remaining life and strength, and mitigation capability is enhanced by applying predictive models to help develop advanced mitigation concepts. Specifically, NASA requests proposals that assimilate the above multi-layer approach, which provide innovative solutions to one of the following problems:The use of integral metallic structure in airframe application provides unique crack growth and fracture characteristics that are not consistent with traditional metallic structure characteristics. Computational methods for elasto-plastic crack propagation, including non-self-similar growth and bifurcation of 2D and 3D cracks, are needed for predicting crack growth in complex metallic geometries. Computational methods must be incorporated into a user interface software tool.Computational methods for the prediction of strength of composite and metal/composite hybrid skin-stringer fuselage present the following technical challenges: numerical regularization techniques to improve convergence of delamination propagation simulation; and X-FEM for failure prediction that address interaction between in-plane and interlaminar failure modes. Solutions to these two challenges are sought.Novel techniques for large-area nondestructive evaluation (detection of damage and material degradation) of metallic and composite fuselage and wing structure are needed.Adhesive bonds are critical to integrity of built-up structure. Disbonds (i.e., gaps) can often be detected, but the strength of the adhesion between surfaces in contact is not obvious. Methods to detect bond degradation, predict disbond growth, and characterize weak bonds are needed.Advanced composite concepts for jet engine containment structures have unknown long-term service/environment effects. Better models and tools are needed for understanding these effects and for predicting engine blade-off event physics (i.e., the high strain-rate impact) to reduce risk and cost.New nickel-based superalloys which enable higher turbine disk operating temperatures have been developed. However, tools to understand and mitigate the long term durability and aging characteristics (e.g., microstructural instability and corrosion) of these alloys are needed.Degradation and damage that develops over time in engine hot section components can lead to catastrophic failure. Methods and sensors for characterization of degradation processes of these components (including ceramics) in harsh environments during system development are needed.Faults and hazards in aging vehicle wiring persist as a problem in legacy vehicles, and will pose risks in new vehicles. Novel methods (i.e., have not already been researched by FAA and DoD) are sought to detect and characterize degradation, and to predict useful life of wiring systems. Technology innovations may take the form of tools, models, algorithms, prototypes, and devices. Read less>>"

Combustion for aerospace vehicles typically involves multi-phase, multi-component fuel, turbulent, unsteady, 3D, reacting flows where much of the physics of the processes are not completely understood. CFD codes used for combustion do not currently have the predictive capability that is typically found for non reacting flows.

Aeroelastic behavior of flight vehicles is a particularly challenging facet of that goal. The program's work on aeroelasticity includes conduct of broad-based research and technology development to obtain a fundamental understanding of aeroelastic and unsteady-aerodynamic phenomena experienced by aerospace vehicles, in subsonic, transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic speed regimes. The program content includes theoretical aeroelasticity, experimental aeroelasticity, and advanced aeroservoelastic concepts.

The technical discipline of aeroelasticity is a critical ingredient necessary in the design process of a flight vehicle for assuring freedom from catastrophic aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic instabilities. This discipline requires a thorough understanding of the complex interactions between a flexible structure and the unsteady aerodynamic forces acting on the structure, and at times, active systems controlling the flight vehicle.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics ,A2.05Aerodynamics, LaRC," AFRC, ARC, GRC","The challenge of flight has at its foundation the understanding, prediction, and control of fluid flow around complex geometries - aerodynamics. Aerodynamic prediction is critical throughout the flight envelope for subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic vehicles - driving outer mold line definition, providing loads to other disciplines, and enabling environmental impact assessments in areas such as emissions, noise, and aircraft spacing. In turn, high confidence prediction enables high confidence development and assessment of innovative aerodynamic concepts. This subtopic seeks innovative physics-based models and novel aerodynamic concepts, with an emphasis on flow control, applicable in part or over the entire speed regime from subsonic through hypersonic flight. All vehicle classes will experience subsonic flight conditions. The most fundamental issue is the prediction of flow separation onset and progression on smooth, curved surfaces, and the control of separation. Supersonic and hypersonic vehicles will experience supersonic flight conditions. Fundamental to this flight regime is the sonic boom, which to date has been a barrier issue for a viable civil vehicle. Addressing boom alone is not a sufficient mission enabler however, as low drag is a prerequisite for an economically viable vehicle, whether only passing through the supersonic regime, or cruising there. Atmospheric entry vehicles and space access vehicles will experience hypersonic flight conditions. Reentry capsules such as the new Crew Exploration Vehicle deploy multiple parachutes during descent and landing. Predicting the physics of unsteady flows in supersonic and subsonic speeds is important for the design of these deceleration systems. The gas-dynamic performance of decelerators for vehicles entering the atmospheres of planets in the solar system is not well understood. Reusable hypersonic vehicles will be designed such that the lower body can be used as an integrated propulsion system in cruise condition. Their performance is likely to suffer in off-design conditions, particularly acutely at transonic speeds. Advanced flow control technologies are needed to alleviate the problem. This solicitation seeks proposals to develop and validate:Turbulence models capturing the physics of separation onset at Reynolds numbers relevant to flight, where relevant to flight is dependent on a targeted vehicle class and mission profile;Boundary-layer transition models suitable for direct integration with state-of-the-art flow solvers;Active flow control concepts targeted at separation control with an emphasis on the development of novel, practical, lightweight, low-energy actuators;Wake decay models capturing the relevant physics into the near, mid, and far fields;Innovative aerodynamic concepts targeted at vehicle efficiency or control;Physics-based models for simultaneous low boom/low drag prediction and design;Aerodynamic concepts enabling simultaneous low boom and low drag objectives;Innovative methods to validate both flow models and aerodynamic concepts with an emphasis on aft-shock effects which are hindered by conventional wind tunnel model mounting approaches;Accurate aerodynamic analysis and multidisciplinary design tools for multi-body flexible structures in the atmospheres of planets and moons including the Earth, Mars, and Titan; Advanced flow control technologies to alleviate off-design performance penalties for reusable hypersonic vehicles.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics ,A2.06Aerothermodynamics, ARC," AFRC, GRC, LaRC","The accurate prediction of aerothermal environments is of crucial importance for meeting current goals of subsonic, supersonic and hypersonic thrust areas as well as supporting future missions of NASA by reducing uncertainties in design and development. Development of highly accurate tools to predict aerothermal environments and associated effects on vehicles is needed to enable advanced spacecraft for future missions. Radiative heating has not been a critical issue for the Space Shuttle Orbiter due to its relatively low reentry velocities on the order of 7.5 km/s, or for other entry probes such as Genesis and Stardust due to their small sizes. However, the Crew Exploration Vehicle's large size and high reentry velocities of approximately 10.5 km/s during lunar return missions make it imperative to study the phenomenon of shock layer radiation. Aerocapture missions to Titan, Neptune, and Venus also require the study of radiative heat transfer as well as of the internal structure and dynamics of the constituent gases. Transition and turbulence effects are particularly complex in hypersonic flows because of the presence of shocks, real gas effects, non-smooth body surfaces with difficult-to-quantify roughness distributions, effects of nose bluntness, ablation, surface catalyticity, separated flows, and an unknown free-stream disturbance environment. At heating rates encountered during hypersonic re-entry, the surface is ablating and the interaction of ablation products blowing into the boundary layer induces new interactions (chemical reactions, radiation absorption) that have strong impacts on surface heating rates and integrated heat loads. Aerothermal analyses and management are furthermore relevant to the design of advanced propulsion systems. The isolators and nozzles in both rocket-based and turbine-based combined cycle engines are critical components of future reusable hypersonic vehicles. Major research and technological advances are required in order to develop Ultra-High Bypass Ratio engines and high power density cores. A better fundamental understanding coupled with the ability to accurately simulate the aerothermodynamics of highly loaded turbomachinery is needed, along with innovative ideas such as flow control for increasing fan and compressor work factors without sacrificing efficiency and operability. Improvements in turbine cooling effectiveness, secondary flow, and component matching are also important for high-pressure ratio engines.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics ,A2.08Experimental Capabilities and Flight Research, AFRC, LaRC,"Advances to the state of the art in both Experimental Capabilities and Flight Research are needed to support almost every aspect of the Fundamental Aeronautics programs under development in NASA. These tools will be used to generate experimental data for the creation and validation of advanced prediction models, as well as evaluate advanced concepts, both in the laboratory and in suitable facilities (e.g. wind tunnels, flight tests, etc.).

Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics ,"A2.09Aircraft Systems Analysis, Design and Optimization", ARC, LaRC,"One of the approaches to achieve the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Program goals is to solve the aeronautics challenges for a broad range of air vehicles with system-level optimization, assessment and technology integration. The needs to meet this approach can be defined by four general themes: (1) Design Environment Development, (2) Variable Fidelity, Physics-Based Design/Analysis Tools, (3) Technology Assessment and Integration, and (4) Evaluation of Advanced Concepts. Current interdisciplinary design/analysis involves a multitude of tools not necessarily developed to work together, hindering their application to complete system design/analysis studies. Multi-fidelity, multi-disciplinary optimization frameworks, such as Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS), have been developed by NASA but have limited capabilities to simulate complete vehicle systems. Solicited topics are aligned with these four themes that will support this NASA research area. (1) Design Environment Development Technology development is needed to provide complex simulation and modeling capabilities where the computer science details are transparent to the engineer. A framework environment is needed to provide a seamless integration environment where the engineer need not be concerned with where or how particular codes within the system level simulation will be run. Interfaces and utilities to define, setup, verify, determine the appropriate resources, and launch the system simulation are also needed. Research challenges include the engineering details needed to numerically zoom (i.e. numerical analysis at various levels of detail) between multi-fidelity components of the same discipline, as well as, multi-discipline components of the same fidelity. A major computer science challenge is developing boundary objects that will be reused in a wide variety of simulations. Proposals will be considered that enable coupling differing disciplines, numerical zooming within a single discipline, deploying large simulations, and assembling and controlling secure or non-secure simulations. (2) Variable Fidelity, Physics-Based Design/Analysis Tools An integrated design process combines high-fidelity computational analyses from several disciplines with advanced numerical design procedures to simultaneously perform detailed Outer Mold Line (OML) shape optimization, structural sizing, active load alleviation control, multi-speed performance (e.g. low takeoff and landing speeds, but efficient transonic cruise), and/or other detailed-design tasks. Current practice still widely uses sequential, single-discipline optimization, at best coupling low-fidelity modeling of other relevant disciplines during the detailed design phase. Substantial performance improvements will be realized by developing closely integrated design procedures coupled with highest-fidelity analyses for use during detailed-design. Design procedures must enable rapid determination of sensitivities (gradients) of a design objective with respect to all design variables and constraints, choose search directions through design space without violating constraints, and make appropriate changes to the vehicle shape (ideally both external OML shape and internal structural element size). Solicitations are for integrated design optimization tools that find combinations of design variables from more than one discipline and can vary synergistically to produce superior performance compared to the results of sequential, single-discipline optimization or repeated cut-and-try analysis. (3) Technology Assessment and Integration Improved analysis capability of integrated airframe and propulsion systems would allow more efficient designs to be created that would maximize efficiency and performance while minimizing both noise and emissions. Improved integrated system modeling should allow designers to consider trade offs between various design and operating parameters to determine the optimum design for various classes of subsonic fixed wing aircraft ranging from personal aircraft to large transports. The modeling would also be beneficial if it had enough fidelity to enable it to analyze both conventional and unconventional systems. Current analysis tools capable of analyzing integrated systems are based on simplified physical and semi-empirical models that are not fully capable of analyzing aircraft and propulsion system parameters that would be required for new or unconventional systems. Analyses tools are solicited that are capable of analyzing new and unconventional aircraft and propulsion integrated systems. These include: (1) New combustor designs, alternate fuel operation, and the ability to estimate all emissions, and (2) Noise source models (fan, jet, turbine, core and airframe components). Analyses tools that are scalable, especially to small aircraft, are desired. (4) Evaluation of Advanced Concepts Conceptual design and analysis of unconventional vehicle concepts and technologies is needed for technology portfolio investment planning, development of advanced concepts to provide technology pull, and independent technical assessment of new concepts. This capability will enable ""virtual expeditions through the design space"" for multi-mission trade studies and optimization. This will require an integrated variable fidelity concept design system. The aerospace flight vehicle conceptual design phase is, in contrast to the succeeding preliminary and detail design phases, the most important step in the product development sequence, because of its predefining function. However, the conceptual design phase is the least well understood part of the entire flight vehicle design process, owing to its high level of abstraction and associated risk, its multidisciplinary design complexity, its permanent shortage of available design information, and its chronic time pressure to find solutions. Currently, the important primary aerospace vehicle design decisions at the conceptual design level (e.g., overall configuration selection) are still made using extremely simple analyses and heuristics. An integrated, variable fidelity system would have large benefits. Higher fidelity tools enabling unconventional configurations to be addressed in the conceptual design process are solicited.

Shallow core, rock, and regolith samples may be variable in size and composition so a sample manipulation system needs to be flexible enough to handle the sample variability. Core samples will be on the order of 1 cm diameter and up to 10 cm long. Soil and rock samples will be of similar volumes. Actual samples to be analyzed in instruments will likely be small subsamples so the means for subsampling and manipulation of the original sample and subsamples needs to be developed. Minimal size and mass components and systems have the greatest benefit. Mobility technology is needed to enable access to difficult-to-reach sites such as distant locations or access through steep terrain. Many scientifically valuable sites are accessible only via terrain that is too steep for state-of-the-art planetary rovers to traverse. Sites include crater walls, canyons, and gullies. Tethered systems and marsupial systems are two examples of mobility technologies that are of interest. Tether technology could enable new approaches for deployment, retrieval and mobility. Innovative marsupial systems could allow a pair of vehicles with different mobility characteristics to collaborate to enable access to challenging terrain, e.g., a primary vehicle could provide long traverse to the vicinity of a challenging site and then deploy a smaller vehicle with steep mobility access capability for access to the site. Innovative low-mass, low-power, and highly modular systems and subsystems are of particular interest. The program is also interested in new sensors such as small, low-power lidar for more robust navigation. Examples of planetary robotics system are shown at http://robotics.jpl.nasa.gov. Read less>>"
Science,Topic S1 Robotic Exploration of the Moon and Mars ,S1.02Subsurface Robotic Exploration, JPL, ARC,"Robust systems for accessing the subsurface of the Moon and Mars are critical to the next generation of robotic explorers. Limited spacecraft resources (power, volume, mass, computational capabilities, and telemetry bandwidth) demand innovative, integrated sampling systems that can survive and operate in challenging environments (extremes in temperature, pressure, gravity, vibration and thermal cycling). Research should be conducted to develop compact, low-power, lightweight subsurface sampling systems with access to depths of 1 - 3 m below the surface. A relevant mission scenario for this type of drill would include drilling multiple holes from a mobile platform, such as a rover. For reference, current Mars-relevant rovers range in mass from 200 - 800 kg. Consideration should be given to potential failure scenarios for integrated systems. For example, recovery and mitigation techniques for platform slip and borehole misalignment should be addressed. Significant attention should be given to the sensing and automation required for real-time control, fault diagnosis and recovery. Additional areas of interest include understanding the limitations of dry drilling into mixed media, including icy mixtures of rock and regolith. Also of particular need are means of acquiring subsurface rock and regolith samples with minimum contamination. This contamination may include contaminants brought to the sample by the drill itself, material from one stratigraphic layer contaminating samples collected at another depth (sample cross-contamination), or Earth-source microbes brought to the Martian surface prior to drilling ('clean' sampling from a 'dirty' surface).

Flexible, lightweight active arrays enable better packaging efficiency for the antenna and are critical for these missions. These antennas will be deployed on orbiting spacecraft and on rovers or aerial platforms such as lighter than atmospheres (LTA) vehicles or airplanes. When used for active remote sensing, L-band also provides the capability to detect surface and subsurface topology including density contrasts within the ice or dust and subsurface water or warm ice. In addition, the use of L band frequencies enables proximity communications between the in situ vehicle and a spacecraft in orbit or on a flyby trajectory. Currently, manufacturing reliable passive arrays with required tolerances is challenging and the only method for integration of the electronics is to attach and interconnect the electronic components on the surface.

Proposals are sought in the following areas: Hot Air (Montgolfiere) Balloons for Titan NASA is considering the use of hot air (Montgolfiere) balloons for Titan using waste heat from the radioisotope power source (RPS). Proposals are sought for concepts and prototypes for this balloon that have the following nominal characteristics: 2000 Watts of available RPS waste heat, a 100 gm/m2 balloon envelope material, 160 kg of payload mass (including the RPS but excluding the balloon), and a controllable altitude over the range of 0 to 10 km with the ability to maintain a +/- 20 m tolerance near the surface (93K, 1.46 bar).

In a formation for large effective telescope apertures, multiple, collaborative spacecraft in a precision formation collectively form a variable-baseline interferometer. Large effective apertures can also be achieved by tiling curved segments to form an aperture larger than can be achieved in a single launch, for deep-space high resolution imaging of faint astrophysical sources. These formations require the capability for autonomous precision alignment and synchronized maneuvers, reconfigurations, and collision avoidance. It is important that, in order to enable precision spacecraft formation keeping from coarse requirements (relative position control of any two spacecraft to less than 1 cm, and relative bearing of 1 arcmin over target range of separations from a few meters to tens of kilometers) to fine requirements (micron relative position control and relative bearing control of 0.1 arcsec), the interferometer payload would still need to provide at least 1 - 3 orders of magnitude improvement on top of the S/C control requirements. The spacecraft also require onboard capability for optimal path planning and time optimal maneuver design and execution. Development of combined nanometer-level precision formation flying control of numerous spacecraft and their optics is required to enable large baseline (1 to 10's of km), sparse aperture UV/optical (and perhaps X-ray) telescopes and interferometers needed for ultra-high angular resolution imagery.

They will make use of large, sensitive detector arrays with low-power dissipation array readout electronics. Improvements in sensitivity, stability, array size, and power consumption are sought. In particular, novel doping approaches to extend wavelength response, lower dark current and readout noise, novel energy discrimination approaches, and low noise superconducting electronics are applicable areas. Future space observatories in the 40 micron to 1 mm spectral regime will be cooled to even lower temperatures, frequently < 10 K, greatly reducing background noise from the telescope.

Although the relative value of the improvements may differ among the four energy regions, many of the parameters where improvements are needed are present in all four bands. In particular, all bands need improvements in spatial and spectral resolutions in the ability to cover large areas and in the ability to support the readout of the thousands to millions of resultant spatial resolution elements. Innovative technologies are sought to enhance the scope, efficiency, and resolution of instrument systems at all energies and wavelengths:The next generation of gravitational missions will require greatly improved inertial sensors. Such an inertial sensor must provide a carefully fabricated test mass, which has interactions with external forces (i.e., low magnetic susceptibility, high degree of symmetry, low variation in electrostatic surface potential, etc.) below 10-16 of the Earth's gravity, over time scales from several seconds to several hours. The inertial sensor must also provide housing for containing the proof mass in a suitable environment (i.e., high vacuum, low magnetic and electrostatic potentials, etc.);Advanced Charged Couple Device (CCD) detectors, including improvements in UV quantum efficiency and read noise, to increase the limiting sensitivity in long exposures and improved radiation tolerance. Electron-bombarded CCD detectors, including improvements in efficiency, resolution, and global and local count rate capability.

Improvements in readout electronics, including:Low-power ASICs and the associated high-density interconnects and component arrays to interface them to detector arrays;Superconducting tunnel junction devices and transition edge sensors for the UV and X-ray regions. For the UV, these offer a promising path to having ""three-dimensional"" arrays (spatial plus energy).

Techniques are sought which improve the QE of photon counters, or eliminate the read noise of solid-state detectors; and X-ray and Gamma-ray imaging with higher sensitivity, dynamic range and angular resolution requires innovations in modulation collimators and detection devices.

Innovations are needed to reduce spacecraft propulsion system mass, volume, and/or cost. Applicable propulsion technologies include advanced chemical, emerging technologies, and aerocapture. Advanced Chemical Propulsion Innovations in low-thrust chemical propulsion system technologies are sought for robotic, deep-space, scientific, mission applications. Delta Vs for the missions of interest range from 1000 m/sec to 3000 m/sec. Advanced chemical propulsion technologies of interest are:Advanced material and component technology to enable development of bipropellant engines with Isp greater than 360 seconds, both pressure-fed and pump-fed, with chamber pressures ranging from 100 to 500 psia systems; Non-catalytic ignition technology and critical component materials (e.g., tank bladders, valve seats, and filters) for power-limited spacecraft using high-performance (Isp >275 s), high-density (>1 g/cc) monopropellant formulations. Tether Technologies Focus on technologies that support the development of tethers that can survive in the space environment. The near-Earth environment contains a significant amount of atomic oxygen (AO) formed by photo-dissociation of atmospheric oxygen. This AO attacks the chemical bonds of polymeric materials, which are desirable for their high specific tensile strength. Furthermore, ultraviolet radiation also attacks tether materials. A coating for a polymeric tether must be able to protect the tether against both effects. Coatings that can be uniformly applied after the fabrication of a multi-strand tether structure are especially desirable, because of the requirement that a space tether have a multitude of separate load paths in the event of a cut by an orbital debris particle. Certain materials (such as titanium oxide/zinc oxide) offer both ultraviolet radiation protection as well as atomic oxygen resistance. Tether technologies of interest are:Techniques and processes to coat and protect polymeric tether materials from offer both ultraviolet radiation protection as well as atomic oxygen resistance effects. Such coatings must be as thin as possible because of the importance in maintaining a high specific tensile strength in tether materials, although they must be able to adhere uniformly and reliably to tether materials, even in the face of winding and ground handling. Degradation to the strength characteristics of the tether generated by the coating process must be absolutely minimized. Aeroassist (Aerocapture) Aerocapture relies on the exchange of momentum with an atmosphere to achieve a decelerating thrust leading to orbit capture. This technique permits spacecraft to be launched from Earth at higher velocities, thus providing a shorter overall trip time. At the destination, the velocity is reduced by aerodynamic drag within the atmosphere. The aerocapture maneuver can be accomplished by utilizing either rigid or inflatable deceleration systems. Preliminary analysis has shown that the inflatable decelerator concepts may provide mass reduction and improved packaging efficiency over a rigid aeroshell system. However, the TRL for these inflatable decelerators must be increased before an adequate comparison to traditional rigid aeroshells can be made. Current inflatable decelerator concepts are expected to be manufactured from thin film materials, elastomeric materials, and/or high temperature fabrics, stowed during transport and inflated prior to atmospheric entry for aerocapture applications at planetary destinations. Materials of particular interest include: polyimide thin films, polybenzobisoxazole (PBO) thin films, and ceramic fabrics. Prior to the aerocapture maneuver, the inflatable decelerator will be tightly stowed for many years (up to 10 years) in an uncontrolled space environment (-130°C) during transport to outer solar system destination. Before final atmospheric entry, the inflatable decelerator will be unstowed and inflated (cold GN2). During the aerocapture maneuver, up to 24 hours after the inflation process is initiated, the inflatable decelerator will experience temperatures to 500°C (or higher). Low Temperature/High Temperature Structural Materials/Adhesives Development for Inflatable Deceleration Systems: This task focuses on the development and testing of structural materials/adhesives that can be utilized for aerocapture inflatable decelerator systems.

Traditional means of supporting vehicle health, such as invasive inspections, are extremely limited in their utility for exploration missions. Other solutions, such as ground-based monitoring of telemetry data, become less useful as communication delays or bottlenecks increase. Under these circumstances, autonomous and automated solutions to systems health management provide the best means of increasing crew safety and mission success probability for future space exploration missions. Another significant concern is the high cost of ground and mission operations. Future ground operations will require quick and efficient turnaround and processing of spacecraft for launch. In addition, new mission operations concepts must be developed to provide appropriate levels of safety and mission success factors while reducing support staff.

Intelligent automation of systems on crewed vehicles is instrumental for decreasing workload, reducing dependence on Earth-based support staff, enhancing response time, and reducing operations cost. Increased system autonomy for unmanned and manned vehicles reduces operations costs, while increasing operations efficiency and spacecraft capability by reducing the time required for humans to staff flight control positions and interact with the vehicles. To enable the application of intelligent automation and autonomy techniques, configuration and validation issues need to be addressed. Reusable automation software must be adaptable to new applications without undue difficulty, and easily adjusted as the application operations change. The overhead of applying automation techniques to new applications is one of the two key obstacles to acceptance of such techniques in operations. A variation of the same issue is that of adjustment as requirements and application contexts change, which is inevitable in spacecraft operations. The software and the adaptation to a given application must also be trusted before it can be accepted. Testing and other techniques are keys to establishing such trust and ensuring the correct function of automation systems. However, in both testing and validation, the complexity of intelligent software has proven to be a major obstacle. This has led to trust and correctness issues being another key obstacle to adoption of intelligent automation systems in both unmanned, and most importantly, in crewed vehicles.

Mars diurnal temperature changes from about -120°C to +20°C. All exploration endeavors, including robotic, habitat, and ISRU systems that are expected to reliably operate on the Moon or Mars surface for years will need electronics that are able to survive and operate in a wide temperature range and thermal-cycling environment. In addition, the electronics must operate reliably after a total ionizing dose (TID) >/= 50 krads (Si) and provide single-event latchup immunity (SEL) >/= 100 MeV cm2/mg. The lunar and Martian temperatures are well outside the specification range of military and commercial electronics. While many types of devices, especially Si CMOS transistors, can operate down to low temperatures, there are significant circuit design challenges that need to be addressed, especially in the case of mixed-signal and analog circuits. In addition, thermal cycling present in lunar and especially Mars environments introduces reliability concerns associated with mechanical stress and fatigue of the IC package.

Exploration Systems,Topic X9 Propulsion and Propellant Storage ,X9.03Cryogenic and Non-Toxic Storable Propellant Space Engines, GRC, JSC,"This subtopic intends to examine a range of key technology options associated with cryogenic and non-toxic storable propellant space engines. This engine technology is solicited for use in lieu of the toxic but currently operational nitrogen tetroxide and monomethylhydrazine engine technology, which has recently seen performance improvements from 310 to 325 seconds of specific impulse using advanced rhenium thrust chamber technology. Performance improvements are a consideration, but are not the main objective of this solicitation. The Space Shuttle Orbiter Upgrade Program identified non-toxic reaction control system (RCS) propulsion as a key technology to reduce vehicle operations costs on the ground, and estimated that a significant reduction in RCS propulsion system cost is possible by the use of non-toxic propellants. In addition, the use of astronaut extravehicular activity for in-space refueling of space systems or the refueling of vehicles with humans aboard such as the International Space Station is extremely hazardous with toxic propellants. These safety concerns drive mission planners to the use of more costly propulsion modules that are fueled and sealed on the ground. The general objectives of this solicitation derive from the NASA goals of safe, reliable, affordable and effective human and robotic missions in support of the overall U.S. Vision for Space Exploration. Successful proposals will be focused investments that systematically validate and/or invalidate key technologies and design concepts that might transform how the U.S. will pursue future space exploration goals. The specific technology to be supported by this subtopic is multi-use in-space cryogenic and non-toxic storable propellant rockets. This technology includes the development and demonstration of key operational and performance characteristics of a range of new space engines, i.e., orbit transfer, descent, ascent, and pulsing attitude control engines.

Proposals are solicited for both thruster development and thruster component technologies such as, but not limited to, long-life, highly reliable ignition systems, durable, low-mass propellant injectors, and long-life combustion chamber designs. Proposals are also solicited for propulsion system component technologies such as valves, instrumentation, controls, multi-purpose structures and both electric and turbine driven pumps.

Exploration Systems,Topic X9 Propulsion and Propellant Storage ,X9.04Nuclear Thermal Propulsion, GRC, MSFC,"NASA is interested in the development of critical technologies for first in-space applications of solid core nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) systems for use in future human exploration missions. For short round trip missions to Mars, NTP systems may be enabling by helping to reduce launch mass to reasonable values and by also increasing the payload delivered for Mars human exploration missions. Preliminary solid core NTP system concepts could be based on a high thrust/high Isp (~850 - 950s) NTP system that would use a fission reactor with U-235 fuel as its source of thermal energy. During the short primary propulsion maneuvers of a typical conceptual mission, large quantities of thermal power (100's of MWt) would be produced within the NTP system and removed using LH2 propellant that is pumped through the engine's reactor core. The superheated hydrogen gas is then exhausted out the engine's nozzle to generate thrust. Representative ranges of engine performance include: (1) hydrogen exhaust temperatures ~2500 - 2900 K, (2) propellant flow rates ~7 - 13 kg/s, (3) chamber pressures ~500 - 1500 psi, and (4) nozzle expansion area ratio ~200:1 - 500:1. Proposals are sought to further improve factors contributing to safety, performance, reliability, and life as well as reduce projected weight and costs for the first in-space NTP systems, subsystems, and components beyond that in previously achieved ground test systems.

Exploration Systems,Topic X10 Thermal Protection ,X10.01Ablative Thermal Protection System for CEV, ARC," JSC, LaRC","The Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) will first be used for transporting crew and cargo to the Space Station and later for the human exploration of the Moon and Mars. The Thermal Protection System (TPS) for the CEV will have to protect the crew and cargo from entry heating at entry velocities of approximately 8 km/s for Space Station missions, 11 km/s for lunar return missions, up to 8 km/s for Martian aerocapture and entry, and between 12 - 15 km/s for Martian return missions. Ablative TPS is an enabling technology for all CEV superorbital reentry missions. Ablation Modeling The heat shield for CEV will employ a TPS material that pyrolyzes and ablates at high temperature for mass-efficient rejection of the aerothermal heat load. Pyrolysis is an internal decomposition of the solid that releases gaseous species, whereas ablation is a combination of processes that consume heat shield surface material (including chemical reactions, melting, and vaporization). For the design and sizing of TPS materials, it is imperative to have reliable simulation tools that can compute surface recession rate, in-depth pyrolysis, and internal temperature histories under general heating conditions. In addition, lunar and Martian reentry environment heating will consist of significant radiation from the shock layer. The models need to include the effect of not only convective but radiative heating as well. Therefore, advances are sought in modeling of radiation, gas surface interactions, ablation mechanisms, pyrolysis, and other processes such as coking and charring. Specifically for charring, advances are sought in the development of a low density charring ablator model to give insight into how conductivity changes as function of temperature and pressure for the virgin material and for the material as it pyrolyzes. Instrumentation TPS sensors and experimental diagnostic tools are required to provide traceability of TPS sizing tools, design, and material performance. Traceability will lead to higher fidelity design tools, which in turn will lead to risk reduction and decreased heat shield mass on missions requiring atmospheric aerocapture or entry/reentry. Decreasing heat shield mass will enable certain missions that are not otherwise feasible and directly increase payload. Heat flux sensors and surface recession diagnostic tools are essential to advancing the state of TPS traceability for material modeling and aerothermal simulation. Advances in the understanding of how heat flux sensor performance changes upon integration of the sensors into TPS materials in ablative environments through simulation or experimental investigation are sought. Specifically, the following list of sensor materials is of primary interest:Type K, C, R, and S thermocouples Sapphire windows Inconel superalloys Pure platinum TeflonFor surface recession, advances in optical methods (photometrics/tomography) are sought. Non-destructive Testing Techniques and Novel Techniques for Material Characterization The CEV heat shield will be the largest ever built. During manufacturing and integration, it will be necessary to understand the variability in material properties, to determine voids and inclusions, to assess bondline integrity, and to ensure that the established flight heat shield requirements are met. For this purpose, advances in NDE and proposals of novel techniques for material characterization applicable for ablative TPS are sought. Ablation Materials Development Early NASA missions employed new ablative TPS materials that were tailored to each specific entry environment. However, after Mars Viking, NASA-sponsored ablative TPS development essentially ceased as the research focus shifted to reusable TPS in support of the Space Shuttle. For example, the Pioneer Venus (1978) and Galileo (1995) missions employed carbon phenolic TPS material that had previously been developed by the United States Air Force for ballistic missile applications. Over the past 40 years, NASA has adopted a risk averse philosophy relative to TPS, i.e. use what was used before since it has been flight-qualified. For Mars Direct Return, the entry velocities will be in the range of 12-15 km/s. Heritage carbon phenolic can satisfy Mars Return requirements however the TPS mass fraction would be less than optimal. Thus, advances toward new reliable and efficient TPS materials are desired. Similarly, development of adhesives, joints, penetrations, and seals are of equal importance and advances are sought. Read less>>"

During the Apollo program, landings were located and timed to occur at lunar twilight, resulting in a benign thermal environment. The long duration lunar bases that are foreseen in 15 years will see large variations in their thermal environment during the Moon's day/night cycle. Long stays remote from low-Earth orbit will require lightweight, but robust and reliable systems. Innovative thermal management components and systems are needed to accomplish the rejection of heat from lunar bases. Advances are sought in the general areas of radiators, thermal control loops and equipment, heat pumps, and thermal storage devices. For radiators on the Moon, lightweight deployable radiators are required that will operate at temperatures between 150 and 300K. Shading devices and strategies would allow them to reject more heat in the hot lunar environment. In addition, variable emissivity coatings would prevent freezing during the long, cold, lunar night. Also, the dusty environment of an active lunar base will require dust mitigation and removal techniques to maintain radiator performance over the long term. Heat pumps (especially high lift) may be required for heat rejection in the lunar environment. The lunar base active thermal control system will include high efficiency, long life mechanical pumps. Lightweight, high-performance thermal switches plus thermal energy storage and rejection devices could be used to accommodate the extremes of the available heat rejection. Part of the thermal control system in the lunar base is likely to be a condensing heat exchanger, which should be designed to preclude microbial growth. Thermal management of the lunar habitat, landers, and rovers may require mechanically pumped two-phase fluid loops. Innovative design of the loops and components is needed. A scaling methodology is needed to allow long term 1-g testing of two-phase systems (including pumped two-phase loops, heat pumps, and condensing heat exchangers) representative of the 1/6th Earth-normal gravity of the Moon. Lightweight, low volume, robust Extravehicular Activity (EVA) systems are needed that maximize human productivity and improve the capability to perform useful work tasks on the lunar surface. Low-venting or non-venting regenerable support subsystem(s) are needed for crewmember cooling, heat rejection, and removal of expired water vapor.

Since regularly timed resupply will not be possible for a Mars mission, all the prepackaged shelf-stable food, ingredients, and equipment to provide a complete diet for six crewmembers for more than three years will have to be provided at the beginning of the mission. Advancements are necessary to develop a combination of extended duration shelf-life stored foods augmented with fresh foods. Safe, nutritious, acceptable, and varied shelf-stable foods with a shelf life of 3 - 5 years will be required to support the crew during future exploration missions to the Moon or Mars. Development of shelf-stable food items that use high-quality ingredients is important to maintaining a healthy diet and the psychosocial well being of the crew. Shelf-life extension may be attained through new food preservation methods and/or packaging. Once on the lunar or planetary surface, it may be possible to use bulk packaging of meals or snack items. These food products will require specialized processing conditions and packaging materials. Current food packaging technologies represent a potentially significant trash-management problem for exploration-class missions to the Moon or Mars. New food packaging technologies are needed that minimize waste by using high barrier packaging with less mass and volume and/or by using packaging. Another opportunity would be development of a packaging material that can readily be reused by the crew to make objects of value to the space flight mission. All packaging materials must have adequate oxygen and water barrier properties to maintain the foods' 3 - 5 year shelf life. Food preparation systems will be required to heat and rehydrate the shelf stable food items and to prepare meals from the processed and resupplied items. Technologies to support on-orbit crew meal storage, preparation, dining activities, and trash dispensing are being sought. Food quality and safety are essential components in the maintenance of crew health and well-being. Efforts should be focused on control of food spoilage and food quality throughout the entire shelf life of the food. Effects of radiation on the stored food system quality are also needed. Food quality and safety efforts should be focused on identification and control of microbial agents of food spoilage, including the development of countermeasures to ameliorate their effects through food processing and food packaging.

New software needs to be fault tolerant and updated to current operating systems, new hardware and software must be fully documented (schematics, etc.). Areas of interest are:Advanced spaceflight detector systems to provide reliable environment data for a specific spectrum of energies, including real time dosimetry providing dose and particle types, and energies and cumulative dosimeters, for characterizing space environments for use onboard spacecraft and planetary surfaces, as well as alarm systems for Solar Particle Events. Dosimeters should provide time resolved linear energy transfer (LET) data and have embedded LET-based quality factor algorithms for determining dose equivalent. The expected radiation environment includes protons from 10 Mev to 1 GeV, electrons from .5 Mev to 7 Mev, primary and secondary HZEs (He to Fe) from 10 Mev/amu to 1 Gev/amu and secondary neutrons from 1 Mev to 200 Mev. NASA acknowledges the difficulty in measuring secondary neutrons from interactions of protons and heavy ions with spacecraft structures and has particular interest in this area. Read less>>"
Exploration Systems,Topic X14 Exploration Medical Capabilities ,X14.01Health Preservation in the Space Environment, JSC," ARC, GRC","Living and functioning efficiently and safely in space and in the hypogravity of the Moon (1/6g) or Mars (3/8g), requires an understanding of the effects of micro- and hypogravity and other space-environment related factors on human physiology responses and adaptations to a unique set of imposed demands. As a result, a variety of countermeasures are needed to mitigate the deleterious changes that occur during space flight and upon subsequent exposure to reduced-gravitational environments. The ability to monitor the effectiveness of countermeasures and alterations in human physiology during space exploration missions, particularly when several countermeasures are used concurrently, is equally important. This subtopic seeks innovative technologies in several very specific key areas. As launch costs relate directly to mass and volume, instruments and sensors must be small and lightweight with an emphasis on multi-functional capabilities. Low power consumption is a major factor, as are design enhancements to improve the operation, design reliability, and maintainability of these instruments in the environment of space and on planetary surfaces. As the efficient use of time is extremely important, innovative instrumentation setup, ease of usage, improved astronaut (patient) comfort, noninvasive sensors, and easy-to-read information displays are also very important considerations. Extended shelf-life and ambient storage conditions of consumables are also key necessities. Ability to operate in 0g, 1/6g, and 3/8g become more important as we march towards human Moon and Mars missions. Exercise and Related Hardware Miniaturized exercise hardware (treadmill or resistance exercise); physiological monitoring devices; and metabolic gas (carbon dioxide, oxygen) analysis systems for use with exercise and miniaturized interactive feedback and entertainment systems. A tool or toolkit should simulate and visualize the exercise device design and performance. A comprehensive, scaled 3D/virtual human model interface would be valuable to show biomechanical and kinetic effects of the exercise device. Relative physiological data from anthropometry to stress/fatigue to trauma/insult onset should be targeted. Noninvasive Pharmacotherapy and Monitoring Development of innovative technologies resulting in noninvasive methods for diagnosis, treatment, and therapeutic drug monitoring is needed to facilitate effective pharmacotherapy of humans in space. Many questions remain about the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals in micro- and hypogravity environments, which may interfere with their activity by sensitizing or desensitizing the crew member or interfering in other ways with the desired physiological effect. Micro-encapsulation of drugs and development of novel drug delivery systems under micro- and hypogravity conditions. Devices for continual monitoring of physiology during pharmacotherapy would also be advantageous to ensure that on-orbit expression of therapies relates to on-earth histories. Instrumentation for Noninvasive Measurement of Intracranial Pressure During Space Flight Abrupt transitions between differing gravitational environments have profound physiologic impacts on human space travelers. For instance, immediately following insertion of the spacecraft into Earth orbit, cephalad fluid shifting occurs. Over the next several days, all crewmembers onboard suffer from what has been termed Space Adaptation Syndrome (SAS) that varies in severity from person to person. The prevailing theory for the appearance of the constellation of symptoms (headache, malaise, vomiting, vertigo, etc.) which comprise this syndrome implicates a ""sensory conflict"" in information provided by the adapting vestibular system and by visual inputs. Another theory implicates the increased intracranial pressure (ICP) that likely accompanies the cephalad fluid shifts in the genesis of SAS. Additionally, decreased ICP following return to Earth's gravity may explain symptoms experienced by many crewmembers. Thus, novel approaches to noninvasive measurement of ICP are needed to determine the etiology and pathogenesis of the untoward physiologic effects that plague human space travelers during abrupt transitions between different gravitational environments. A more complete understanding of these phenomena will lead to better prevention and treatment modalities that will in turn decrease risks to the health and performance of crewmembers during transitional periods of both high to low and low to high gravity environments. Noninvasive Technology to Assess Bone Micro- and Macroarchitecture A complete assessment of bone strength will better monitor life-time skeletal integrity and will generate data critical for developing probability fracture risk models in younger crew members. Novel technology for non-invasive assessments of ""bone quality"" indices such as microarchitecture, macroarchitecture and trabecular bone mineral density (BMD). Read less>>"
Exploration Systems,Topic X14 Exploration Medical Capabilities ,X14.02Lunar In Situ Autonomous Health Monitoring, JSC," ARC, GRC","Exploration missions to the lunar surface will be characterized by science goals and objectives which will require crewmembers to actively investigate the accessible exterior environment via Extravehicular Activity (EVA). During the EVA sorties, it will be critical for the crewmembers to be able to monitor their personal health status and to make decisions based on feedback from intrinsic biomedical monitoring systems. Furthermore, it will be necessary to simplify these systems for rapid donning and doffing, automatic checkout capability, annunciation and guidance during suit anomalies, and ensuring the health and safety of each crewmember. Therefore, the sensors that will be used for biomedical monitoring need to be low profile (perhaps incorporated into an undergarment), accurate, reliable, and with as few wires as possible. In addition, the use of electrodes with electrode gel and overtapes has not been highly successful, resulting in skin irritation, adhesion problems, stowage concerns and limited life/inventory issues. Furthermore, our experience has demonstrated that commonality between and among systems is highly beneficial. For this reason, the biomedical sensors used for monitoring EVA should be applicable for intravehicular use as well. Some of the parameters that would be desirable for EVA monitoring include:Metabolic Rate Heart Rate Thermal Control ECG (possible) Oxygen Consumption Rate CO2 Level (in the oronasal area) CO2 Generation Rate Core and/or Skin Temperature Radiation Monitoring (possible) Oxygen Saturation LevelIn addition, development of device(s) capable of being used in an IVA system which is common with the EVA system is highly desirable. All of these, whether used for IVA or EVA, must be comfortable for the crewmember, allow the crewmember to continue performing tasks, and must not preclude normal activities when used for IVA monitoring (e.g. hygiene, eating, working at the computer, and exercising).

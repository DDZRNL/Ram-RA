Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,"O1.01Coding, Modulation, and Compression", JPL," ARC, GRC, GSFC","This subtopic aims to develop components in digital communication systems that offer both spectrum and power efficient solutions to NASA's future near-Earth, deep-space science and exploration applications. This area comprises technology in three key areas: forward error-correction (FEC) coding, data compression, and modulation. The state-of-the-art in flight for coding is (1) Reed-Solomon code concatenated with a convolutional codes, (2) turbo codes, and just emerging, (3) Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes. The first two have flown many times, and the initial designs for (3) are just being begun now. The state-of-the-art in compression is the CCSDS standard http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/122x0b1c1_e1.pdf(link is external). The state-of-the-art for modulation is BPSK and QPSK for deep space, and BPSK, QPSK, SQPSK, and 8-PSK for near Earth (TDRS) applications. Technology development is needed and required in the following areas: Coding The need is to handle signal degradation due to weather impact in Ka-band, RFI interference, and multi-path fading in NASA's future missions. A major challenge is developing coding schemes to handle long bursts of errors, up to 100,000 symbols long, at high processing rate. FEC coding technology to protect against long bursts of erasures due to radio frequency interference (RFI), weather conditions, fading, etc. An entirely new protection mechanism is needed for this long-outage scenario -- existing FEC codes of up to 16,000 are insufficient for this purpose. This technology would be needed in time for a first Ka-band-only mission in the 2015 time-frame. The target is a finished product at TRL 5. Data Compression The need is for a real-time high-speed hardware decoder for CCSDS 122.0-B-1 (http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/122x0b1c1_e1.pdf(link is external)). (A CCSDS 122.0-B-1 compliant encoder is already inserted into NASA's mission.) This hardware development effort would be a reference implementation of this standard, that could be used either as the basis for a flight unit, or as an independent validation test module for a flight unit or engineering model. The target is a finished product at TRL 6. Modulation Bandwidth efficiency is becoming increasingly important; missions desire simultaneous telemetry and ranging. Modulations and multiple access schemes for multiple spacecraft downlinking to a single antenna; expansion of SNIP code library – find more good PN spreading codes compatible with SNIP library; bandwidth efficient ranging – how to combine ranging with higher order modulations. Technology target is a demonstration at TRL 5. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward a Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration and deliver a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract. The proposer to this subtopic is advised that the products proposed may be included in a future small satellite flight opportunity. Please see the SMD Topic S4 on Small Satellites for details regarding those opportunities. If the proposer would like to have their proposal considered for flight in the small satellite program, the proposal should state such and recommend a pathway for that possibility. Read less>>"
Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.02Antenna Technology, GRC," ARC, GSFC, JPL, JSC, LaRC","NASA seeks advanced antenna systems in the following areas: phased array antennas; ground-based uplink antenna array designs; high-efficiency, miniature antennas; smart, reconfigurable antennas; large aperture inflatable/deployable antennas; and antenna adaptive beam correction with pointing control. Phased Array Antennas Low cost phased array antennas are needed to enable communication capabilities in the following areas: lunar and planetary exploration, including links between astronauts, landers, habitats, probes, orbiters, suborbital vehicles such as sounding rockets, balloons, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's), and expendable launch vehicles (ELV's). The frequencies of interest are S-, X-, Ku-, and Ka-band. The arrays are required to be aerodynamic or conformal in shape for sounding rockets, UAV's, and expendable platforms. They must also be able to withstand the launch environment. The balloon vehicles communicate primarily with TDRS and can tolerate a wide range of mechanical dimensions. The main challenges to be addressed are low mass, low cost, high power efficiency (i.e., > 40%), and coverage area (i.e., highly steerable). A significant cost reduction for MMIC based arrays is highly desirable. (Typical NRE is ~ $1000.00/element.) Advances in digital beam-forming techniques, including those based on superconducting digital signal processing methods, are also desirable. The expected exit technology readiness level (TRL) is 4. Ground-based Uplink Antenna Array Designs NASA is considering arrays of ground-based antennas to increase capacity and system flexibility, to reduce reliance on large antennas and high operating costs, and eliminate single point of failure of large antennas. A large number of smaller antennas arrayed together results in a scalable, evolvable system which enables a flexible schedule and support for more simultaneous missions. Some concepts currently under consideration are the development of medium-size (12-m class) antennas (hundreds of them are expected to be required) for transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) ground-based arrays. A significant challenge is the implementation of an array for transmitting (uplinking), which may or may not use the same antennas that are used for receiving. The uplink frequency will be in the 7.1-8.6 GHz range (X-band) in the near term, and may be higher frequencies in in the future; it will likely carry digital modulation at rates from 10 kbps to 30 Mbps. An EIRP of at least 500 GW is required, and some applications contemplate an EIRP as high as 10 TW. A major challenges in the uplink array design is minimizing the life-cycle cost of an array. Other challenges for ground-based antennas include the development of low cost, reliable components for critical antenna systems; advanced, ultra-phase-stable electronics, and phase calibration techniques; improved understanding of atmospheric effects on signal coherence; and integrated low-noise receiver-transmitter technology. Phase calibration techniques needed to ensure coherent addition of the signals from individual antennas at the spacecraft are also required. It is important to understand whether space-based techniques are required or ground-based techniques are adequate. In general, a target spacecraft in deep space cannot be used for calibration because of the long round-trip communication delay. Design of ultra-phase-stable electronics to maintain the relative phase among antennas is also needed . These will minimize the need for continuous, extensive and/or disruptive calibrations. A primary related effort currently underway is understanding the effect of the medium (primarily the Earth's troposphere) on the coherence of the signals at the target spacecraft. Generally, turbulence in the medium tends to disrupt the coherence in a way that is time-dependent and site-dependent. A quantitative understanding of these effects is needed. Consequently, techniques for integrating a very low-noise, cryogenically cooled receiver with a medium power (1-200 W) transmitter, are desired . If transmitters and receivers are combined on the same antenna, the performance of each should be compromised as little as possible, and the low cost and high reliability should be maintained. Under the ground-based antenna area, the exit TRL should be greater than or equal to 4. High-Efficiency, Miniature Antennas High efficiency, low-cost, low-weight, miniaturized antennas that are wearable antennas or can be highly integrated into the structure. Example of EVA's space suits made with textile antennas or visor mounted antennas. The antennas may be fractal antennas but also multi-directional to support astronaut mobility, multiband operation and/or broad bandwidth. Antennas should be low/self-powered, small, and efficient, and compatible with communication equipment that can provide high data rate coverage at short ranges (~1.5-3 km, horizon for the Moon for EVA). In-situ low-gain antenna (UHF or X-band) that provide circular polarization with full hemispherical coverage (zenith as well as over the horizon) are desirable. Smart, Reconfigurable Antennas NASA is interested in smart, reconfigurable antennas for applications in lunar and planetary operations. The characteristics to consider include the frequency, polarization, and the radiation pattern. Low-cost approaches are encouraged to reduce the number of antenna apertures needed to meet the requirements associated with lunar and planetary surface exploration (e.g., rovers, pressurized surface vehicles, habitats, etc.). Desirable features include multibeam operation to support connectivity to different communication nodes on lunar and planetary surfaces or in support of communication links for satellite relays around planetary orbits. Also the antenna shall be highly directive, multi-frequency and compatible with Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) concept.The exit TRL should be 4. Large Aperture Inflatable/Deployable Antennas Large deployable or inflatable membrane antennas to significantly reduce stowage volume (packaging efficiencies as high as 50:1), provide high deployment reliability, and significantly reduced mass density (i.e., < 1kg/square meter) are needed. These large Gossamer-like antennas are required to provide high-capacity communication links with low fabrication costs from the Moon/Mars surface to relay satellites or Earth. These membrane antennas are deployed from a small package via some inflation mechanism. Techniques for rigidizing these membrane antennas without the use of gases (e.g., ultraviolet curing), as well as thin-membrane tensioning and support techniques to achieve precision and wrinkle-free surfaces, in particular for applications at Ka-band or higher frequencies is desirable. Novel materials (including memory matrix materials), low fabrication costs and deployment and construction methods using low emissivity materials to enable passive microwave instrument application are also beneficial. Structural health monitoring systems, needed to support pre-flight integration / test activities and determine health of system in-flight, are of interest. The challenge is to generate designs incorporating structural considerations (e.g., aero-braking for deep space planetary missions). Antenna Adaptive Beam Correction with Pointing Control Antenna adaptive beam correction with pointing control that can provide spacecraft knowledge with fine beam pointing with sub-milliradian precision (e.g., < 250 micro-radians) in order to point large spacecraft antennas (e.g., 10-m diameter) in Mars' vicinity is also desirable under this subtopic. The challenges include reduced antenna reflector surface distortions in a space environment; compensation techniques to optimize antenna beam patterns; ground- and space-based methods to monitor spacecraft antenna distortions; and advanced technologies that enable antenna pointing accuracies in the sub-milliradian range for Ka-band spacecraft applications. Methods of dealing with extreme latency (e.g., 20 minutes) in beacon and monopulse systems are of interest. Advances would lead to enhanced space communication links. The resulting developments should be at TRL 4. Size weight and power requirements are of concern. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract. Development Timeline: After a possible Phase 3 development activity, these technologies are expected to ready for insertion at TRL 6 by 2014. Therefore a TRL progression from an entry TRL of 1-2 for Phase 1 in January 2009 followed by an exit TRL of 3 - 4 after Phase 2 is reasonable. Phase 1 Deliverables: A final report containing optimal design for the technology concept including feasibility of concept, a detailed path towards Phase 2 hardware and/or software demonstration. The report shall also provide options for potential Phase 3 funding from other government agencies (OGA). Phase 2 Deliverables: A working proof-of-concept demonstrated and delivered to NASA for testing and verification. The proposer to this subtopic is advised that the products proposed may be included in a future small satellite flight opportunity. Please see the SMD Topic S4 on Small Satellites for details regarding those opportunities. If the proposer would like to have their proposal considered for flight in the small satellite program, the proposal should state such and recommend a pathway for that possibility. Read less>>"
Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.03Reconfigurable/Reprogrammable Communication Systems, GRC," ARC, GSFC, JPL, JSC","NASA seeks novel approaches in reconfigurable, reprogrammable communication systems to enable the vision of Space, Exploration, Science, and Aeronautical Systems. Exploration of Martian and Lunar environments will require advancements in communication systems to manage the demands of the harsh space environment on space electronics, maintain flexibility and adaptability to changing needs and requirements, and provide flexibility and survivability due to increased mission durations. NASA missions can have vastly different transceiver requirements (e.g., 1’s to 10’s Mbps at UHF and S-band frequency bands up to 10’s to 1000’s Mbps at X, and Ka-band frequency bands.) and available resources depending on the science objective, operating environment, and spacecraft resources. For example, deep space missions are often power constrained; operating over large distances, and subsequently have lower data transmission rates when compared to near-Earth or near planetary satellites. These requirements and resource limitations are known prior to launch; therefore, the scalability feature can be used to maximize transceiver efficiency while minimizing resources consumed. Larger platforms such as vehicles or relay spacecraft may provide more resources but may also be expected to perform more complex functions or support multiple and simultaneous communication links to a diverse set of assets. This solicitation seeks advancements in reconfigurable transceiver and associated component technology. The goal of the subtopic is to provide flexible, reconfigurable communications capability while minimizing on-board resources and cost. Topics of interest include the development of software defined radios or radio subsystems which demonstrate reconfigurability, flexibility, reduced power consumption of digital signal processing systems, increased performance and bandwidth, reduced software qualification cost, and error detection and mitigation technologies. Complex reconfigurable systems will provide multiple channel and multiple and simultaneous waveforms. Areas of interest to develop and/or demonstrate are as follows: Advancements in bandwidth capacity, reduced resource consumption, or adherence to the Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) standard and open hardware and software interfaces. Techniques should include fault tolerant, reliable software execution, reprogrammable digital signal processing devices. Reconfigurable software and firmware which provide access control, authentication, and data integrity checks of the reconfiguration process including partial reconfiguration which allows simultaneous operation and upload of new waveforms or functions. Operator or automated reconfiguration or waveform load detection failure and the ability to provide access back to a known, reliable operational state. An automated restore capability ensures the system can revert to a baseline configuration, thereby avoiding permanent communications loss do to an errant reconfiguration process or logic upset. Dynamic or distributed on-board processing architectures to provide reconfigurability and processing capacity. For example, demonstrate technologies to enable a common processing system capacity for communications, science, and health monitoring. Adaptive modulation and waveform recognition techniques are desired to enable transceivers to exchange waveforms with other assets automatically or through ground control. Low overhead, low complexity hardware and software architectures to enable hardware or software component or design reuse (e.g., software portability) that demonstrates cost or time savings. Emphasis should be on the application of open standards architecture to facilitate interoperability among different vendors to minimize the operational impact of upgrading hardware and software components. Software tools or tool chain methodologies to enable both design and software modeling and code reuse and advancements in optimized code generation for digital signal processing systems. The use of reconfigurable logic devices in software defined radios is expected to increase in the future to provide reconfigurability and on-orbit flexibility for waveforms and applications. As the densities of these devices continue to increase and feature size decreases, the susceptibility of the electronics to single event effects also increases. Novel approaches to mitigate single event effects in reconfigurable logic caused by charged particles are sought to improve reliability. New methods should show advancements in reduced cost, power consumption or complexity compared to traditional approaches (i.e., voting schemes and constant updates (i.e., scrubbing)). Techniques and implementations to provide a core capability within the software defined radio in the event of failure or disruption of the primary waveform and/or system hardware. Communication loss should be detected and core capability (e.g., “gold” waveform code) automatically executed to provide access control and restore operation. Innovative solutions to software defined radio implementations that reduce power consumption and mass. Solutions should enable future hardware scalability among different mission classes (e.g., low rate deep space to moderate or high rate near planetary, or relay spacecraft) and should promote modularity and common, open interfaces. In component technology, advancements in analog-to-digital converters or digital-to-analog converters to increase sampling and resolution capabilities, novel techniques to increase memory densities, and advancements in processing and reconfigurable logic technology each reducing power consumption and improving performance in harsh environments. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.04Miniaturized Digital EVA Radio, JSC, GRC,"Lunar outpost surface operations pose unique challenges that demand a compact, power-efficient, and adaptive S-band EVA digital radio with built-in navigation capability. High-performance criteria, tight power constraints, and multi-mode functionality are making mobile terminals increasingly complex. Therefore, NASA needs to advance next-generation digital radio technologies to meet the stringent demands of ultra low power, high reliability, and small form factor. More than a conventional system, the EVA radio infrastructure supports relative navigation, high resolution image processing, voice encoding, networked based IP communications, and dynamic quality of service. By leveraging RF micro-electromechanical system (MEM) components, intelligent middleware, and location aided networking, this solicitation aims to reach TRL 5 by 2012 with breakthrough radio metrics- less than four watts of total power consumption and cell-phone sized form factor. Operating at 2.4-2.483 GHz (S-band), the digital radio must support multiple bandwidth and data transmissions of voice, telemetry, and video- standard as well as high definition- to fixed and mobile assets, including lunar base station, landers, habitat, rovers, and other astronauts. To extend battery life, the EVA digital radio must incorporate middleware that optimizes power needed to maintain link quality. Under harsh lunar environmental conditions, the cognitive middleware must optimally match the QoS requirement, the channel condition, and the interference environment as well as select the mode with the least energy profile for power efficiency. As a result, this EVA radio must dynamically and adaptively conserve power on a packet-by-packet basis. During contingency mode, EVA digital radio will transmit voice and data in half-duplex mode. With novel wireless communication network concepts, the offeror should propose solutions to enable position determination and relative navigation out to a distance of 10km with accuracy of 100 meters (3 sigma). The Phase 1 effort defines an ultra low-power, high-performance, compact digital radio that incorporates innovative components and novel approaches to meet the above requirements for a single fault tolerant architecture. To achieve dramatic reductions in power and volume, solutions must exploit MEMS for cell phones and handheld (e.g., MEM filters, tunable matching elements, etc.) and other advanced analog/digital components, advanced digital signal processing, as well as next-generation processing elements such as FPGAs and multi-core processors. Moreover, one must select a promising modular candidate architecture for the above requirements, exploiting emerging commercial wireless network technologies such as WLAN and WWAN. This encompasses identifying transceiver hardware, firmware, and all platform integration issues. For this solicitation, one can assume EVA digital radio will be part of a mobile ad hoc network infrastructure that is self-configuring, self-discovering, and self-healing. Where all nodes can act as routers for other low power mobile nodes and network coverage has no limit for wireless communications. In other words, the diameter of the network can be increased by adding more nodes. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract. Phase 1 Deliverables: Conduct design tradeoffs between power, performance, and flexibility. Estimate mass, volume, power, max/min range, and data rates for dynamic quality of service (voice, telemetry, video) standard and high definition TV at S-band (2.4 - 2.483 GHz), backed with analyses including lunar propagation effects and comprehensive simulations to ensure achievable performance and power goals. Consider IP voice as an optional feature. As a prerequisite to Phase 2, one must select a promising architecture that balances ultra low power, mass, size, performance, functionality, and reliability. In fact, the offeror must demonstrate the ability to achieve significant advantages in compactness over a non-MEMS approach and address power efficiency and reliability. Special interests include single-chip design/packaging and integrated circuit-level implemenation of RF MEMS. Propose a preliminary design approach for the next-generation digital EVA radio, leveraging commercial multimedia cellular and WLAN technology. Operating at S-band (2.4- 2.483 GHz), MEM filters should be considered to achieve low power consumption and compact, cell-phone sized form factor. Determine the suitability and usage of ultra low power digital devices, compact RF systems, and novel configurations when recommending candidate architectures. For the middleware, conduct trade-offs and identify the set of required parameters for the ideal radio. Quantify performance in terms of energy savings and the ability to maximize connectivity and throughput in an ad hoc network. Develop communications and 3D navigation tracking ad hoc network concepts and algorithms that validate the feasibility of the approach. Without GPS, integrated low-power communication and navigation surface assets must track, locate, and identify tagging assets with multiple routes over an operational range of 10 km, even if astronauts descend into craters. Assume the availability of digital terrain maps. Consider low-power approaches that exploit bread crumbs, active/passive RFID systems for ID, position, sensing, etc and expand investigation to modulated retroreflectors based upon MEMS technology or solar-powered beacons. Simulate the performance of a robust integrated communications and navigation network architecture and conduct preliminary sensitivity analysis for parameterization of the selected implementation strategy. Specifically, describe the division of functionalities between the various components (fixed and mobile) as well as segments (inter-vehicle and mobile-to-fixed node on planetary surface as well as surface-to-orbit (lunar relay satellites). Phase 2 Deliverables: Demonstrate RF performance and total power consumption of less than four watts, delivering voice, telemetry, and standard and high-definition video motion imagery at 2.4- 2.483 GHz (S-band). Within power budget allocation, verify performance and reliability for multiple bandwidth and data transmissions of telemetry, voice, and high-rate video. Develop a reliable, intelligent, and power-efficient EVA digital radio prototype unit and demonstrate robust power management and optimization feasibility of the Phase 2 middleware and ad hoc network approach. Explore radiometric tracking techniques and benefits from location-aided networking to support (limited) relative navigation using an ad hoc network infrastructure during EVA walkback. Moreover, a simulation capability must demonstrate node discovery, location awareness, and route re-configurability as nodes enter and leave the network. Testing will be conducted at an approved site and should comprise of a variety of nodes (fixed and mobile) as well as a suite of applications (non-real time data as well as real-time voice and video). Develop and demonstrate a working ad hoc network prototype that allows characterization of the following metrics in a static deployment: a) network range, b) aggregate throughput and throughput per user, and c) node and network lifetime. Deliver open middleware and supporting IP solutions. Where costs preclude full implementation of all component technologies, provide analysis to extrapolate the performance of a complete design. Commercial Potential: Adaptive radios potentially offer significant cost savings to a wide spectrum of commercial markets including telecommunications and consumer electronics. They also provide for enhanced interoperability and spectrum reuse for Homeland Security applications. New component technologies and radio infrastructures are needed to extend the programmable capabilities into long battery life handsets. Read less>>"
Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.05Communication for Space-Based Range, GSFC," ARC, GRC","Space-Based Telemetry Transceivers may replace Line-of-Sight (LOS) and RADAR based Tracking, Telemetry, and Command (TT&C) flight and ground systems for sub-orbital platforms and orbit-insertion launch vehicles. In order to do so, the transceivers must be capable of providing real-time or near real-time return (data) and forward (command) links of varying bandwidths with industry accepted Quality of Service (QoS) levels. Some applications require the coupling of embedded GPS receivers and attitude determination units, while others require high bandwidth links with common interfaces (i.e., Ethernet). In all cases it is desired to utilize an existing commercial satellite provider with fee-for-service to reduce operating and overhead expenses. Note: The proposer should be aware of subtopic O4.01, which seeks advancements in GPS metric tracking. This proposal primarily focuses on space-based transceivers. However, advancements made under O4.01 could be incorporated with space-based transceivers in the future. Purpose The vision of Space-Based Range architecture is to assure public safety, reduce the costs of launch operations, enable multiple simultaneous launch operations, decrease response time, and improve geographic and temporal flexibility. It is desired to reduce or eliminate the need for redundant range assets and deployed down-range assets that are currently used to provide for LOS TT&C with sub-orbital platforms and orbit-insertion launch vehicles. This solicitation seeks to achieve this by focusing on specific needed advancements in TT&C. There are varying applications for space-based transceivers, each necessitating a different set of requirements. Low data rate and very low cost transceivers coupled with highly accurate GPS receivers may be used to measure wind velocities to determine flight conditions and accurate trajectory predictions. These could also be used to track low risk payload or vehicle components for recovery purposes. Higher dynamic vehicles require a more robust transceiver with embedded position and attitude determination units to track vehicle trajectories through space insertion or for recovery purposes. High data rate transceivers with a commonly used interface could be used across multiple platforms for primary or redundant data dispersion and command control. The proposer should address one of the following three need areas below: Low Cost and Low SWAP Transceiver with Integrated GPS Receiver Core Capabilities should include: Utilize existing commercial satellite provider with fee for service.

Highly accurate GPS solutions. Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) embedded units may be utilized but repackaging may be needed to provide a single, integrated Over-the-Horizon (OTH) tracker. Independent Kalman Filtering techniques may need to be developed. Velocity jitter is highly undesirable. The ability to lift altitude and velocity (COCOM) restrictions is needed.

Highly accurate integrated position and solid-state attitude solutions. COTS units may be utilized but repackaging may be needed to provide a single integrated OTH tracker. The ability to lift altitude and velocity (COCOM) restrictions is needed. Environmental considerations: Operability from sea level up to space insertion is desired (note that radiation hardening is not required). Operating temperatures of -20°C to +60°C are needed. Ability to operate on spin stabilized rockets (up to 7 rps), under sudden acceleration, and under high jerk environments (e.g., launch conditions and separation / jettison events). Duration of mission operation is several hours. Ground Software to view the telemetered data. Optional Capabilities: The ability to operate at all latitudes.

Open source or factory customizable firmware. High Data Rate Transceiver Core Capabilities should include: Utilize existing commercial satellite provider with fee for service. Limit the user burden to provide adequate EIRP for providing acceptable link margins. Cost and SWAP commensurate with performance, but all should be kept minimal. Ability to operate up to +/- 70 deg latitude (all latitudes preferred). The minimum return bandwidth (data) is 50 kbps but several hundred kbps is desired. The minimum forward bandwidth (command) is 1 kbps but several kbps is desired.

Ability to receive commands with very low latency (preferably sub-second) and little to no loss from an IP based ground terminal. Ability to receive data and send commands from one location anywhere in the world via IP. However, an RF link could be used as a backup for remote locations. The transceiver I/O interface should allow for easy interfacing to multiple platforms. An Ethernet interface is preferred, but lower data rates may allow for an asynchronous serial interface. Depending on the satellite platform chosen, the proposer may have to provide internal buffering and clocking mechanisms to smooth an asynchronous input for proper ground receipt. Environmental considerations: Operability from sea level up to space insertion is desired (note that radiation hardening is not required). Operating temperatures of -20°C to +60°C are needed. The initial prototype could be tested on low dynamics vehicles, thereby concentrating the focus on performance. However, the ultimate goal is the ability to operate on spin stabilized rockets (up to 7 rps), under sudden acceleration, and under high jerk environments (e.g., launch conditions and separation / jettison events). Duration of mission operation is several minutes to several months. Ground Software to view the telemetered data. Optional Capabilities: The ability to operate at all latitudes. Operating temperatures of -40°C to +85°C. Ability to receive data at multiple locations simultaneously via IP. Open source or factory customizable firmware. In all cases, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract. The proposer to this subtopic is advised that the products proposed may be included in a future small satellite flight opportunity.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.08Lunar Surface Communication Networks and Orbit Access Links, GRC," ARC, GSFC, JPL, JSC","This solicitation seeks to develop a highly robust, bidirectional, and disruption-tolerant communications network for the lunar surface and lunar orbital access links. Exploration of lunar and planetary surfaces will require short-range (~1.6 km line-of sight, ~5.6 km non-line-of-sight) bi-directional, and robust multiple point links to provide on-demand, disruption and delay-tolerant, and autonomous interconnection among surface-based assets. Some of the nodes will be fixed, such as base stations and relays to orbital assets, and some transportable, such as rovers and humans. The ability to meet the demanding environment presented by lunar and planetary surfaces will encompass the development and integration of a number of communication and networking technologies and protocols. NASA lunar surface networks will be dynamic in nature, and required to deliver multiple data flows with different priorities (operational voice, command/control, telemetry, various qualities of video flows, and others). Bandwidth and power efficient approaches to mobile ad hoc networks are desired. Quality of Service (QoS) algorithms in a Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) setting will need to be developed and tailored to NASA mission specific needs and for the lunar surface environment. These lunar and planetary surface networks will need to seamlessly interface with communications access terminals and orbiting relays that also can provide autonomous connectivity to Earth based assets. The access link communications system will encompass the development and integration of a number of communications and networking technologies and protocols to meet the stringent demands of continuous interoperable communications. Human exploration, therefore, requires the development of innovative communication protocols that exploit persistent storage on mobile and stationary nodes to ensure timely and reliable delivery of data even when no stable end-to-end paths exist. Solutions must exploit stability when it exists to nearly approximate the performance of conventional MANET protocols. The lunar surface communications network must support 15 simultaneous users with aggregate bandwidth of 80 Mbps. It must also support minimum data rates of 16 kbps and maximum data rates of 20 Mbps and be IP compatible with a BER of 10e-8 or less, and graceful degradation.

To meet the schedule for NASA’s Vision for Space Exploration (VSE), a TRL progression from an entry TRL of 1-2 for Phase 1 in January 2009 followed by an exit TRL of 3 - 4 after Phase 2 is required. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract. Phase 1 Deliverables: Propose a robust lunar surface and orbit access communications network suitable for the applications and environment.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.09Software for Space Communications Infrastructure Operations, JPL," ARC, GRC, GSFC","New technology is sought to improve resource optimization and the user interface of planning and scheduling tools for NASA's Space Communications Infrastructure. The software created should have a commercialization approach with the new modules fitting into an existing or in development planning and scheduling tool. Purpose (based on NASA needs) and the current state of the art: The current infrastructure for NASA Space Communications provides services for near-Earth spacecraft and deep space planetary missions. The infrastructure assets include the Deep Space Network (DSN), the Ground Network (GN), and the Space Network (SN). Recent planning for the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) for human exploration to the Moon and beyond as well as maintaining vibrant space and Earth science programs resulted in a new concept of the communications architecture. The future communications architecture will evolve from the present legacy assets and with addition of new assets. NASA seeks automation technologies that will facilitate scheduling of oversubscribed communications resources to support: (1) Increased numbers of missions and customers; (2) Increased number and complexity of constraints (as required by new antenna types); and (3) decreased operations budgets (both core communications network operations and mission side operations budgets. Core Capabilities: Intelligent AssistantsIn order to automate the user's provision of requirements and refinement of the schedule, ""intelligent assistant"" software should manage the user interface. Assistants should streamline access and modification of requirement and schedule information. By modeling the user, this software can adjust the level of autonomy enabling decisions to be made by the user or the automated system. Assistants should try to minimize user involvement without making decisions the user would prefer to make. The assistants should adapt to the user by learning their control preferences. This technology should apply to local/centralized and collaborative scheduling. In a conflict-aware scheduling system (especially in a collaborative scheduling environment), conflicts are prevalent. With the concept of one big schedule from the beginning of time, real time, to the end of time, resolving conflicts become a difficult task especially since resolving conflicts in a local sense may affect the global schedule. Therefore, an intelligent assistant may provide decision support to the system or the users to assist conflict resolution. This may involve a set of rules combining with certain local/global optimization to generate a list of options for the system or users to choose from. Resource OptimizationThe goal of schedule optimization is to produce allocations that yield the best objectives. These may include maximizing DSN utilization, minimizing loss of desired tracking time, and optimizing project satisfaction. Each project may have their own definition of satisfaction such as maximal science data returned, maximal tracking time,best allocation of the day/week, etc. The difficulty is that we may not satisfy all of these objectives during the optimization process. Obviously, optimal solution for one objective may produce worse results for the other objectives. One possible solution is to map all of these objectives to an overall system goal. This mapping is normally non-linear. Technology needs to be developed for this non-linear mapping for scoring in addition to regular optimization approaches. Optional Capabilities: Multiple AgentsIn an environment where all system variables can be controlled by a single controller, an optimal solution for the objective function can be achieved by finding the right set of variables. In a collaborative environment with multiple decision makers where each decision maker can only control a subset of the variables, modeling and optimization become a very complex issue. In the proposed collaborative scheduling approach, there are many users/agents that will control their own allocations with interaction with the others. How we model their interactions and define system policy so the interaction can achieve the overall system goal is an important topic. The approach for multiple decision-maker collaboration has been studied in the area of Game Theory. The applications cover many areas including economics and engineering. The major solutions include Pareto, Nash, and Stackelberg. There are many new research areas including incentive control, collaborative control, Ordinal Games, etc. Note that intelligent assistants and multiple agents represent different points on the spectrum of automation. Current operations utilize primarily manual collaborative scheduling, intelligent assistants would enhance users ability to participate in this process and intelligent agents could more automate individual customers scheduling. Ideally, proposed intelligent assistants and distributed agents would also be able to represent customers who do not wish to expose their general preferences and constraints. A start for reference material on this subtopic may be found at the following: http://ai.jpl.nasa.gov in the publications area; http://scp.gsfc.nasa.gov/gn/gnusersguide3.pdf, NASA Ground Network User’s Guide, Chapter 9 Scheduling; andhttp://scp.gsfc.nasa.gov/tdrss/guide.html, Space Network User's Guide, SpaceOps Conference Proceedings.

Space Operations,Topic O2 Space Transportation ,O2.01Automated Collection and Transfer of Launch Range Surveillance/Intrusion Data, KSC," GSFC, MSFC","NASA is seeking innovative technologies for sensors and instrumentation technologies which expedite range clearance by providing real-time situational awareness for safe Range operations from processing to launch and recovery. These sensors and instruments are expected to operate, as a payload, on mobile or deployable Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), High Altitude Airships (HAA), buoys, etc. Purpose: NASA is embarking on a new era of space exploration with new launch vehicles and demands for availability to support launch times within hours of one another to ensure mission success. This availability requirement is allocated across the entire launch operations which includes the Range that provides clear corridor of land, air and sea for the vehicles to transit through, as they ascent or return. The current Range infrastructure is aging, labor intensive and independent, and would benefit from new sensors and instrumentation that improve the situational awareness to those that are responsible for ensuring public safety, mission assurance and efficient operations. To aid in this situational awareness the new sensors and instrumentation must be able to operate in the environment that takes advantage of mobile or deployable Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), High Altitude Airships (HAA), buoys, etc. Use of these vehicles as a platform is intended to increase the Ranges availability while reducing the cost of operations. Size, power, weight and stability of these systems, that operate on these platforms, will be a major constraint their use. These sensors and instrumentation provide for the remote detection, recognition, and identification of persons and objects that have intruded into areas of the range that must be cleared in order to conduct safe launch operations. This would include a wide spectrum of optical, infrared, Radio Frequency (RF), and millimeter wave sensors for this purpose. In order to achieve accurate identification, time and position of intruding entities multiple sensors and instruments may be used, or combined through the use of neural networks and data fusion techniques. This will require the use of standards for communications, so that, data from individual sensors or instruments can be combined on a platform and processed on-board, or communicated to central location where a fused solution is processed. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward a Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract.

Space Operations,Topic O3 Processing and Operations ,O3.01Crew Health and Safety Including Medical Operations, JSC," ARC, GRC","Determining the probability of certain types of events (such as medical conditions) can be tricky. Often there is not enough space-flight data to make a good determination and so other types of evidence are used such as expert opinion, analog data, controlled studies, etc. Each source of evidence must be documented (e.g., as a publication citation, or as a data pull against some data source along with the query parameters used). The source is also characterized as to its “level of evidence” using the Cochrane methodology as documented in the National Guideline Clearinghouse (http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?doc_id4913(link is external)). There are many methods for combining these evidence pieces. A software system is sought that can be used to collect the evidence (references to evidence sources such as journal publications, population statistics, analog study, etc.) and which facilitates the evidence level assignment (providing a place to record the evidence level and definitions of each level). Furthermore the system should provide a model for combining these evidence sources in a principled manner that characterizes the certainty of the conclusion reached, e.g., a weighted equation where the weights may be adjusted by the users of the system. Relevance: Evidence of events drives risk assessment. Depending on the risks identified, decisions can be made as to whether to mitigate the risk via pre-flight activities or in-flight capabilities. Such a system supports “what would happen if” type reasoning that enables exploration of different mission options. Challenge Addressed: Capturing the evidence base in one place along with additional categorization (level of evidence, uncertainty, quality of evidence, etc.) is invaluable in preserving decision-making rationale such that the decisions can be revisited if additional evidence/information is added later. Determining where to spend limited resources wisely is supported – e.g., balance funding between development of pre-flight mitigation strategies, in-flight capability development, investigation of knowledge gaps (uncertainties), and risk acceptance decisions. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract.

Space Operations,Topic O3 Processing and Operations ,O3.02Human interface systems and technologies for spacesuits, GRC," ARC, JSC, KSC","The primary medium for sending and receiving information from a crewmember is two-way voice communications. The function of the voice communications system may be extended to include data entry through the inclusion of a Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Recent developments in ASR have lead to systems that are capable of connected word identification or speaker-independent word identification. These systems rely on very high fidelity audio link to the talker’s speech. While speech recognition technology has enjoyed significant advances in recent decades, alternate technologies for data entry exist. Such systems may enjoy advantages over speech recognition for the spacesuit application in areas such as overall Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) or system robustness. The focus of this subtopic is on the development of systems and technologies in support of high fidelity speech and data entry for space suits. In addition to providing the necessary audio fidelity for ASR, the high fidelity audio systems also result in better voice communications for human-to-human communications. The topic therefore includes the related areas of inbound audio systems and hearing protection systems. High Fidelity, In-Helmet Audio Systems The space suit environment presents a unique challenge for capturing and transmitting speech communications to and from an crewmember. The in-suit acoustic environment is characterized by highly reflective surfaces, causing high levels of reverberation, as well as spacesuit-unique noise fields. Known sources of noise within the suit are both stationary and transient in nature. Noise within the suit can be acoustically borne or it can originate from structure-borne vibration. Noise originates from suit machinery, footfalls, suit arm and hip bearing, body movement noise and turbulent flow noise from devices such as oxygen spray bars and breath noise. Static pressure levels within the spacesuit can range from a small fraction of an atmosphere during Extravehicular Activity (EVA) operations to strong hyperbaric conditions that exist during terrestrial field-testing. These changes in static pressure level have significant effects on acoustic transduction. Additionally, in some spacesuits, the crewmember is afforded a wide range of motion within the torso of the suit. The wide range of motion means that the acoustic path between an crewmember’s mouth or ear and the microphone or helmet mounted speaker varies significantly with movement, resulting in decreased sound pressure levels at the microphone and/or increased interference from competing background noise sources. In addition, vehicular operations can generate high levels of noise that are not fully attenuated by the spacesuit, helmet or headsets. Due to these factors, the quality of speech delivered to and from the inside of a spacesuit helmet can be low and can have a negative effect on inbound and outbound speech intelligibility and the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. The traditional approach to overcome the challenges of the spacesuit acoustic environment is to use a skullcap-based system of microphones and speakers. Cap-based solutions mitigate many of the acoustic problems associated with in-helmet communications systems through the very short and direct acoustic transmission paths between the crewmember and the speakers and microphones. The skullcap’s headsets and noise canceling microphones can also afford some degree of acoustic isolation for the crewmember from noise generated inside the spacesuit. Cap-based systems are less successful, however, in attenuating high noise levels generated outside the spacesuit (e.g., during launch, descent, burn activities, or emergency aborts), even when coupled with the launch/entry helmet. The use of noise canceling microphones can improve speech intelligibility, but only if the microphones are in close proximity to the crewmember’s mouth. Many logistical issues exist for head-mounted caps. Crewmembers are not able to adjust the skullcap, headset or microphone booms during EVA operations (which can last from four to eight hours) or during launch/entry operations. Interference between the protuberances of the cap and other devices such as drinking/feeding tubes is a recognized issue during EVA. Comfort, hygiene, proper positioning and dislocation are major concerns for head-mounted caps. Wire fatigue and blind mating of the connectors are also problems with the cap-based systems. In order to accommodate anthropometric variations in crew heads, multiple cap sizes are required. Issues have recently been identified with existing communications systems regarding adjustment of microphone boom lengths, proper function over the wide ranges of static pressure experienced during suited operations, flow noise over the microphone elements, and integration with advanced helmet designs. NASA is seeking systems, subsystems and/or technologies in support of improvements in speech intelligibility, speech quality, listening quality and listening effort for in-helmet aural and vocal communications. In addition, improvements in hearing protection are sought to protect the crew during all mission phases, in case hazardous acoustic levels and conditions occur. The specific focus of this SBIR subtopic is on improving the interface between crewmember and the acoustic pickup (i.e., microphones) and generation (i.e., speaker) systems. Systems and devices are sought to improve or resolve acoustic, physical and technical problems (listed above) that have been associated with skullcap-mounted speakers and microphones, or allow for the elimination of skullcap-mounted speakers and microphones. In particular, voice communications systems are sought that have provided crewmembers with adequate speech intelligibility over background noise within, and external to, the spacesuit. Overall system performance must provide Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for Listening Quality (Lq) and Listening Effort (Le) of 3.9 or greater, or Articulation Index (AI) of .7 or better or 90% Speech Intelligibility (SI) in the crewmember’s native language for both inbound and outbound speech communication. Specific technologies of interest include, but are not limited to: Acoustic modeling of the in-suit acoustic environment, including the ability to model structure-borne vibration in helmet and suit structures as well as transduction to and from the acoustic medium. Low-mass, low-volume, low-distortion, space-qualified speakers with low variation in sensitivity with static pressure. Changes in speaker sensitivity should be less than 2 dB over the speech band with changes in static pressure between 3 and 18 psia. Low-mass, low-volume, low-distortion high-sensitivity (> 5 mV/Pa), space-qualified noise canceling microphones with low variation in sensitivity with static pressure. Changes in microphone sensitivity should be less than 2 dB over the speech band with changes in static pressure between 3 and 18 psia. Attenuation of external noise by passive hearing protection that is comfortable for crewmembers during extended use. Development of theories, experiments and analysis in support of decomposition of end-to-end SI and/or MOS requirements to the spacesuit portion of EVA-to-Mission Operations Center (MOC), EVA-to-EVA or EVA-to-habitat voice loops. Comparison of SI system fidelity metrics to MOS system fidelity metrics. In-helmet devices will need to be compatible with high humidity, low humidity and pure oxygen environments. Devices should be able to fit a wide anthropometric range of head and physical features found within the astronaut corps. Additionally, demonstrations of novel system concepts for in-helmet audio communication are of strong interest. A partial list of such concepts includes: Near-field beamforming systems; Optical microphone systems; Highly directive sound production systems such as parametric sound systems; Active noise cancellation systems for hearing protection; Bone conduction microphones. Systems and devices must include appropriate computer processing systems. The expectation is that a working and fully functional system or device will be delivered at the end of Phase 2. Advanced Data/Text Entry for Spacesuits The space suit environment presents a unique and challenging environment for control of suit-mounted processing equipment. Terrestrial user-interface devices for controlling portable processing equipment such as laptop computers typically rely on keyboard or touchpad input. Such devices are problematic in the space environment since a suited crewmember must interact with the processing equipment while wearing a pressurized glove. Speech recognition technologies have been proposed and investigated to provide user input, but alternative methods are also desired. Currently, a suit’s processing system has been primarily for providing life-support data-acquisition, monitoring, telemetry, and crewmember alerts. The traditional approach to interact with the EVA processing system is with suit-mounted toggle switches optimally sized for a gloved hand and located in the suit’s chest area. NASA envisions future generations of suits to contain advanced communication, navigation, and information processing capabilities that will require better ways of interacting with the suited crewmember. It is likely that the processing unit(s) will be installed within the suit’s backpack-mounted portable life support unit or in close proximity. Crewmember usability and efficient operation are prime features of the next-generation input device. The device must operate robustly in the space and lunar environment and be tolerant of dust, vacuum, and radiation exposure. During Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA), a suited crewmember needs to achieve as high a level of mobility as possible, so a suit-mounted computer-input device must not impede the movements of the suited crewmember or unduly burden the suit system with weight, volume, or electrical power constraints. NASA is seeking systems, subsystems and/or technologies in support of improvements in suit-mounted computer system user-interface devices. Particular interest is in areas allowing the suited crewmember to control a computer processing system and provide text input accurately, at high speed, without little or no user fatigue for purposes such as note taking or control of the computer display screen. Possible approaches include chording keyboards, suit or glove mounted fabric keyboards or touch-pads or other technologies. Other technologies will also be considered. Concepts may consider both solutions installed internally (within the pure-oxygen pressurized envelop of the suit), externally (mounted on the exterior of the suit), or a combination of the two. Techniques for routing wires or connections between the user interface device and the computer processing unit are also of interest. Techniques for routing the wires past bearings or avoidance of such will be considered. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract.

Space Operations,Topic O4 Navigation ,O4.01Metric Tracking of Launch Vehicles, KSC," GSFC, MSFC","Range Safety requires accurate and reliable tracking data for launch vehicles. Onboard GPS receivers must maintain lock, reacquire very quickly and operate securely in a highly-dynamic environment. GPS Course Acquisition Code (CA) does not require classified decryption codes and has an accuracy of better than 30 m and 1 m/s. Although this accuracy is good enough for most Range Safety needs, better accuracy is needed for antenna pointing, docking maneuvers and attitude determination. CA code also offers little protection against deliberately transmitted false signals or “spoofing”. This solicitation seeks proposals in the following areas: Innovative technologies to increase the accuracy of the L1 C/A navigation solution by combining the pseudoranges and phases of the L1 C/A signals. Factors that degrade the GPS signal can be obtained by differencing the available carrier phase and pseudorange measurements and then removing this difference from the navigation solution. Technologies that combine spatial processing of signals from multiple antennas with temporal processing techniques to mitigate interference signals received by the GPS receiver. The coordinated response of adaptive pattern control (beam and null steering) and digital excision of certain interfering signal components minimizes strong jamming signals. Adaptive nulling minimizes interfering signals by the optimal control of the GPS antenna pattern (null steering). These technologies should be independent of any particular GPS receiver design.

Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1, and show a path toward a Phase 2 hardware and/or software demonstration of a demonstration unit or software package that will be delivered to NASA for testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract.

Offerors are encouraged to take this in consideration as a possible flight opportunity when proposing work to this subtopic. Purpose: NASA Needs vs. Current State of the ArtThis solicitation is primarily focused on NASA’s needs in three focused areas: onboard near-Earth navigation systems; onboard deep-space navigation systems; technologies supporting improved TDRSS-based navigation. Proposals that leverage state-of-the-art capabilities already developed by NASA such as GEONS (http://techtransfer.gsfc.nasa.gov/ft-tech-GEONS.html), Navigator (http://techtransfer.gsfc.nasa.gov/ft-tech-GPS-NAVIGATOR.html), GIPSY, Electra, and Blackjack are especially encouraged. NASA is not interested in funding efforts that seek to “re-invent the wheel” by duplicating the many investments that NASA and others have already made in establishing the current state-of-the-art.

The augmentation message should include information on the TDRS orbits, status, and health that could be provided by future TDRS, and should provide information on the GPS constellation that is based on NASA’s TDRSS Augmentation for Satellites Signal (TASS). Proposers are advised that NASA’s GEONS and GIPSY orbit determination software packages already support the capability to ingest TASS messages. Onboard Deep-Space Navigation SystemNASA seeks proposals that would develop an onboard autonomous navigation and time-transfer system that can reduce DSN tracking requirements.

Space Operations,Topic O4 Navigation ,O4.03Lunar Surface Navigation, GRC, JSC,"In order to provide location awareness, precision position fixing, best heading and traverse path planning for planetary EVA, manned rovers and lunar surface mobility units NASA has established requirements for organic navigation capabilities for surface-mobile elements of lunar missions. This topic will develop systems, technologies and analysis in support of the required capabilities of lunar surface mobility elements. Contemplated navigation systems could employ celestial references, passive or active optical information such as optical flow or range to local terrain features, inertial sensor information or other location-specific sensed data or combinations thereof. However, radiometric measurements are considered to be concomitant to the lunar communications network and the lunar network will likely be used to communicate state information between lunar mission elements. As such, the main emphasis of this topic is on systems that exploit radiometric measurements such as range, Doppler or Angle of Arrival. Radiometric measurements can be considered between lunar mission elements such as surface mobility units, elements of a lunar surface architecture (such as surface landers or habitation units or other surface mobility units) or elements of the lunar communications and navigation infrastructure such as surface communications towers or lunar communication/navigation orbiters. Earth-based nodes are not excluded from consideration, nor are two-way radiometric measurements, nor are non-NASA-standard (e.g. UWB) modulation schemes. Traverse-path planning systems and navigation-specific displays are also of interest. Emphasis of the development is on navigation accuracy, Size Weight and Power (SWaP), systems that operate effectively with minimal communications/navigation infrastructure (such as towers or orbiters) or with complete autonomy, with minimal crew involvement or completely automatically. Unified concepts and systems that provide a range of hardware capabilities (possibly trading accuracy with SWaP) are of interest. Mature system concepts and technologies including system demonstration with TRL 6 components and internalized (by NASA) standards are required at the end of a Phase 2.

Space Operations,Topic O4 Navigation ,O4.04Timing, JSC," GRC, GSFC, JPL","One of the most critical components of robust relative navigation is accurate and reliable timing across the entire sensor suite. Clock errors, drift, and drift rates must be estimated and corrected. During extended duration operations small clock errors propagated from measurement to measurement can contribute to continued growth in positional errors. Improved timing estimation and reliability within a general navigation clocking system will improve navigational accuracy. Purpose: This solicitation aims to develop two unique timing systems. The first timing system (TS) is for a relative navigation sensor suite to be utilized during lunar surface navigation that will utilize multiple sensors at different times. The sensor suite may include a star tracker, inertial measurement unit, vision-based feature recognition sensor, and RFID tag ranging devices. The TS will take an accurate time input from the primary base station at irregular intervals and a less accurate clock at periodic intervals from a software defined communications radio. The TS should, in an FPGA only, produce a clock signal suitable for time stamping and a clock pulse for four navigation sensors. This generated clock should be accurate to within 1ms of the base station input clock over a period of five minutes between primary clock inputs. Additionally, clock error, drift, and drift rates of the two input clocks and four output timing streams (time stamp and clock pulse) should be made available for analysis. The second timing system is for proposals that improve timing standards. NASA seeks proposals that would improve accuracy for both ground-based tracking networks and onboard navigation systems by providing time and frequency standards that exceed the long-term performance of the GPS Block IIR Rb clocks (for ground-based applications) and current flight USO performance and also for tracking networks at ground-based locations. Timing accuracy is of the utmost importance for this TS; however, size, weight, and power consumption are still considerations. The goal of this TS is to improve the timing and frequency standards and, if possible, exceed the long-term performance of the GPS Block IIR Rb clocks in the ground-based application. Core capabilities: Provide an accurate and self correcting time source suitable for use in a navigation system suite consisting of multiple sensors. The TS clock and time stamp output should be independently adjustable to the needs of the sensors. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration, delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract. Phase 1 Deliverables: A trade study on industry standard timing systems with a focus on overall accuracy and drift performance; Report on the tools and systems currently available; Recommendations on furthering the state-of-the-art in timing performance. Phase 2 Deliverables: Demonstration of implemented timing system given the necessary inputs; Written report and presentation detailing the system performance including electrical and electronic characteristics; Delivery of the timing system and the environment used during development; Delivery of timing system math models for real-time simulation.

Proposals are sought for the development of moisture-resistant resins and new surface treatments/primers. Novel chemistries are sought to improve the durability of aerospace adhesives with potential use on subsonic aircraft. This research opportunity is focused on the development of novel chemistries for coupling agents, surface treatments for adherends and their interfaces, leading to aerospace structural adhesives with improved durability.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.02Sensing and Diagnostic Capability for Aircraft Aging and Damage, LaRC," ARC, GRC","Many conventional nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques have been used for flaw detection, but have shown little potential for much broader application. One element in NASA's contribution to solving the problem of aging and damage processes in future vehicles is research to identify changes in fundamental material properties as indicators of material aging-related hazards before they become critical. Degraded and failing fiber composites can exhibit a number of micromechanisms such as fiber buckling and breakage, matrix cracking, and delamination. In order to provide early detection of these processes and hazards, new sensing and diagnostic capabilities to support nondestructive evaluation (NDE) systems are needed, as well as associated computational techniques and maintenance methods. 'Virtual' inspection methods are being sought for composite materials. 'Virtual' inspections would include modeling the changes in critical material properties as indicators of material aging and then quantifying the levels of detectability of these material properties with a particular NDE technique. This computational tool should accurately model the interaction between the changes in the material properties and the probing energy of a particular NDE technique to allow the development of the inspection parameters needed for application on a particular structure. Actual NDE technologies are also being sought for the nondestructive characterization of age-related degradation in complex composite materials. Innovative and novel approaches to using NDE technologies to measure properties related to material aging (i.e. thermal diffusivity, elastic constants, density, microcrack formation, fiber buckling and breakage etc.) in complex composite material systems, adhesively bonded/built-up and/or polymer-matrix composite sandwich structures. The anticipated outcome of successful proposals would be a both Phase 2 prototype NDE technology for the use of the developed technique to characterize age-related degradation and a demonstration of the technology showing its ability to measure a relevant material property in a carbon fiber/epoxy composite used for structural applications on subsonic aircraft.

To support this predictive capability, structural integrity analytical tools, lifing methods, and material durability prediction tools are being developed. Physics-based and continuum-based models, computational methods, and validation techniques are needed to provide the basis for these higher level (e.g., design) tools. Proposals are sought that apply innovative methods, models and analytic tools to the following specific applications:Probabilistic models are sought for improved structural analysis of complex metallic and composite airframe components. The methods used for these solutions need to detail the initiation and progression of damage to determine accurate estimates of residual life and/or strength of complex airframe structures. Tools and models are needed to predict the onset and rates of type-II hot corrosion attack in nickel-based turbine disk superalloys that allow for prolonged disk operation at high temperatures. Typically hot corrosion of turbine alloys is a product of molten salt exposure and is manifested by a localized pitting corrosion attack. Prolonged high temperature exposures of turbine disk alloys to sulfur-rich low temperature melting eutectic salts can lead to an onset of Type II hot corrosion attack causing serious degradation to the durability of the turbine components. Computational methods are sought to simulate of the response of advanced composite fan case/containment structures in aged conditions to jet engine fan blade-out events using impact mechanics and structural system dynamics modeling techniques.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.04Aviation External Hazard Sensor Technologies, LaRC," ARC, GRC","NASA is concerned with new and innovative methods for airborne detection, identification, evaluation, and monitoring of in-flight hazards to aviation. NASA seeks to foster research and development that leads to innovative new technologies and methods, or significant improvements in existing technologies, for in-flight hazard avoidance and mitigation. Technologies may take the form of tools, models, techniques, procedures, substantiated guidelines, prototypes, and devices. A key objective of the NASA Aviation Safety Program is to support the research of technology, systems, and methods that will facilitate transformation of the National Airspace System to Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) (information available at www.jpdo.gov(link is external)). The general approach to the development of airborne sensors for NextGen is to encourage the development of multi-use, adaptable sensors. The greatest impact will result from improved sensing capability in the terminal area, where higher density and more reliable operations are needed. Under this subtopic, proposals are invited that explore new and improved airborne sensors and sensor systems for the detection and monitoring of hazards to aircraft. This subtopic solicits technology that is focused on developing capabilities to detect and evaluate hazards. The development of human interfaces, including displays and alerts, is not within the scope of this subtopic. In some cases the development of ground-based sensor technology may be supported as a precursor to eventual airborne applications. At this time, the following hazards are of particular interest: in-flight icing conditions and wake vortices. Proposals associated with sensor investigations addressing these hazards are encouraged, and some suggestions follow. To enable remote detection and classification of in-flight icing hazards for the future airspace system and emerging aircraft, NASA is soliciting proposals for the development of sensor systems for the detection of icing conditions. Examples include the following practical remote sensing systems:Low-cost, ground-based, vertical-pointing with potential scanning capability X-band radar that can operate unattended 24/7/365 and provide calibrated reflectivity and velocity data with hydrometer/cloud particle classification (based upon the reflectivity and velocity data). Low-cost, high-frequency (> 89 GHz) microwave or infrared radiometer technology capable of providing air temperature, water vapor, and liquid water measurements for both ground-based and airborne applications. Wake vortex detection in the terminal area is of particular interest, because closer spacing between aircraft is necessary to facilitate the high-density operations expected in NextGen. Airborne detection of wake vortices is considered challenging due to the fact that detection must be possible in nearly all weather conditions, in order to be practical, and because of the size and nature of the phenomena. Lidar systems have been used successfully for wake detection from off-axis viewing angles, and there is reason to believe that detection is possible from near-axial viewing angles. Other sensor technologies may have untapped potential for wake detection. NASA is soliciting new and innovative research toward the detection of wakes from aircraft, particularly in the terminal area. Specific areas suggested for investigation are sensor measurables (i.e. physical aspects of the hazard that are detectable or measurable by a sensor) associated with wake detection and wake strength; sensor capabilities for detection, tracking, and strength measurement; practical methods for wake hazard analysis, including hazard level evaluation and the bounding of hazardous airspace; and the removal of technical barriers to the use of sensors for airborne wake detection. Proposals may address any or all of the suggested areas. Additional wake vortex research topics are covered in Subtopic A3.02. Proposals may address any or all of the suggested areas.Read less>>"

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.07On-Board Flight Envelope Estimation for Unimpaired and Impaired Aircraft, LaRC, ARC,"A primary goal of the NASA Aviation Safety Program is to develop technology for safe aircraft operation under different types of anomalies. These may occur in a variety of forms, including failed actuators, failed sensors, damaged surfaces or abrupt changes in aerodynamics or large changes in aerodynamics during upsets. As part of the Aviation Safety Program research, the Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control (IRAC) Project is investigating advanced control system concepts to provide greater aircraft resiliency to adverse events. The goal of the IRAC project is to arrive at a set of validated multidisciplinary aircraft control design tools and techniques for enabling safe flight in the presence of adverse conditions. Research on advanced technical approaches (such as direct and indirect adaptive control) has focused on accomplishing stability and safe operability in the presence of anomalies. To be able to effectively develop and apply such methods, it is highly desirable, if not essential, to characterize each anomaly and assess the limits of operation of the impaired vehicle, as control application without regard to the vehicle impairment or adverse condition could have significant detrimental consequences. In particular, it would be desirable to characterize and isolate the anomalous condition, and then estimate the level of controllability, limits of maneuverability, and achievable flight envelope of the vehicle.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.11Integrated Diagnosis and Prognosis of Aircraft Anomalies, ARC," AFRC, GRC, LaRC, SSC","The capability to identify faults and predict their progression is critical to determining appropriate mitigation actions to maintain aircraft safety. This effort is to develop innovative methods and tools for the diagnosis and prognosis of aircraft faults and failures. Proposals are sought for the development of a health management methodology which integrates a prognosis approach with the nature, severity, and uncertainty information from the diagnosis of the faulted system. Diagnosis: The diagnosis element of IVHM includes the development of integrated technologies, tools, and techniques to determine the causal factors, nature, and severity of an adverse event and to distinguish that event from within a family of potential adverse events. These requirements go beyond standard fault isolation techniques. The emphasis is on the development of mathematically rigorous diagnostic technologies that are applicable to structures, propulsion gas path monitoring, software, and other subsystems within the aircraft. Technologies developed must be able to perform diagnosis given heterogeneous and asynchronous signals coming from the health management components of the vehicle and integrating information from each of these components. The ability to actively query health management systems, use advanced decision making techniques to perform the diagnosis, and then assess the severity using these techniques are critical. As an example, the mathematical rigor of the diagnosis and severity assessment could be treated through a Bayesian methodology since it allows for characterization and propagation of uncertainties through models of aircraft failure and degradation. Computational demonstrations using realistic data or prototype hardware implementations of the diagnostic capabilities would be expected at the conclusion of a Phase 2 effort. Other methods could also be employed that appropriately model the uncertainties in the subsystem due to noise and other sources of uncertainty. The ability to actively query the underlying health management systems (whether they are related to detection or not) is critical to reducing the uncertainty in the diagnosis. As an example, if there is ambiguity in the diagnosis about the type and location of a particular failure in the aircraft structure, the diagnostic engine should be able to actively query that system or related systems to determine the true location and severity of the anomaly. Where possible, a rigorous mathematical framework should be employed to provide a rank ordered list of diagnoses, an assessment of the severity of each diagnosed event, along with a measure of the certainty in the diagnosis. Understanding and addressing the system integration and validation issues are critical components of this effort. Prognosis: The prognosis element of IVHM includes the development of technologies, tools, and techniques to determine, given information from detection and diagnosis health management systems and other systems, estimates (with a measure of confidence) of the remaining useful life (RUL) of candidate faults generated by diagnostic engines. The assessment of the RUL could be used by other aircraft systems to place additional restrictions, such as a new operating envelope on the flight control systems. Areas of interest include developing methods for making predictions of RUL which take the uncertainties provided by a candidate diagnostic engine into account, representing and managing uncertainties inherent in such predictions, and developing and applying assessment methodologies for comprehensive and objective evaluation of prognostic algorithm performance.

Aeroelastic behavior of flight vehicles is a particularly challenging facet of that goal. The program's work on aeroelasticity includes conduct of broad-based research and technology development to obtain a fundamental understanding of aeroelastic and unsteady-aerodynamic phenomena experienced by aerospace vehicles, in subsonic, transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic speed regimes. The program content includes theoretical aeroelasticity, experimental aeroelasticity, and advanced aeroservoelastic concepts.

The technical discipline of aeroelasticity is a critical ingredient necessary in the design process of a flight vehicle for assuring freedom from catastrophic aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic instabilities. This discipline requires a thorough understanding of the complex interactions between a flexible structure and the unsteady aerodynamic forces acting on the structure, and at times, active systems controlling the flight vehicle. Complex unsteady aerodynamic flow phenomena, particularly at transonic Mach numbers, are also very important because this is the speed regime most critical to encountering aeroelastic instabilities. In addition, aeroelasticity is presently being exploited as a means for improving the capabilities of high performance aircraft through the use of innovative active control systems using both aerodynamic and smart material concepts. Work to develop analytical and experimental methodologies for reliably predicting the effects of aeroelasticity and their impact on aircraft performance, flight dynamics, and safety of flight are valuable. Subjects to be considered include: Development of design methodologies that include CFD steady and unsteady aerodynamics, flexible structures, and active control systems.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics ,A2.05Aerodynamics, LaRC," AFRC, ARC, GRC","The challenge of flight has at its foundation the understanding, prediction, and control of fluid flow around complex geometries – aerodynamics. Aerodynamic prediction is critical throughout the flight envelope for subsonic, super-sonic, and hypersonic vehicles – driving outer mold line definition, providing loads to other disciplines, and enabling environmental impact assessments in areas such as emissions, noise, and aircraft spacing. In turn, high confidence prediction enables high confidence development and assessment of innovative aerodynamic concepts. This subtopic seeks innovative physics-based models and novel aerodynamic concepts, with an emphasis on flow control, applicable in part or over the entire speed regime from subsonic through hypersonic flight. All vehicle classes will experience subsonic flight conditions. The most fundamental issue is the prediction of flow separation onset and progression on smooth, curved surfaces, and the control of separation. Supersonic and hyper-sonic vehicles will experience supersonic flight conditions. Fundamental to this flight regime is the sonic boom, which to date has been a barrier issue for a viable civil vehicle. Addressing boom alone is not a sufficient mission enabler however, as low drag is a prerequisite for an economically viable vehicle, whether only passing through the supersonic regime, or cruising there. Atmospheric entry vehicles and space access vehicles will experience hyper-sonic flight conditions. Reentry capsules such as the new Crew Exploration Vehicle deploy multiple parachutes during descent and landing. Predicting the physics of unsteady flows in supersonic and subsonic speeds is important for the design of these deceleration systems. The gas-dynamic performance of decelerators for vehicles entering the atmospheres of planets in the solar system is not well understood. Reusable hypersonic vehicles will be designed such that the lower body can be used as an integrated propulsion system in cruise condition. Their performance is likely to suffer in off-design conditions, particularly acutely at transonic speeds. Advanced flow control technologies are needed to alleviate the problem.

These tools will also enable the development of advanced spacecraft for future missions by reducing uncertainties during design and development. The large size and high re-entry velocity of the Crew Exploration Vehicle and the conditions encountered in proposed aerocapture missions to Titan, Neptune, and Venus require study of shock layer radiation phenomena, radiative heat transfer, and non-equilibrium thermodynamic and transport properties; these in turn require understanding of the internal structure and dynamics of the constituent gases. Transition and turbulence effects are particularly complex in hypersonic flows, where unique problems are posed by shocks, real gas effects, body surfaces with complex and possibly time-dependent roughness, nose bluntness, ablation, surface catalyticity, separation, and an unknown free-stream disturbance environment. At the heating rates encountered during hypersonic re-entry, surface ablation products blowing into the boundary layer introduce new interactions including chemical reactions and radiation absorption, that strongly affect surface heating rates and integrated heat loads.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics ,"A2.08Aircraft Systems Analysis, Design and Optimization", GRC," AFRC, ARC, LaRC","One of the approaches to achieve the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Program goals is to solve the aeronautics challenges for a broad range of air vehicles with system-level optimization, assessment and technology integration. The needs to meet this approach can be defined by four general themes: Design Environment Development; Variable Fidelity, Physics-Based Design/Analysis Tools; Technology Assessment and Integration; and Evaluation of Advanced Concepts. Current interdisciplinary design/analysis involves a multitude of tools not necessarily developed to work together, hindering their application to complete system design/analysis studies. Multi-fidelity, multi-disciplinary optimization frameworks, such as Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS), have been developed by NASA but have limited capabilities to simulate complete vehicle systems. Solicited topics are aligned with these four themes that will support this NASA research area. (1) Design Environment Development Technology development is needed to provide complex simulation and modeling capabilities where the computer science details are transparent to the engineer. A framework environment is needed to provide a seamless integration environment where the engineer need not be concerned with where or how particular codes within the system level simulation will be run. Interfaces and utilities to define, setup, verify, determine the appropriate resources, and launch the system simulation are also needed. Research challenges include the engineering details needed to numerically zoom (i.e., numerical analysis at various levels of detail) between multi-fidelity components of the same discipline, as well as, multi-discipline components of the same fidelity. A major computer science challenge is developing boundary objects that will be reused in a wide variety of simulations. Proposals will be considered that enable coupling differing disciplines, numerical zooming within a single discipline, deploying large simulations, and assembling and controlling secure or non-secure simulations. (2) Variable Fidelity, Physics-Based Design/Analysis Tools An integrated design process combines high-fidelity computational analyses from several disciplines with advanced numerical design procedures to simultaneously perform detailed Outer Mold Line (OML) shape optimization, structural sizing, active load alleviation control, multi-speed performance (e.g., low takeoff and landing speeds, but efficient transonic cruise), and/or other detailed-design tasks. Current practice still widely uses sequential, single-discipline optimization, at best coupling low-fidelity modeling of other relevant disciplines during the detailed design phase. Substantial performance improvements will be realized by developing closely integrated design procedures coupled with highest-fidelity analyses for use during detailed-design. Design procedures must enable rapid determination of sensitivities (gradients) of a design objective with respect to all design variables and constraints, choose search directions through design space without violating constraints, and make appropriate changes to the vehicle shape (ideally both external OML shape and internal structural element size). Solicitations are for integrated design optimization tools that find combinations of design variables from more than one discipline and can vary synergistically to produce superior performance compared to the results of sequential, single-discipline optimization or repeated cut-and-try analysis. (3) Technology Assessment and Integration Improved analysis capability of integrated airframe and propulsion systems would allow more efficient designs to be created that would maximize efficiency and performance while minimizing both noise and emissions. Improved integrated system modeling should allow designers to consider trade-offs between various design and operating parameters to determine the optimum design for various classes of subsonic fixed wing aircraft ranging from personal aircraft to large transports. The modeling would also be beneficial if it had enough fidelity to enable it to analyze both conventional and unconventional systems. Current analysis tools capable of analyzing integrated systems are based on simplified physical and semi-empirical models that are not fully capable of analyzing aircraft and propulsion system parameters that would be required for new or unconventional systems. Analysis tools are solicited that are capable of analyzing new and unconventional aircraft and propulsion integrated systems. These include: (1) New combustor designs, alternate fuel operation, and the ability to estimate all emissions, and (2) Noise source models (e.g., fan, jet, turbine, core and airframe components). Analyses tools that are scalable, especially to small aircraft, are desired. (4) Evaluation of Advanced Concepts Conceptual design and analysis of unconventional vehicle concepts and technologies is needed for technology portfolio investment planning, development of advanced concepts to provide technology pull, and independent technical assessment of new concepts. This capability will enable ""virtual expeditions through the design space"" for multi-mission trade studies and optimization. This will require an integrated variable fidelity concept design system. The aerospace flight vehicle conceptual design phase is, in contrast to the succeeding preliminary and detail design phases, the most important step in the product development sequence, because of its predefining function. However, the conceptual design phase is the least well understood part of the entire flight vehicle design process, owing to its high level of abstraction and associated risk, its multidisciplinary design complexity, its permanent shortage of available design information, and its chronic time pressure to find solutions. Currently, the important primary aerospace vehicle design decisions at the conceptual design level (e.g., overall configuration selection) are still made using extremely simple analyses and heuristics. An integrated, variable fidelity system would have large benefits. Higher fidelity tools enabling unconventional configurations to be addressed in the conceptual design process are solicited.

The first part is the Turbomachinery and Heat Transfer and the second part is Propulsion Integration. Turbomachinery and Heat TransferThere is a critical need for advanced turbomachinery and heat transfer concepts, methods and tools to enable NASA to reach its goals in the various Fundamental Aeronautics projects. These goals include drastic reductions in aircraft fuel burn, noise, and emissions, as well as an ability to achieve mission requirements for Subsonic Rotary Wing, Subsonic Fixed Wing, Supersonics, and Hypersonics project flight regimes. In the compression system, advanced concepts and technologies are required to enable high stage loading and wider operating range while maintaining or improving aerodynamic efficiency. Such improvements will enable reduced weight and part count, and will enable advanced variable cycle engines for various missions. In the turbine, the very high cycle temperatures demanded by advanced engine cycles place a premium on the cooling technologies required to ensure adequate life of the turbine component. Reduced cooling flow rates and/or increased cycle temperatures enabled by these technologies have a dramatic impact on the engine performance. Proposals are sought in the turbomachinery and heat transfer area to provide the following specific items: Advanced design concepts to enable increased high stage loading in single and multi-stage axial compressors while maintaining or improving aerodynamic efficiency and operability. Technologies are sought that would reduce dependence on traditional range extending techniques (such as variable inlet guide vane and variable stator geometry) in compression systems.

Novel turbine cooling concepts are sought to enable very high turbine cooling effectiveness especially considering the manufacturability of such concepts. These concepts may include film cooling concepts, internal cooling concepts, and innovative methods to couple the film and internal cooling designs. Concepts proposed should have the potential to be produced with current or forthcoming manufacturing techniques. The availability of advanced manufacturing techniques may actually enable improved cooling designs beyond the current state-of-the-art. Tools and methods are sought to optimize the turbine cooling design including film cooling and internal cooling, especially considering the ability to incorporate such tools into the engine design cycle. Currently, turbine cooling designs are developed via empirical information which may be derived from idealized cases not applicable to the actual turbine flow environment. It would benefit the community greatly to have a validated computational tool for optimizing the turbine cooling design. This tool should allow the prediction of turbine wall temperatures with sufficient accuracy and within reasonable time scales to allow optimization of the film and internal cooling geometrical features.

Examples include planetary systems beyond our own, the detailed inner structure of galaxies with very bright nuclei, binary star formation, and stellar evolution. Contrast ratios of one million to ten billion over an angular spatial scale of 0.05-1.5 arcsec are typical of these objects. Achieving a very low background requires control of both scattered and diffracted light. The failure to control either amplitude or phase fluctuations in the optical train severely reduces the effectiveness of starlight cancellation schemes. This innovative research focuses on advances in coronagraphic instruments, starlight cancellation instruments, and potential occulting technologies that operate at visible and infrared wavelengths. The ultimate application of these instruments is to operate in space as part of a future observatory mission. Much of the scientific instrumentation used in future NASA observatories for the astrophysical sciences will require control of unwanted radiation (thermal and scattered) across a modest field of view. The performance and observing efficiency of astrophysics instruments, however, must be greatly enhanced. The instrument components are expected to offer much higher optical throughput, larger fields of view, and better detector performance. The wavelengths of primary interest extend from the visible to the thermal infrared. Measurement techniques include imaging, photometry, spectroscopy, and polarimetry.

Potential systems include 12 to 30 meter class segmented primary mirrors for UV/optical or infrared wavelengths and 8 to 16 meter class segmented x-ray telescope mirrors. UV/optical telescopes require 1 to 3 meter class mirrors with < 5 nm rms surface figures. IR telescopes require 2 to 3 meter class mirrors with cryo-deformations < 100 nm rms. X-ray telescopes require 1 to 2 meter long grazing incidence segments with angular resolution < 5 arc-sec down to 0.1 arc-sec and surface micro-roughness < 0.5 nm rms. Additionally, missions such as EUSO and OWL need 2 to 9 meter diameter UV-transparent refractive, double-sided Fresnel or diffractive lenses. In view of the very large total mirror or lens collecting aperture required, affordability or areal cost (cost per square meter of collecting aperture) rather than areal density is probably the single most important system characteristic of an advanced optical system. For example, both x-ray and normal incidence space mirrors currently cost $3M to $4M per square meter of optical surface area. This research effort seeks a cost reduction for precision optical components by 20X to 100X to less than $100K per square meter. The primary purpose of this subtopic is to develop and demonstrate technologies to manufacture ultra-low-cost precision optical systems for very large x-ray, UV/optical or infrared telescopes. Potential solutions include but are not limited to direct precision machining, rapid optical fabrication, slumping or replication technologies to manufacture 1 to 2 meter (or larger) precision quality mirror or lens segments (either normal incidence for uv/optical/infrared or grazing incidence for x-ray). An additional key enabling technology for UV/optical telescopes is a broadband (from 100 nm to 2500 nm) high-reflectivity mirror coating with extremely uniform amplitude and polarization properties which can be deposited on 1 to 3 meter class mirrors. Successful proposals will demonstrate prototype manufacturing of a precision mirror or lens system or precision replicating mandrel in the 0.25 to 0.5 meter class with a specific scale up roadmap to 1 to 2+ meter class space qualifiable flight optics systems. Material behavior, process control, optical performance, and mounting/deploying issues should be resolved and demonstrated. The potential for scale-up will need to be addressed from a processing and infrastructure point of view. The Phase 1 deliverable will be at least a 0.25 meter near UV, visible or x-ray precision mirror or lens or replicating mandrel, its optical performance assessment and all data on the processing and properties of its substrate materials. This effort will allow technology to advance to TRL 3-4. The Phase 2 deliverable will be at least a 0.50 meter near UV, visible or x-ray space-qualifiable precision mirror or lens system with supporting documentation, optical performance assessment, all data on materials and processing, and thermal and mechanical stability analysis.

Support telemetry and instrumentation is not part of the this initiative; however, data from any sensors (devices) that are selected from this initiative must be able to be telemetered in-flight using single-channel (two-wire) interface into existing NASA balloon flight support systems. Devices or methods to accurately and continuously measure ambient air, helium gas, and balloon film temperature. The measurements are needed to accurately model the balloon performance during a typical flight at altitudes of approximately 120,000 feet. The measurement must compensate for the effects of direct solar radiation through shielding or calculation. Minimal mass and volume are highly desired. For film measurement, a non-invasive and non-contact approach is highly desired for the thin polyethylene film, with film thickness ranging from 0.8 to 1.5 mil, used as the balloon envelope. Devices for measurement of helium gas and balloon film temperature must be compatible with existing NASA balloon packaging, inflation and launch methods. Devices and/or methods must be able to interface with existing NASA balloon flight support systems or alternatively, a definition of a telemetry solution be provided. Innovations in materials, structures, and systems concepts have also enabled buoyant vehicles to play an expanding role in planning NASA's future Solar System Exploration Program. Balloons and airships are expected to carry scientific payloads on Mars, Venus, and Titan in order to investigate their atmospheres in situ and their surfaces from close proximity. Their envelopes will be subject to extreme environments and must support missions with a range of durations. Proposals are sought in the following areas: Metal Balloons for High Temperature Venus Exploration Balloons made of metals are a potential solution to the problem of enabling long duration flight in the hot lower atmosphere of Venus. Proposals are sought for metal balloon concepts and prototypes that provide 1-5 m3 of fully inflated volume, areal densities of 1 kg/m2 or less, sulfuric acid compatibility at 85% concentration, and operation at 460 °C for a period of up to 1 year. (http://newfrontiers.nasa.gov/program_plan.html) Cryogenic Testing of Titan Aerobots (http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10432(link is external)) Aerobots at Titan must operate at cryogenic temperatures in the range of 85 to 95 K. There is a need for inexpensive test facilities to conduct experiments on sub-scale and full scale prototype balloons ranging in size from 1 to 15 m in their largest dimension. Proposals are sought for the development and validation of innovative, low cost test facilities that can be used to conduct light gas and Montgolfiere balloon experiments with time scales ranging from hours to weeks. Gas Management Systems for Titan Aerobots Hydrogen-filled aerobots at Titan must contend with the problem of gas leakage over long duration (1 year or more) flights. Proposals are sought for the development and testing of two kinds of prototype devices that can be carried on the aerobot to compensate for these gas leakage problems: one device is to produce make-up hydrogen gas from atmospheric methane; the other device is to remove atmospheric gas (mostly nitrogen) that leaks from the ballonets into the hydrogen-filled blimp. Both kinds of devices will need to operate on no more than 15 W of electrical power each while compensating for a leakage rate of at least 40 g/week of hydrogen or 500 g/week of nitrogen. Ground-launched Mars Balloons NASA is interested in small balloons with very light payloads (< 1 kg) that can be autonomously launched on the Martian surface from a lander or large rover. Proposals are sought for balloon designs and systems concepts to enable this. It is important that proposals directly address the difficult problem of not damaging the balloon despite proximity to landed equipment and surface rocks. Preference will be given to proposals that include proof-of-concept experiments addressing key feasibility questions for the proposed approach. Proposals should show an understanding of one or more relevant science needs, and present a feasible plan to fully develop a technology and infuse it into a NASA program. Read less>>"

Novel, low-cost modular adapters and release mechanisms. Lightweight interstage designs. Applications of wireless networking technologies for small launch vehicles are also specifically of interest to this subtopic. This technology could be used for vehicle to ground communications (spread-spectrum and non-licensed technologies), as well as within the vehicle itself. We desire new architectures for intelligent on-board communications as well as satellite-to-satellite communication using machine-to-machine (M2M) solutions. The traditional wire harness architecture could be replaced by the wireless technology for command and control, which would reduce vehicle mass and improve reliability. Also stage-to-stage interfaces and vehicle-payload interfaces are of interest. These wireless technologies can include but are not limited to WIMAXTM and ZIGBEETM. Non-propulsive approaches and architectures for new launch vehicles can also achieve increases in launch vehicle payload mass delivered to orbit for small spacecraft missions. Offerors should consider development, test, and operational factors to show improvements in development and operational costs, payload mass fraction, and mission assurance. Special attention should be given to improved integration between the launch vehicle and payloads to further reduce operational costs. Furthermore, non-propulsive launch vehicle technologies have a dramatic impact on launch vehicle performance and constitute a large percentage of development and operational costs.They include, but are not limited to: Robust on-board Guidance, Navigation and Control (GN&C) avionics.

Emphasis is on low-weight architecture to allow maximum payload capacity. Range safety solutions and operational concepts to lower costs. These may include alternative solutions to expensive explosive destruct packages, including, but not limited to propulsion-cutoff systems, autonomous flight-abort systems, etc. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward a Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration, and when possible, deliver a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract. Phase 2 emphasis should be placed on developing and demonstrating the technology under relevant test conditions.

Science,Topic S4 Low-cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies ,S4.02Rapid End-to-End Mission Design and Simulation, ARC, GSFC,"This subtopic addresses the need to rapidly and efficiently analyze, design, simulate, and evaluate competing mission concepts. The traditional mission design process involves multiple tools and trades, resulting in design data being generated and stored in various proprietary formats, making iterative trades cumbersome. Current mission design and simulation environments require dedicated personnel that execute mission simulations for mission projects, but at a significant cost to project budgets. For efficient mission design and simulation activities, particularly for small satellites and other missions with small budgets and cost margins, there is a need for user-friendly tools that will provide seamless data flow between simulation environments with little overhead. This subtopic seeks proposals for a toolset that shall integrate legacy engineering software with user-generated design and simulation tools into a single, user-friendly environment. The toolset shall automate the flow of data between analysis, design, and simulation applications with minimal user manipulation. The data shall also be preserved through the various design phases from initial concept to execution. Data resources to be linked include cost tracking spreadsheets, task plans, risk management databases, requirements databases, technical performance metrics and margins sheets, top level and WBS element schedules, and standard monthly status reports from WBS elements. The tool should be easily scalable for large or small projects and the number of WBS elements and features included or excluded for a given project should be user-selectable. User and group permission and access controls are required. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward a Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration, and when possible, deliver a demonstration application for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract.

Science,Topic S4 Low-cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies ,S4.03Cost Modeling, ARC," GSFC, JPL","An integrated cost-design model is required, one that incorporates the regression analysis and statistical validity of historical parametric cost models with the flexibility and relevance of a ground-up, or grassroots, cost model. By explicitly focusing on the prime cost determinant, labor, as opposed to the spacecraft parameters, and determining the historic relationships between the tasks on the WBS and cost for a given institution/firm, as opposed to space industry in general, a cost model can be produced that is specific to the production process used by an institution. Such a cost model would predict the cost of individual tasks at sub-system and component levels within a given institution, enabling cost to be included as an endogenously determined variable in the design process. Such an integrated cost-design model is currently embodied only as human capital in individual managers who have, through their personal experience, accumulated knowledge of cost-design relationships. When these experienced managers leave, the institution loses the understanding of the relationship between cost and design choices that the manager had built up through years of experience. Without this experience, ground-up cost models can be wildly inaccurate and as a result, only parametric cost models such as the NASA/Air Force Cost Model (NAFCOM) and the Small Satellite Cost Model (SSCM) are accepted for Technical Management and Cost (TMC) reviews. This is particularly problematic for small low-cost spacecraft where designs are rapidly evolving, management structures are more varied, and the entire purpose is to provide spacecraft at costs lower than what has historically been considered possible. This subtopic seeks proposals to define management system requirements and develop software that would enable cost (and schedule) data at the task-level to be collected and centralized creating a base dataset for institution-based cost models and cost management research. The system would codify cost information of projects ensuring it is preserved beyond the careers of individual managers and would, over time, accumulate long time-series of task-level cost information that would enable ground-up institution-based cost models to stand on a rigorous statistical framework. This would enable the development of a generic institution-based design-cost model that can then be tailored for individual institutions and used across the industry. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward a Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration, and when possible, deliver a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract. In Phase 1, research should provide examples of proven cost benefits and project successes based on the use of integrated management tools for management of multiple simultaneous distributed projects. Architectures should be proposed for implementation of an integrated multi-project management tool. In Phase 2, a management tool set will be implemented and demonstrated as part of an actual small satellite management project. The tool will be evaluated for ease of use, effectiveness as a NASA project set-up tool, management information tool, and reporting tool. Feasibility for a single manager to effectively manage and report on multiple simultaneous projects will be assessed. Project users from the WBS elements of the satellite project will evaluate ease of use of uploading data.

Science,Topic S4 Low-cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies ,S4.04Reusable Flight Software, ARC, GSFC,"There is a need to rapidly develop and deploy small satellites and easily adapt new payloads in a cost effective manner. The cost of flight software, including algorithms and data management, is continuing to increase and multiply in complexity. Spacecraft software applications are typically customized, however, development costs can be driven down and a plug-and-play capability can be fostered through repeated use of reusable software and functional libraries that are developed once and updated only to enhance performance or correct deficiencies. Small satellites can be effectively designed for multiple uses of the same nominal hardware set to perform multiple missions. Interfaces between differing payloads are anticipated to be ""plug-and-play"", where the interface between hardware elements is transparent across the interface. This implies that and allows the software to be reusable from mission to mission. An analogy would be a reusable core executive operating system that controls central satellite functions. Each payload or special hardware element will have subservient applications, written by the element developed that provides special needs. In order to be most economical, the subservient applications should be capable of utilizing an extensive library of modules. This subtopic calls for the definition and development of a common core executive software and library modules that can be utilized repeatedly for many small satellite missions. The software shall be portable between several types of core processors. The executive and libraries shall provide robust functionality, based on open standards that can be utilized by specialized payload and component developers. In this manner, a minimum amount of custom software, limited to basic functional control of certain hardware elements, will be required. Library functions within the reusable core executive shall be capable of performing computation intense work. The intent is to not modify the reusable core executive except as experience dictates from previous missions. The Reusable Flight Software subtopic encourages offerors to utilize open source software and hardware solutions to be utilized for other actors, including entrepreneurial and university teams, for reusability.

This call is not for sensor processing algorithms. Sensing technologies are desired which determine the entry point of the spacecraft in the Mars atmosphere; provide inputs to systems that control spacecraft trajectory, speed, and orientation to the surface; locate the spacecraft relative to the Martian surface; evaluate potential hazards at the landing site; and determine when the spacecraft has touched down. Appropriate sensing technologies for this topic should provide measurements of physical forces or properties that support some aspect of EDL operations. NASA also seeks to use measurements made during EDL to better characterize the Martian atmosphere, providing data for improving atmospheric modeling for future landers. Proposals are invited for innovative sensor technologies that improve the reliability of EDL operations. Products or technologies are sought that can be made compatible with the environmental conditions of spaceflight and the rigors of landing on the Martian surface. Successful candidate sensor technologies can address this call by: Providing critical measurements during the entry phase (e.g., pressure and/or temperature sensors embedded into the aeroshell); Improving the accuracy on measurements needed for guidance decisions (e.g., surface relative velocities, altitudes, orientation, localization); Extending the range over which such measurements are collected (e.g., providing a method of imaging through the aeroshell, or terrain-relative navigation that does not require imaging through the aeroshell); Enhancing the situational awareness during landing by identifying hazards (rocks, craters, slopes), or pro-viding indications of approach velocities and touchdown; Substantially reducing the amount of external processing needed to calculate the measurements; and Significantly reducing the impact of incorporating such sensors on the spacecraft in terms of volume, mass, placement, or cost.

Science,Topic S5 Robotic Exploration Technologies ,"S5.02Sample Collection, Processing, and Handling", JPL," ARC, GSFC, JSC","Robust systems for sample acquisition, handling and processing are critical to the next generation of robotic explorers for investigation of planetary bodies (http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10432&page=R1(link is external)). Limited spacecraft resources (power, volume, mass, computational capabilities, and telemetry bandwidth) demand innovative, integrated sampling systems that can survive and operate in challenging environments (extremes in temperature, pressure, gravity, vibration and thermal cycling). Relevant systems could be integrated on multiple platforms, however of primary interest are samplers that could be mounted on a mobile platform, such as a rover. For reference, current Mars-relevant rovers range in mass from 200 – 800 kg. Sample AcquisitionResearch should be conducted to develop compact, low-power, lightweight subsurface sampling systems that can obtain 1 cm diameter cores of consolidated material (e.g., rock, icy regolith) up to 10 cm below the surface. Systems should be capable of autonomously acquiring and ejecting samples reliably. Other sample types of interest are unconsolidated regolith, dust, and atmospheric gas. Sample Manipulation (core management, sub-sampling/sorting)Sample manipulation technologies are needed to enable handling and transfer of structured and unstructured samples from a sampling device to instruments and sample processing systems. Core and regolith samples may be variable in size and composition, so a sample manipulation system needs to be flexible enough to handle the sample variability. Core samples will be on the order of 1 cm diameter and up to 10 cm long. Soil and rock fragment samples will be of similar volumes. System Robustness and ReliabilityConsideration should be given to potential failure scenarios for integrated systems. For example, recovery and mitigation techniques for platform slip and borehole misalignment should be addressed. Significant attention should be given to the sensing and automation required for real-time control, fault diagnosis and recovery. In the case of rover-mounted subsurface sampling systems, the ability to release under load will be critical to mitigate risk of losing mobility if unexpected subsurface conditions are encountered. Sample Integrity (encapsulation and contamination)For a sample return mission, it is critical to find solutions for maintaining physical integrity of the sample during the surface mission (rover driving loads, diurnal temperature fluctuations) as well as the return to Earth (cruise, atmospheric entry and impact). Technologies are needed for characterizing state of sample in situ – physical integrity (e.g., cracked, crushed), sample volume, mass or temperature, as well as retention of volatiles in solid (core, regolith) samples, and retention of atmospheric gas samples. Also of particular need are means of acquiring subsurface rock and regolith samples with minimum contamination. This contamination may include contaminants in the sampling tool itself, material from one location contaminating samples collected at another location (sample cross-contamination), or Earth-source microorganisms brought to the Martian surface prior to drilling ('clean' sampling from a 'dirty' surface). Consideration should be given to use of materials and processes compatible with 110-125°C dry heat sterilization. In situ sterilization may be explored, as well as innovative mechanical or system solutions – e.g., single-use sample “sleeves,” or fully-integrated sample acquisition and encapsulation systems. For a sample return mission, sample transfer of a payload into a Planetary Ascent Vehicle (PAV) Automated payload transfer mechanisms; Orbiting Sample (OS) sealing techniques.

Mobility technology is needed to enable access to difficult-to-reach sites such as access through steep terrain. Many scientifically valuable sites are accessible only via terrain that is too steep for state-of-the-art planetary rovers to traverse. Sites include crater walls, canyons, and gullies. Tethered systems, non-wheeled systems, and marsupial systems are examples of mobility technologies that are of interest. Tether technology could enable new approaches for deployment, retrieval and mobility. Innovative marsupial systems could allow a pair of vehicles with different mobility characteristics to collaborate to enable access to challenging terrain. Single vehicle systems might utilize a 200 kg class rover and dual vehicle systems might utilize a 500-800 kg primary vehicle that provides long traverse to the vicinity of a challenging site and then deployment of a smaller 20-50 kg vehicle with steep mobility capability for access and sampling at the site. Technologies to enable acquisition of subsurface samples are also needed. Technologies are needed to acquire core samples in the shallow subsurface to about 10cm and to enable subsurface sampling in multiple holes at least 1 - 3 meters deep through rock, regolith or ice compositions. Shallow subsurface sampling systems need to be low mass and deeper subsurface sampling solutions need to be integratable onto 500-800 kg stationary landers and mobile platforms. Consideration should be given for potential failure scenarios, such as platform slip and borehole misalignment for integrated systems, and the challenges of dry drilling into mixed media including icy mixtures of rock and regolith. Systems should ensure minimal contamination of samples from Earth-source contaminants and cross-contamination from samples at different locations or depths.

New approaches to software frameworks or APIs are discouraged. Technological advances should leverage or extend existing standards or capabilities within the respective science communities (i.e., Sensor Mark-up Language, Virtual Observatory, Earth Science Federation standards, Planetary data standards). Proposals can develop instrument specific software if demonstrated how the software can improve instrument performance (such as improving sensor calibration and correction of data in a tightly closed loop without human intervention). Other examples would show how on-board data processing enables rapid analysis or data sharing between instruments/platforms (e.g., perform level 0, level 1 or level 2 processing on-board the sensor or platform to support decision making based on data results).

NASA is soliciting proposals for software tools which access, fuse, process, and analyze image and vector data for the purpose of analyzing NASA's space and Earth science mission data. Tools and products might be used for broad public dissemination or for communicating within a narrower scientific community. These tools can be plug-ins or enhancements to existing software or on-line services. They also can be new stand-alone applications or web services, provided that they are compatible with most widely-used computer platforms and exchange information effectively (via standard protocols and file formats) with existing, popular applications. It is highly desirable that the project development leads to software that is infused into NASA programs and projects. To promote interoperability, tools shall use industry standard protocols, formats, and APIs, including compliance with the ISO, FDGC, and OGC standards as appropriate.

Science,Topic S6 Information Technologies ,S6.05Software as a Service to Large Scale Modeling, GSFC, ARC,"Currently there are notable obstacles in making NASA's Earth and space science research models useful to new investigators. Much of the software, upwards of hundreds of thousands of lines of code per model, has evolved gradually over the past three decades. At their inceptions the individual numerical models were intricate elements of independent research projects, intended to be mostly internal products rather than tools contributing to a larger, collaborative effort in Earth and space sciences. Hence today when investigators from outside the developers' organizations choose to begin a collaboration, or merely want to use the model for their own benefit, they are often required to adhere to the unfamiliar development environment of the host institution. This environment typically includes the regulation and management of the software repository, the data management system, and the high-end computing platforms. Problems that arise from this type of a work arrangement include: IT security policies that restrict certain individuals from obtaining access to Government facilities (especially with providing foreign national graduate students access to the institutional high-end computers that host a particular model); Knowledge of running a model residing ""in the heads"" of support programmers, often too busy to assist outsiders; Interface components residing in individuals' directories unknown to others who might take advantage of them; User administration practices (userids, passwords, filesystem/data management, other IT security rules) that are specific to one agency's computing center; A lack of front-end tools available to other model developers to set up and run collaborative experiments. The Agency seeks a computational ""service layer"" to enhance NASA's scientific numerical modeling efforts. The goal is to improve the accessibility of the models to universities and other Government institutions for research and operations. Proposals are sought that develop methods for hosting NASA's Earth and space science models under a ""Software As A Service (SaaS)"" paradigm. Proposal are also sought which couple model components and ancillary programs under a service-oriented architecture. A feasibility study should be conducted during Phase 1 that will lead to a Phase 2 prototype that makes use of a NASA Earth or space science numerical model. Under such a scenario the back-end supercomputing environment should be segregated from the user's work environment while providing an interface to specific, secure services that will allow (1) execution of the model as a ""black box"" and (2) the ability to edit model elements, upload, recompile, and execute. Proposals should show an understanding of one or more relevant science needs, and present a feasible plan to fully develop a technology and infuse it into a NASA program. Read less>>"
Exploration Systems,Topic X1 Avionics and Software ,X1.01Automation for Vehicle and Habitat Operations, ARC, JPL,"Automation will be instrumental for decreasing workload, reducing dependence on Earth-based support staff, enhancing response time, and releasing crew and operators from routine tasks to focus on those requiring human judgment, leading to increased efficiency and reduced mission risk. To enable the application of intelligent automation and autonomy techniques, the technologies need to address two significant challenges: adaptability and software validation. Reusable automation software must be adaptable to new applications without undue difficulty, and easily adjusted as the application operations change. The software and the adaptation to a given application must also be trusted before it can be accepted. Proposals are solicited in the areas of: Automation Support ToolsSupport tools are needed to facilitate the authoring and validation of plans and execution scripts. Tools that are not tied specifically to one executive would provide NASA the most flexibility in applying such tools across projects. Examples of needed capabilities include: Graphical tool for monitoring and debugging plan execution; Graphical tool for creating and editing execution scripts; Tools for authoring and validating execution plans; User friendly abstraction of low-level execution languages by adding syntactic enhancements. Decision Support Systems Decision support systems amplify the efficiency of operators by providing the information they need when and where they need it. Decision support tools are needed that: Command and supervise complex tasks while projecting the outcome of actions and identify potential problems; Understand system state, including visualization and summarization; Allow the system to interact with a user when generating the plan and allow evaluation of alternate courses of action; Integrate a planning and scheduling system as part of an on-board, closed loop controller; Scale up existing techniques to larger problem applications. Trustable Systems Systems that support or interact with crew require a very high level of reliability. Tools are needed that improve the reliability and trustworthiness of autonomous systems.

Exploration Systems,Topic X1 Avionics and Software ,X1.02Reliable Software for Exploration Systems, ARC," JPL, JSC, LaRC","The objective of this subtopic is to develop software engineering technologies that enable engineers to cost-effectively develop and maintain NASA mission-critical software systems. Particular emphasis will be on software engineering technologies applicable to the high levels of reliability needed for human-rated space vehicles. A key requirement is that proposals address the usability of software engineering technologies by NASA engineers, and not only specialists in the technology. Many of the capabilities needed for successful human exploration of space will rely on software. In addition to traditional capabilities, such as GNC (guidance, navigation, and control) or C&DH (command and data handling), new capabilities are under development: integrated vehicle health management, autonomous vehicle-centered operations, automated mission operations, and, further out, mixed human-robotic teams to accomplish mission objectives. It will be challenging, but critical to NASA's exploration objectives to ensure that these capabilities are reliable and can be developed and maintained affordably. Mission phases that can be addressed include not only the software life-cycle (requirement engineering through verification and validation) but also upstream activities (e.g., mission planning that incorporates trade-space for software-based capabilities) and post-deployment (e.g., new approaches for computing fault tolerance, rapid reconfiguration, and certification of mission-critical software systems). Software engineering tools and methods that address reliability for exploration missions are sought, including: Automated software generation methods from engineering models that ensure integrity; for example, methods ensuring semantic equivalence between UML models and generated code, generated code optimizations that preserve semantics, and tools that provide navigable two-way traceability from models to code. Methods for ensuring safe modification and updates to existing code. Scalable verification technologies for complex mission software.

Exploration Systems,Topic X1 Avionics and Software ,X1.03Radiation Hardened/Tolerant and Low Temperature Electronics and Processors, LaRC," GSFC, MSFC","The goal of leaving low Earth orbit for the purpose of human and robotic exploration will require avionic systems and components that are capable of operating in the extreme temperature and radiation environments of deep space, the lunar surface, and eventually the Martian surface. Spacecraft vehicle electronics will be required to operate across a wide temperature range and must be capable of enduring frequent (and often rapid) thermal-cycling. Packaging for these electronics must be able to accommodate the mechanical stress and fatigue associated with the thermal cycling. Spacecraft vehicle electronics must be radiation hardened for the target environment. They must be capable of operating through a total ionizing dose (TID) of 100 krads (Si) or more and providing single-event latchup immunity (SEL) of 100 MeV cm2/mg or more. Considering the extreme environment performance parameters for thermal and radiation extremes, proposals are sought in the following specific areas: Low power, high efficiency, radiation-hardened processor technologies optimized for numerically intensive algorithms and applications, capable of a sustained processor throughput of 5 GMACS for 16-bit operations and a sustained processor efficiency of 5 GMACS/W.

In human space flight, a significant concern for NASA is the safety of ground and flight crews under off-nominal or failure conditions. The stringent launch availability requirements of the Constellation Program challenge traditional vehicle processing and launch operations. Some of the challenges for the new architecture include optimization of sensors (placement, physical and functional redundancy, weight and cost), validation of inherently unreliable sensors, increasing the effective capability for state determination using innovative analysis algorithms, and integration of sensor information distributed across ground support equipment and the vehicles in multiple processing locations and phases. Diagnostic and prognostic analyses which provide an accurate assessment of system and component health will ensure the completion of complex launch processing flows on schedule. Projects may focus on one or more relevant subsystems such as solid rocket motors, liquid propulsion systems, structures and mechanisms, thermal protection systems, power, avionics, life support, and communications. Proposals that involve the use of existing testbeds or facilities at one of the participating NASA centers (ARC, MSFC, KSC, or JPL) for technology validation and maturation are strongly encouraged. Specific technical areas of interest related to integrated systems health management include the following: Innovative methods for sensor validation and robust state estimation in the presence of inherently unreliable sensors. Proposals should focus on data analysis and interpretation during pre-flight checkout using legacy sensors rather than development of new sensors or sensor systems. Model-based methods for fault detection and isolation in rocket propulsion systems based on existing sensor suites during pre-launch propellant loading and during mission operations. Concepts for advanced built-in-tests for spacecraft avionics that reduce or eliminate the need for extensive functional verification and to predict remaining life of avionics systems based on usage history.

Exploration Systems,Topic X2 Environmental Control and Life Support ,X2.01Spacecraft Cabin Ventilation and Thermal Control, JSC," ARC, GRC, GSFC, JPL, JSC, KSC, LaRC, MSFC","Advanced technologies are sought for cabin ventilation and thermal management for next generation human spacecraft including lunar lander, lunar habitat, and pressurized rovers. Spacecraft VentilationControlling acoustic noise levels within spaceflight vehicles is needed to provide for adequate voice and ground communications, habitability, and alarm audibility. This will become very important with longer duration missions such as Lunar Habitat and Mars missions. Past experience has shown that controlling acoustic noise levels inside the spacecraft depend upon development of quiet ventilation system and environmental control system fans and pumps, as well as inclusion of effective noise controls to reduce the noise that is created (i.e., source and path technologies). Advances are sought in the general areas of source noise-level reduction, vibration isolation, acoustic absorption, and sound blocking and sealing (i.e., source and packaging). Noise reduction technology should achieve significant noise reductions (> 5dB) with minimal impacts to performance characteristics (pressure rise and flow rate). Noise reductions and performance capabilities should be demonstrated. Materials should meet flight requirements for flammability, frangibility, and off-gassing. Ventilation fans and fluid pumps are the major source of interior spacecraft noise. Fan and pump technologies that prevent the generation of acoustic noise or limit its transmission to mounting structure or surrounding air are desired. Technologies achieving 5 dB or greater attenuation and accommodating variable equipment speeds, variable acoustic spectrums, and atmospheric pressures from 8 to 15 psia are required. Thermal Control SystemsFuture spacecraft will require more sophisticated thermal control systems that can dissipate or reject greater heat loads at higher input heat fluxes while using fewer of the limited spacecraft mass, volume and power resources. The thermal control designs also must accommodate the harsh environments associated with these missions including dust and high sink temperatures. Modular, reconfigurable designs could limit the number of required spares. The lunar environment presents several challenges to the design and operation of active thermal control systems. During the Apollo program, landings were located and timed to occur early in the lunar day, resulting in a benign thermal environment. The long duration polar lunar bases that are foreseen in 15 years will see extremely cold thermal environments, as will the radiators for Martian transit spacecraft. Long sojourns remote from low-Earth orbit will require lightweight, but robust and reliable systems. Innovative thermal management components and systems are needed to accomplish the rejection of heat from lunar bases. Advances are sought in the general areas of radiators, thermal control loops and equipment. Variable emissivity coatings, clever working fluid selection, or robust design could be used to prevent radiator damage from freezing at times of low heat load. Also, the dusty environment of an active lunar base may require dust mitigation and removal techniques to maintain radiator performance over the long term. The lunar base may include high efficiency, long life mechanical pumps. Part of the thermal control system in the lunar base is likely to be a condensing heat exchanger, which should be designed to preclude microbial growth. Small heat pumps could be used to provide cold fluid to the heat exchanger, increasing the average heat rejection temperature and reducing the size of the radiators. Thermal management of the lunar habitat, landers, and rovers may require mechanically pumped two-phase fluid loops. Innovative design of the loops and components is needed. Future space systems may generate large amounts of waste heat which could either be rejected or redirected to areas which require it. Novel thermal bus systems which can obtain, transport, and reject heat between various components are sought. The system should be highly configurable and adaptable to changes in equipment locations. Large diurnal temperature changes in the environment are expected. Possible systems include single and two-phase pumped fluid loops, capillary-based loops, and heat pumps. A scaling methodology is needed to allow long term 1-g testing of two-phase systems (including pumped two-phase loops, heat pumps, and condensing heat exchangers) representative of the 1/6th Earth-normal gravity of the Moon.

Removing and disposing of particulate matter originating from sources internal to the habitable cabin and from surface dust intrusion is of interest. Process technologies and equipment that efficiently remove the range of particulate matter sizes and morphologies encountered in a crewed spacecraft cabin from the atmosphere and surfaces are sought. Candidate technology solutions should provide high efficiency and long-lived removal capacity. Successful process technologies must be tolerant of the abrasive properties of lunar surface dust. Performance should be demonstrated with appropriate lunar dust analogs or simulants. Process technologies sought must be highly efficient and promote safe disposal of accumulated particulate matter.

These may include but are not limited to mechanical filtration, inertial separation and impingement, and electrostatic and/or electrically enhanced separation solid-gas processes that are light-weight, low power and operate at reduced atmospheric pressures. Process technologies that offer both improved efficiency and are suitable for in situ regeneration as described below are preferred. Novel techniques and materials are of interest. Regenerative Processes and Filters: Regenerable solid-gas separations techniques and process technologies are sought that effectively handle a broad size range from >100 microns in aerodynamic diameter to Vacuum Cleaner for Planetary Surface Vehicles and Habitats: Portable crew-operated devices for removing particulate matter from a wide range of surfaces (polymer, metallic, and fabric), operating at cabin atmospheric pressures ranging from 8 to 15 psia, and minimizing electrical power and acoustic noise generation are of interest. Successful devices may employ several of the above mentioned processes or filtration systems to remove a wide range of particulate matter sizes up to 2 mm in aerodynamic diameter without contaminating the air with ultrafine particulates. The ability for the portable device to be operated as a supplemental, portable cabin air filtration unit is a plus. Atmospheric Resource Management Atmospheric resource management encompasses process technologies and equipment to supply, store, and condition atmospheric gases; provide gaseous oxygen at pressures at or above 3,600 psia; and achieve mass closure by recycling resources and using in situ resources. Areas of emphasis include:Carbon Dioxide Reduction for Recovery of Oxygen: Process technologies for reducing carbon dioxide to a carbon product via high single-pass reaction efficiency with a product yield >90% are of interest. Successful process technologies and/or process technology unit operations combinations must demonstrate efficient power use and address safety issues associated with traditional reduction processes. High Pressure Oxygen Gas Supply: Process technologies leading to an on-demand, in-flight renewable source of oxygen at or above 3,600-psia are of interest.

In the former situation such mechanisms may be exposed to, and will need to operate in, sink temperatures as low as approximately 25K. In the latter situation they will need to operate over a temperature sink range of approximately 83K to 403K (-190°C to +130°C). A five year lifetime is desired.

Monitoring is needed for improved robustness and reliability of composite structures or the mass advantage and performance of composites may not be realized. Adding sensors efficiently at any point in the vehicle lifetime is a necessity since some monitoring is needed for troubleshooting, validation of the loads, strain and thermal environment. Sensors and their acquisition systems are needed that require a reduced wire infrastructure. Acoustic Emissions (AE) sensors have been shown to receive indications well out ahead of failure. Since propagation distance varies with each configuration and expected fault, many sensors will be needed to ensure composite health. The amount of wiring needed with standard approaches can offset much of the weight savings from composites and increase costs. New AE sensor mounting methods and flexible sensors are needed that accommodate sometimes highly curved surfaces, don't fail or unbond at cryogenic tank temperatures and withstand high G loading. Very small sensors will need to be embedded at times to accommodate cases where attaching is impractical or the phenomenon can best be measured from within the composite structure. Wireless sensors and wireless data acquisition systems with local processing of the composite structures events are needed to reduce the wiring and total data handling needs. Totally passive wireless sensor-tags can have advantages in certain applications. Applications include: Advanced composite structures such as cryotanks, large area composites such as launch vehicle fairings, hard to access/inspect composite members, as well as metallic pressurized structures of all kinds.

A material system (resin + fiber) which displays high resistance to microcracking at cryogenic temperatures is necessary for linerless cryotanks which provide the most weight-saving potential. This SBIR will focus on development of toughened, high strength composite materials because the literature indicates that they have the highest microcrack resistance at cryogenic temperatures. Greatest interest is in novel approaches to increase resin strength and/or reduce resin CTE, thereby increasing resistance to microcracking at cryogenic temperature. Possible topics could include use of toughening agents, novel surface treatments for carbon fibers, reduced-temperature curing methods that reduce residual thermal stresses, etc. Performance enhancements would be evaluated by a characterization program, which would ideally generate temperature-dependent material properties including strength, modulus, and CTE as functions of temperature. Additionally, notch sensitivity, plain strain fracture toughness, and microcracking fracture toughness as functions of temperature are desirable. Tests will need to be performed at temperatures between -273°C and 23°C to fully characterize any nonlinearity in material properties with changes in temperature. Initial property characterization would be done at the coupon level in Phase 1.

Propellant subcooling or densification systems for LOX, LH2 and LCH4 are required, to provide for extended storage duration on orbit prior to boil off. These systems should be sized to accommodate the Altair propulsion system. Densification systems should offer reliability and efficiency benefits over past systems. Anti-stratification concepts to ensure homogeneous fluid conditions in the flight tank are needed, and better transfer line insulation to minimize heat leak are required. Connections and recirculation systems to maintain propellant state in the flight tank are also desired. On the lunar surface, oxygen may be produced via an in situ resource utilization reactor. Efficient liquefaction of this oxygen will depend on integration of the liquefier with the gas production stream. Open cycle liquefaction systems must interface with the high-pressure electrolysis systems at the output of the reactor. Compact, low temperature radiators capable of rejecting 50-100W of heat at 140K to deep space are needed for passive cooling prior to the final liquefaction steps. High efficiency, low mass recuperative heat exchangers are needed for effective heat transfer between gas streams. Innovative heat rejection systems designed for the lunar thermal environment are needed. Heat pumps to increase the high temperature heat rejection point of the cycle can also be proposed.

Exploration Systems,Topic X10 Exploration Medical Capability ,X10.01In Flight Diagnosis and Treatment, JSC," ARC, GRC","Proposals may respond to one or more of the following areas: Non-Toxic Sprain/Strain TreatmentWith longer missions and more labor intensive tasks expected in the Constellation Program, the likelihood of musculoskeletal injuries such as sprains and strains are expected to increase. Standard terrestrial therapeutic response to treating sprains and strains is to provide cold compress or heat treatment to the affected area. The focus of this subtopic is to develop a reusable cold compress and/or heat treatment that can be stowed in its inactive state in the vehicle’s ambient environment, activated to provide the desired therapeutic relief, recharged using available vehicle resources, and restowed in its inactive state for future use. This capability is desired on the International Space Station and all Constellation Program vehicles that support missions involving labor intensive tasks or exercise countermeasures. Efforts should be made to minimize the volume and mass footprint of the deployed system so that when activated and treating the patient, the patient will have mobility and free movement to continue with mission tasks and objectives. The cold compress and heat treatment capability can be provided through separate systems and does not necessarily have to be the same piece of hardware. The materials used shall be non-toxic in the quantities provided. Current terrestrial solutions are undesirable due to the chemicals involved, onetime use designs or requirement for pre-cooling (e.g., freezer) or pre-heating (e.g., microwave) devices. Phase 1 Requirements: Phase 1 would include trade studies with reports and down select recommendation. A prototype is preferable. Phase 2 Requirements: Phase 2 would deliver a working prototype and documentation packages for NASA safety and design reviews. Reusable Diagnostic Lab TechnologyOn-board clinical diagnostics to monitor crew member physiology must be available for both mid-term lunar and long-term Mars exploration missions. As in terrestrial medicine, devices with which to measure multiple constituents of small volume samples of bodily fluids are crucial components in assessing astronaut health. Nevertheless, mass, space, and power requirements of such devices are an obvious concern in an environment with scarce resources. Miniaturized laboratory analysis sensors represent a potential solution, given that these devices and supporting hardware are designed to be small, lightweight, and require little power. However, current sensor cartridges are typically single-use with limited shelf life. In order to satisfy the needs of longer duration exploration missions, reusable laboratory analysis sensors with increased shelf life must be designed without compromising accuracy or sensitivity. NASA seeks proposals for developing such reusable laboratory analysis sensors for analysis of bodily fluids, including blood, urine and saliva. The ability to analyze whole blood for a complete blood count with differential and hemoglobin is essential. Priority will be given to designs which also incorporate onboard detection capabilities for other analytes, such as electrolytes, lipids, proteins and hormones. Multiplexed systems providing runtime selection of the assay suite are also desirable. The detection system should minimize the use of electrical power, external optics or other infrastructure, and the use of reagents and additives. The device can rely on a PC or PDA for signal processing and display if desired, but the footprint of all other components should be tightly controlled. The best design will require minimal user interaction for processing or maintenance. Phase 1 Requirements: During Phase 1, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility with a draft end item functional requirements document. Phase 1 will also produce documentation showing a viable path to a Phase 2 breadboard demonstration. Lightweight/Compact Oxygen ConcentratorConcentrated oxygen for medical use is a consumable that when used cannot be replenished. Due to relatively low metabolic consumption, a large percentage of the concentrated oxygen is not consumed but is instead released into the vehicle’s cabin where it offers minimal medical use and is essentially wasted. This release of concentrated oxygen leads to increased ambient oxygen levels to the point where the vehicle oxygen fire limit will be exceeded. An effective solution to both these issues involves use of an oxygen concentrator that can take ambient air and re-concentrate the oxygen providing medical grade oxygen and removing excess oxygen from the vehicle cabin. However, oxygen concentrator technology to date is mostly large, massive, and power intensive. The focus of this subtopic is to develop a small, lightweight, portable oxygen concentrator that can produce concentrated medical oxygen using ambient vehicle cabin air. Of particular interest is oxygen concentration technology that can produce at minimum 60% oxygen at 4-6 liters per minute. Efforts should be made to minimize the volume, mass, and power draw of the system. The oxygen concentrator will use vehicle power as its primary source of power; however there is a brief need for battery power for when the patient is transported between vehicles. This technology is desired on ISS and future exploration vehicles supporting long duration missions. Phase 1 Requirements: Phase 1 deliverables should include trade studies with down select criteria and recommendations for which technology will best meet the O2 concentrator figures of merit. A requirements document for a Phase 2 prototyping effort should also be included. Read less>>"
Exploration Systems,Topic X10 Exploration Medical Capability ,X10.02EVA Suit Monitoring and Treatment, JSC," ARC, GRC","Proposals may respond to one or more of the following areas:Through-Suit Medication Delivery NASA operations concepts envision contingencies where astronauts may be required to wear Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) suits for up to 120 hours. If a crewmember requires medication while in a suit, a method of administration must be developed that does not compromise the integrity of the suit, nor the environment it provides. Current concepts for the EVA suit include a self-sealing diaphragm through which injections could be given. However, fluid management in microgravity presents problems with filling a syringe and delivering medication in such an environment. The three main concerns are preventing bubbles from being injected, appropriate fluid management, and excessive volume requirements for pre-loaded syringes. Due to uncertainties about when such an event might occur, the system would have to function in the range of gravity levels between 0 to 1G, as well as pressure levels from vacuum to 1 atmosphere, and require very little volume and no power. Accordingly, NASA seeks proposals detailing concepts for such a system. Phase 1 Requirements: Phase 1 would include appropriate trade studies, design concepts, and any limited laboratory proof-of-concept testing required to support Phase 2 development. Phase 2 Requirements: Phase 2 would include fabrication, testing, and validation of breadboard hardware that could be delivered to NASA for evaluation at the conclusion of Phase 2. Phase 2 would be a commercial system that NASA or a prime contractor could integrate within the Exploration Medical Kit. Biosensors for Lunar EVA SuitsDuring surface Extravehicular Activities (EVAs), it is anticipated that the flight surgeons will need the ability to monitor heart rate, heart rhythm (ECG), derived core body temperature, and calculated metabolic rate to ensure the health and safety of the crewmember. Of particular interest are technologies that would allow data to be collected, with minimal crew time or effort required to don/doff the measurement hardware, while also maintaining crew comfort (i.e., sensors NOT involving skin preparation, gels, or taping). Also of interest are technologies/systems that would allow the collection of robust, diagnostic quality signals even during periods of strenuous lunar surface operations (lifting, climbing ladders, recovering from falls, and assembling structures). Phase 1 Requirements: Phase 1 should deliver prototype functioning sensors, but not necessarily in their final form. A report showing prototype function versus a benchmark system’s function will be provided. Also a roadmap to getting to the final sensor will be provided. Phase 2 Requirements: Phase 2 should deliver sensors in their spaceflight-friendly, miniaturized form. Data from spaceflight analog testing using protocols delivered from NASA will also be expected.

Flight surgeons have stated the need for unobtrusive monitoring tools that are transparent to crews, require minimal crew time or effort, and that help detect if crews are having difficulties with coping with the spaceflight environment. The aim of this subtask is to provide tools that will automatically generate feedback for astronauts and flight surgeons, regarding team cohesion and behavioral health status of crews in-flight.

Exploration Systems,Topic X12 Space Human Factors and Food Systems ,X12.01Space Human Factors Assessment Tools, JSC," ARC, GRC","Operations in confined, isolated, and foreign environments can lead to impairments of human performance. This subtopic seeks methods for monitoring, modeling, and predicting human performance in the spaceflight environment for accurate and valid human system integration into vehicle design and operations. In particular, the Space Human Factors Engineering Project within the Human Research Program is interested in obtaining timely and context-specific Human Factors (HF) incident data. Currently, space HF data come from crew debriefs. Such debriefs rely on retrospective recall, which could suffer delays of up to six months. Furthermore, opportunities to discuss HF issues in detail during these debriefs are limited. Consequently, the HRP sees the need to develop an automated human factors incident reporting tool. Objective: Development of tool that assists the gathering and reporting HF incidents for long-duration space missions. Requirements: In general, the tool will be used to help detect areas where HF can contribute to mission success, assess the effects of operational and hardware changes, and complement existing HF data sources for operations. Specifically, the tool shall meet the following requirements: The crew shall have easy access to the tool at any time to eliminate the need for the crew to recall information retrospectively. An easy-to-use data gathering protocol with the following functionalities: Allow data to be entered either as text, audio, and/or video inputs, It is desirable for tool to detect a system anomaly automatically and immediately record system status. At a minimum, however, the tool should provide an easily accessible event marker for the crew to mark the context and take a snapshot of the system and operator system status. Provide a user-friendly automated data search engine for extracting meaningful incident information from the raw data. Examples of desirable search schemes include natural language, spatial, temporal searches, etc. Phase 1 Requirements: The technical merit of the tool will be explored to evaluate feasibility. The Phase 1 report will include results of the evaluation/research/ or development of automated data mining technologies, definition of optimal data gathering protocol(s), and recommendations for optimal hardware/software design. Development of hardware and software algorithms is highly desirable.

Exploration Systems,Topic X12 Space Human Factors and Food Systems ,X12.02Advanced Food Technologies, JSC," ARC, GRC","The purpose of the Advanced Food Technology Project is to develop, evaluate and deliver food technologies for human centered spacecraft that will support crews on missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. Safe, nutritious, acceptable, and varied shelf-stable foods with a shelf life of 3 - 5 years will be required to support the crew during future exploration missions to the Moon or Mars. Concurrently, the food system must efficiently balance appropriate vehicle resources such as mass, volume, water, air, waste, power, and crew time. One of the objectives during the lunar outpost missions is to test technologies that can be used during the Mars missions. This subtopic will concentrate on two specific areas; food packaging and lunar outpost food preparation and food processing. Non-Foil High Barrier Materials Development of shelf-stable food items that use high-quality ingredients is important to maintaining a healthy diet and the psychosocial well being of the crew. Shelf-life extension may be attained through new food preservation methods and/or packaging. New food packaging technologies are needed that have adequate oxygen and water barrier properties to maintain the foods' quality over a 3 - 5 year shelf life. The packaging must also minimize waste by using high barrier packaging with less mass and volume. The current flexible pouch packaging used for the thermostabilized and irradiated food items contains a layer of foil. Although the foil provides excellent oxygen and water barrier properties, it also contributes to added waste. Food packaging will be a major contributor to the trash on the lunar or Mars surface. One of the proposed methods to dispose of trash on the lunar or Mars surface is incineration. However, the foil layer will not incinerate completely and there will be ash formed. Two emerging food preservation technologies, high pressure processing and microwave processing, are being considered for future NASA missions. However, the current high barrier packaging material cannot be used for these processes. The material delaminates during high pressure processing and cannot be used in microwave processing. Hence, any food packaging material developed in response to this subtopic should be compatible with one or more of the following food preservation technologies: retort processing, microwave processing, and/or high pressure processing. In addition, the material should have an oxygen transmission rate that shall not exceed 0.06 cc/m2/24 hrs/atm and a water vapor transmission rate that shall not exceed 0.01 gm/m2/24 hrs as stated in the MIL-PRF 33073F specification. Effect of Partial Gravity and Reduced Atmospheric Pressure It will require approximately 10,000 kg of packaged food for a 6-crew, 1000 day mission to Mars. For that reason, it has been proposed to use a food system which incorporates processing of raw ingredients into edible ingredients and uses these edible ingredients in recipes in the galley to produce meals. This type of food system will require food processing and food preparation equipment. The equipment should be miniaturized, multipurpose and efficiently use vehicle resources such as mass, volume, water, and power. Food preparation may include gourmet kitchen appliances such as food processors or bread makers in addition to the standard stove and oven. Proposed food processing equipment may include a mill to produce wheat and soy flour, a soy milk/tofu processor, and a concentrator. The Moon's gravity is 1/6 of Earth's gravity. In addition, it is being proposed that the habitat will have a reduced atmospheric pressure of 8 psia which is equivalent to a 16,000 foot mountain top. These two factors will affect the heat and mass transfer during food processing and food preparation of the food. Heat transfer is required for proper microbial kill and to produce the desired texture and appearance of the food prior to consumption. At this pressure, the boiling temperature of water will be 181°F which has significant implications for preventing microbial contamination and to acceptable food quality. Prior to any design of food processing or preparation equipment, the effects of partial gravity and partial atmospheric pressure as it relates to fluid management, heat and mass transfer and chemical reactions must be determined. Once the effects are determined, methods to overcome these effects must be developed. All of this needs to happen prior to any fabrication of actual food processing or food preparation equipment that can be used in the Lunar Habitat. The response to this subtopic should include a plan to either (1) develop food packaging technologies that respond the above requirements, or (2) develop a technology which will aid in determining the effects of reduced cabin pressure and reduced gravity and/or (3) develop a technology that will enable safe and timely food processing and food preparation in reduced cabin pressure and reduced gravity. Phase 1 Requirements: Phase 1 should concentrate on the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of the proposed innovation resulting in a feasibility report and concept, complete with analyses and top-level drawings.

Exploration Systems,Topic X13 Space Radiation ,X13.01Active Charged Particle and Neutron Radiation Measurement Technologies, ARC, JSC,"The goal of the NASA Space Radiation Research Program is to assure that we can safely live and work in the space radiation environment, anywhere, any time. Space radiation is different from forms of radiation encountered on Earth. Radiation in space consists of high-energy protons, heavy ions and secondary particles created when the protons and heavy ions pass through spacecraft and human tissue. Areas of Interest: Charged particles (protons and heavy ions) and secondary radiations, such as neutrons, contribute the most significant fraction to the total dose-equivalent received by astronauts. At present, NASA has active detectors on International Space Station (ISS) that measure the microdosimetric quantities and the charge and energy spectra of the space radiation field. Neutron specific data are included as part of the microdosimetric measurements. For Exploration class missions, however, more compact and reliable active detection systems will be needed to make microdosimetric, charge, and energy measurements of the total space radiation environment. Advanced technologies (up to technology readiness level 4) are requested. Subtopic Requirements/Needs: Tissue Equivalent Microdosimeter NASA has a need for small/low-mass/low-power microdosimeter to support Exploration class missions. The microdosimeter should be capable of performing single event microdosimetric measurements of tissue equivalent volumes with simulated diameters of 1-2 micrometers. The microdosimeter should be sensitive to lineal energies of 0.2 - 1000 keV/micron. Design goals for mass and volume should be 2 kg and 2000 cm3, respectively. The microdosimeter should be able to measure charged particles and neutrons in ambient conditions in space (0.01 mGy/hr) and during a large solar particle event (100 mGy/hr). The time resolution of the lineal energy measurements should be less than or equal to 1 minute. Charged Particle Spectrometer Of particular interest are compact real-time detection systems that can measure charge and energy spectra of protons and other ions (Z = 2 to 26) and be sensitive to charged particles with LET of 0.2 to 1000 keV/mm. For Z less than 3, the spectrometer should detect energies in the range 30 MeV/n to 400 MeV/n. For Z = 3 to 26, the spectrometer should detect energies in the range 50 MeV/n to 1 GeV/n. Design goals for mass and volume should be 2 kg and 3000 cm3, respectively. The spectrometer should be able to measure charged particles at both ambient conditions in space (0.01 mGy/hr) and during a large solar particle event (100 mGy/hr). The time resolution should be less than or equal to 1 minute. The spectrometer shall be able to perform data reduction internally and provide processed data. Neutron Spectrometer Systems are needed specifically to measure the neutron component of the dose and provide the neutron dose-equivalent in real time. Of interest would be compact active monitoring devices that could measure neutron energy spectra. The principal energies of interest are neutrons from 0.5 MeV to 150 MeV. The spectrometer should be able to measure neutrons at ambient conditions such that proton/ion veto capability should be approaching 100% at solar minimum galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) rates. The spectrometer should be able to measure ambient dose equivalent of 0.02 mSv in a 1 hour measurement period, using ICRP 74 (1997) conversion factors. Design goals for mass and volume should be 5 kg and 6000 cm3, respectively. The spectrometer shall store all necessary science data and unfolding/processing algorithms shall be determined and provided for post measurement data evaluation. Phase 1 Requirements: Expected deliverable for Phase 1 is a detailed report that (1) establishes proof of concept; (2) addresses the scientific, technical and commercial merit and feasibility of the proposed technology and its relevance and significance to one or more NASA needs within the Solicitation; and (3) provides a preliminary strategy that addresses key technical, market, business factors, demonstration of the proposed innovation, and its transition into products for NASA mission programs and other potential customers.

Exploration Systems,Topic X13 Space Radiation ,X13.02Technology/Technique for Imaging Radiation Damage at the Cellular Level, JSC, JSC,"New quantitative techniques need to be developed in order to assess astronauts’ exposure to space radiation. Charged particles (protons and heavy ions) are of major concern for health risks because they cause chromosome damage. Current methods for measuring space radiation chromosome damage are time consuming and have limitations in sensitivity and accuracy. The Space Radiation Element within the Human Research Program seeks a sensitive, accurate method for assessing chromosome damage, while at the same time being less time consuming than current mFISH and mBand techniques. Subtopic Requirements/Needs: Of particular interest are ground laboratory techniques using fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect various types of chromosome damage. The technique should be able to measure charged particle exposure at both ambient conditions in space (0.005 mGy/hr) and during a large solar particle event (1000 mGy/hr). The technique should be able to detect various types of chromosome damage such as inversions and deletions in various regions of chromosomes. The technique must be able to quantify chromosome abnormalities that persist after space flight.

Exploration Systems,Topic X14 Inflight Biological Sample Preservation and Analysis ,X14.01On Orbit Ambient Biological Sample Preservation Techniques, JSC, JSC,"Measurement of blood and urine analytes is a common clinical medicine practice used for differential disease diagnosis and determination of the therapeutic response to treatment. Accurate biochemical results depend on maintaining the integrity of blood and urine samples until analyses can be completed. Improper sample collection, handling, or preservation may lead to critical errors in diagnostic interpretation of analytical results. Traditional methods have been developed that include the use of sample component separation by means of centrifugation, refrigeration, freezing or the addition of preservatives to maintain the integrity of biological samples. While such techniques are easily achieved in a routine clinical setting, the spaceflight environment presents unique challenges to sample processing and stowage. Diagnosis, treatment and research of health-related issues in human crewmembers during their confinement in the remote spaceflight environment depend on the ability to maintain the analytical integrity of biological samples. Thus, novel on-orbit methods for the ambient preservation of biological samples are critical for scientific research, monitoring of crew health and evaluation of countermeasure efficacy. The Dried Chemistry Technology developed at NASA/JSC represents one approach to the collection and preservation of in-flight blood and urine samples. Briefly, whole blood collected by venipuncture into flight-certified tubes is applied either directly to special filter cards, or alternatively, serum or plasma separated from the red cells by means of the ISS refrigerated centrifuge is applied to the filter cards. Urine samples can also be applied directly to the filter cards. The whole blood, plasma, serum, or urine filter cards are then dried and stored at ambient temperature pending analyses which may require that they be returned to Earth. Many analytes in blood and urine samples prepared and stored by means of the NASA/JSC Dried Chemistry Technology are stable for several months. The development of alternative innovative techniques with advantages over currently used methods for processing and preserving biological samples at ambient temperatures during spaceflight that provide a high level of reliability in maintaining a wide array of both blood and urine analytes over a long period of ambient stowage is highly desirable. Phase 1 Requirements: Phase 1 expectations include at a minimum a fully developed concept with feasibility analyses and top-level drawings. A breadboard or prototype is highly desirable. Read less>>"
Exploration Systems,Topic X14 Inflight Biological Sample Preservation and Analysis ,X14.02On Orbit Cell Counting and Analysis Capability, JSC, JSC,"Cell counting and analysis within the clinical hematology/immunology area generally refers to identification and enumeration of various populations of white blood cells in the peripheral blood. This capability has direct clinical relevance, as peripheral cell populations may expand (proliferation in response to pathogen, hematological malignancy) or contract (sequestered at localized site of inflammation) related to specific disease states. In medicine, the complete blood count, white blood count and CD4+ T cell counts are examples of routinely used cell counting assays. Instrumentation typically used for automated analysis includes hematology analyzers and flow cytometers. Hematology instruments generally accept unstained cells for analysis and differentiate the subpopulations based on scatter properties alone. Flow cytometers require pre-staining of specific cell surface proteins with fluorescent dyes, the emission of which will be optically detected by the cytometer upon excitation with an onboard laser. Flow cytometers may range from large, multi-laser/multi-color instruments with sorting capability, to miniaturized bench top instruments with diode lasers and less capability. NASA is interested in developing a microgravity-compatible instrument capable of on-orbit cell counting. This instrument could support medical testing of crewmembers as well as various research activities. The instrument technology is not constrained, and might range from typical cytometer fluidics, a micro fluidics approach, or some other novel method for resolving and counting cells. It is generally believed that typical sheath-fluid based cell focusing, used in standard flow cytometers, is not desirable due to microgravity incompatibility and operational constraints (fluid volume, mass and waste constraints). Extremely miniaturized and lightweight instrumentation, without high-energy lasers, and requiring minimal sample volume or exogenous (sheath) fluid to operate, and generating minimal biohazardous waste would have the greatest chance for success. An associated sample processing system may be required, that would stain, lyse or otherwise process the whole blood or cell sample is anticipated. The instrument should be capable of deriving absolute counts, in addition to the relevant percentage of various cell subpopulations. Phase 1 Requirements: Phase 1 expectations would be at a minimum a fully developed concept, complete with feasibility analyses and top-level drawings. A breadboard or prototype is highly desired.Read less>>"

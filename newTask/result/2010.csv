Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.01Antenna Technology, GRC," AFRC, GSFC, JPL, JSC, LaRC","NASA seeks advanced antenna technologies in the following areas: phased array antennas; ground-based uplink antenna array designs; large aperture deployable antennas; novel materials for next generation antennas; smart, reconfigurable antennas; and antenna concepts for harsh environments. Phased Array Antennas High performance phased array antennas are needed for high-data rate communication at Ka-Band frequencies and above as well as for remote sensing applications. Communications applications include: planetary exploration, landers, probes, rovers, EVA, suborbital vehicles, sounding rockets, balloons, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's), TDRSS communication, and expendable launch vehicles (ELV's). Also of interest are multi-band phased array antennas (e.g., X- and Ka-band) and RF/optical shared aperture dual use antennas, which can dynamically reconfigure active elements in order to operate in either band as required in order to maximize flexibility, efficiency and minimize the mass of hardware delivered to space. Phased array antennas for space-based range applications to accommodate dynamic maneuvers are also of interest. The arrays are required to be aerodynamic or conformal in shape for sounding rockets, UAV's, and expendable platforms and must be able to withstand the launch environment. Potential remote sensing applications include: radiometers, passive radar interferometer platforms, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) platforms for planetary science. Ground-based Uplink Antenna Array Designs NASA is considering arrays of ground-based antennas to increase capacity and system flexibility, to reduce reliance on large antennas and high operating costs, and eliminate single point of failure of large antennas. A large number of smaller antennas arrayed together results in a scalable, evolvable system, which enables a flexible schedule and support for more simultaneous missions. A significant challenge is the implementation of an array for transmitting (uplinking), which may or may not use the same antennas that are used for receiving. Arraying concepts that can enable a single network (i.e., DSN, NEN, and SN) at Ka-band frequencies and above are highly desired. Large Aperture Deployable Antennas Large aperture deployable antennas with surface root-mean-square (rms) quality better than λ/40 at Ka-Band frequencies and above, are desired. In addition, these antennas should significantly reduce stowage volume (packaging efficiencies as high as 50:1), provide high deployment reliability, and significantly reduced mass density (i.e., ≤1kg/m2). These large Gossamer-like antennas are required to provide high-capacity communication links with low fabrication costs from deep space (Mars and beyond). Applicability to Ka-Band or higher frequencies is required. Concepts addressing antenna adaptive beam correction with pointing control are also of interest. Novel Materials for Next Generation Antennas NASA is interested in exploiting novel materials approaches for next generation antennas. For example, “smart” materials such as shape memory polymers or ionic polymer metal composites to permit active shape control or beam correction are of interest. Artificial electromagnetic media for phase velocity control and impedance tuning to improve the efficiency and bandwidth of electrically small antennas is of interest. Ferroelectric based technologies as well as multiferroics and spintronics concepts leading to new antenna designs are desirable. Smart, Reconfigurable Antennas Smart, reconfigurable antennas for applications in planetary operations are of interest. The characteristics to consider include the frequency, polarization, and the radiation pattern. Low-cost approaches are encouraged to reduce the number of antenna apertures needed to meet the requirements associated with rovers, pressurized surface vehicles, habitats, etc. for planetary surface exploration. Desirable features include multi-beam operation to support connectivity to different communication nodes on planetary surfaces, or in support of communication links for satellite relays around planetary orbits. Innovative receiver front-ends or technologies that allow for the DSP to move closer to the antenna terminal furthering the impact of the aforementioned, revolutionary “game-changing” antenna technology concepts are highly desirable. Antenna Concepts for Harsh Environments Novel, “Game Changing”, robust antenna concepts that can perform optimally and reliably in harsh environments such as those imposed by the Lunar regolith/dust and Martian dust are highly desirable. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards Phase II hardware/software demonstration with delivery of a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase I Deliverables: A final report containing optimal design for the technology concept including feasibility of concept, and a detailed path towards Phase II hardware demonstration. The report shall also provide options for commercialization opportunities after Phase II. Phase II Deliverables: A working proof-of-concept demonstrated and delivered to NASA for testing and verification. Exit TRL 5 is expected at the end of Phase II. Read less>>"
Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.02Reconfigurable/Reprogrammable Communication Systems, GRC," AFRC, GSFC, JPL, JSC","This solicitation seeks advancements in reconfigurable transceiver and associated component technology. The goal of the subtopic is to provide flexible, reconfigurable communications capability while minimizing on-board resources and cost. Areas of interest to develop and/or demonstrate are as follows: Software/firmware for the management of waveform or functional reconfiguration. Simultaneous operation while reconfiguration takes place and an adherence to the Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) v 1.02.1 document is desired, which will soon be publicly available at https://www.spacecomm.nasa.gov/spacecomm/default.cfm Goal: Simultaneous operation while reconfiguration takes place.

Note that NASA not only seeks reconfigurable/reprogrammable communication systems for flight applications, but also for the additional capabilities reconfigurable/reprogrammable systems may add to R&D and interoperability test labs. NASA centers have varying roles, capabilities, and R&D interests/priorities. Therefore, this year’s call will also take into consideration how the products from O1.03 (Phase I, II, and III) will contribute to the current administration’s vision for NASA and its commercial and international partners, and where these products may be relevant within our collection of terrestrial labs and/or flight systems. The advancement of component technology for reconfigurable/reprogrammable communications systems is highly desirable for the insertion of these systems into space missions. Further adoption of reconfigurable/reprogrammable communications systems allow NASA science and human space flight missions to reduce risk and evolve as future requirements mature. These component technologies address either the reduction of size, weight, and power of these systems, or the costs associated with development.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.03Game Changing Technologies, GRC," ARC, JSC","NASA seeks revolutionary, highly innovative, game changing technologies that have the potential to enable order of magnitude performance improvements for space communications and navigation. Fundamental, strategic R&D is a critical element in developing innovative and superior technologies for space communication and navigation systems by addressing deficiencies in the current space communications network infrastructure to enhance performance, improve efficiency and reduce cost. Research is geared towards emphasizing research and space technologies that are far-term focused in (but not limited to) the following areas: Low SWAP Transceivers: Develop novel techniques to reduce the size, weight, and power (SWAP) requirements for communications transceivers and software-defined radios for space missions. Address SWAP challenges by addressing digital processing and logic implementation tradeoffs, static vs. dynamic power, voltage and frequency scaling, hardware and software partitioning such that operational modes are effectively managed. Use of open, interoperable standards is encouraged. Ka-band RF Devices and Components: Investigate novel RF (especially Ka-band) communications technologies and innovative approaches for high bandwidth, Ka-band devices and components (transceivers, modulators, highly efficient amplifiers, etc.). Approaches to significantly reducing size, mass, and power requirements for these components are paramount as well. High Performance Ultra Low-Power ADCs and DACs: The high power consumption and lack of flexibility to reconfigure on-the-fly make off-the-shelf analog-to digital converters (ADCs) devices ill-suited for digital radio applications. To en-able next-generation radios and support the ever-increasing user demands of high resolution (6 GSPS) and input bandwidths (2.5 GHz), breakthroughs in high-speed, low power ADCs are needed. Assume dynamically adjustable resolution up to 16 bits and on-board ultra-low jitter clock circuit to enhance spectral power distribution. A deep sleep mode feature is highly desirable to conserve power. Currently, state-of-the-art high rate digital-to-analog converters (DACs) are power prohibitive. To increase robustness, spectral efficiency, and compactness, NASA seeks to develop complementary DACs. For example, at a scant total power budget of 4 watts, ADCs and DACs will facilitate breakthroughs in S-band digital transceivers with fewer parts, smaller form factors, and greater design flexibility. Nanotechnology: High-performance, multi-functional, nano-structured materials for communications applications. Single wall carbon nano-tubes exhibit extraordinary mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties at the nano-scale level and possess exceptionally high surface area to volume ratio. The development of nano-scale communication devices and systems including nano-antennas, nano-transceivers, etc. are of interest for nano-spacecraft applications. Quantum Entanglement: Innovative breakthroughs in quantum information physics has sparked interest to specifically address this phenomenon and the critical unknowns relevant to revolutionary improvements in communicating data, information or knowledge. Methods or techniques that demonstrate extremely novel means of effectively packaging, storing, encrypting, and/or transferring information are sought. RF MEMS Integrated Components: RF micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) offer exceptional RF performance and power characteristics that can lead to dramatic advantages for novel radio applications. Such as wireless filter banks, switching matrices, and instrumentation. Although low-power, high efficiency charge pumps can be integrated into advanced communication systems that employ novel MEMS devices (e.g. switches or varactors) or circuits (e.g. tunable filters or power amplifiers), there are some long-term challenges with power handling and non-linear behavior for power levels of 1 Watt. Because high-Q varactors and filters are not well understood, NASA seeks to advance revolutionary MEMS devices and architectures that are immune to bias noise. Trans-Horizon Communications: Innovative approaches to use of medium to high frequency (300 KHz-30MHz) bands for applications benefiting future surface landing missions. Concepts, studies, development of key technologies are needed to perform non-line-of-sight communication for potential use on the surfaces of celestial bodies. For example, the lunar exosphere may have the ability to support such communications, if fully understood. Modulation and coding techniques, antennas, solid-state amplifiers, digital baseband circuitry, etc. are required to be developed and/or validated to enable over the horizon communication and communications into craters for robotic and human missions. Range of communications on the order of 10-20 kilometers at a data rate of 128 kbps is envisioned to support many of these types of surface communications links. Navigation: In adopting any proposed game-changing technologies, the capability for provision of high-quality metric tracking observables for orbit determination and other tracking services must be considered. Proposers should recognize that NASA may not be able to adopt certain game-changers in communications and navigation technology if they do not support at least NASA's current needs for metric tracking data services. Proposals in this area should document any potential performance enhancements, and especially any foreseeable compatibility issues associated with metric tracking data services. Low-Power High Stability Reference Sources: Highly stable clocks and oscillators play a pivotal role in a myriad of space communications and navigation applications. Atomic (cesium) clocks used today have time measurement accuracies on the order of 2 nanoseconds per day. New research (optical, quantum) into improving time measurement accuracy, size, reliability for space communications and navigation are of interest. Highly stable clock sources for wireless communications devices can improve network synchronization and channel selection to enhance security and anti-jamming capabilities. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase I Deliverables: Deliverables expected at the end of Phase I include trade studies, conceptual designs, simulations, analyses, reports, etc. at TRL 1-2. Phase II Deliverables: Demonstrate performance of technique or product through simulations and models, hardware or software prototypes. It is expected that at the end of the Phase II award period, the resulting deliverables/products will be at or above TRL 3. Read less>>"

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.05Long Range Space RF Telecommunications, JPL," ARC, GRC, GSFC","This solicitation seeks to develop innovative long-range RF telecommunications technologies supporting the needs of space missions. The ultimate objective is to maximize aggregate mission data return per unit mass, unit volume, unit cost and unit power consumed by the spacecraft telecommunications subsystem. In the future, spacecraft with increasingly capable instruments producing large quantities of data will be visiting the moon and the planets. To support the communication needs of these missions and maximize the data return to Earth, innovative long-range telecommunications technologies that maximize power efficiency, transmitted power density and data rate, while minimizing size, mass and power are required.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.06Space Networking, GRC," GSFC, JPL, JSC","NASA’s Space Communications and Navigation Program (SCaN) is integrating its current agency networks: Deep Space Network (DSN), Space Network (SN), TDRSS spacecraft, Near Earth Network (NEN), and future Exploration Destination networks into a single Integrated Architecture circa 2018. Technologies must be adaptable to a variety of network operating environments ranging from the long-latency limited bandwidths of deep space communications to near Earth environments with traffic flow over global partner assets and the future internet. It is also important to note that NASA systems include ground-to-ground segments in addition to space-to-ground links. Solutions must keep in mind the “big picture” and be capable of seamlessly integrating with future ground systems. Emerging space communications environments are expected to be shaped in various ways: small mobile mission clusters; traditional large spacecraft and launch vehicles; complexities of commercial and international partnering on the network and user sides; increasing threats to US space communications and navigation assets; and NASA’s need for 40% reduction in network operating costs. NASA seeks space-networking technologies, which add network intelligence and learning capabilities to increase network efficiency; provide tailored user services; reduce network operating costs through automation; and increase security and resiliency. Several technologies with promise to meet some of these challenges are listed below with their purpose current state-of--art, and performance metrics desired. Proposals should focus on one or two of these technologies, or for the more complex topics, single implementation aspects. Dynamic traffic prioritization provides a means to quickly isolate different types of traffic schemes across the space network. Current technologies allow for such features in the ground environment and the study should leverage those techniques as appropriate. The proposed approach should identify what is necessary for prioritization to be leveraged across multiple space organizations. It should also identify how decisions may impact the performance of different types of data streams. Adaptive autonomous network management is to enable smart network elements to make decisions within a predetermined playbook based upon awareness of local network conditions, policies and network end-to-end-objectives. Examples such as automated uplink/downlink scheduling have been demonstrated and are in operational use in limited circumstances. The concept is to shorten the time between a particular network anomaly and the resulting response by mission control allowing for more efficient utilization of the network. Studies must show how the shortened control loop yields better efficiency and how both conditions and automated responses are relayed back to a human operator. Cognitive networking with learning is to enable intelligent network elements to reason about reconfiguration decisions [at any layer in the protocol stack] even in unexpected conditions [whether to make decisions autonomously or to offer quantitative support to human operators] based upon situational awareness of network conditions and statistical learning about network behavior and consequences of prior interventions. Software defined and cognitive radios have been demonstrated for terrestrial use and are progressing towards broader cognitive network applications with limited and specific terrestrial demonstrations. Cognitive networking with learning is currently at the forefront of the state-of-the-art, with a multiplicity of approaches being developed for diverse applications such as Future Internet, mobile wireless, and tactical communications. Bidders are encouraged to narrow their focus to specific implementation issues in the domain and focus on adaptation for SCaN space networks. Desired performance metrics are relevant analytical estimates of potential benefits and feature cost-benefit. Enhanced security and trust management services for missions that have limited computational and power resources. Contact should not be assumed to be continuous and approaches should leverage proven security techniques where appropriate and provide a means to authenticate between assets and to provide a means to securely update network information (i.e. route injection). It will be important to identify how the proposed approach mitigates particular security risks while also remaining efficient in the space environment. Novel techniques for position determination, timing, and route computation are to provide essential services for missions that venture beyond GPS coverage and SCaN infrastructure particularly for missions limited in equipage they can carry or in the face of intentional service disruption. Human missions develop positional uncertainty at a rate of 10 km/hr due to random accelerations. Early lunar missions like LRO are without timing service. Route computation requirements emerge with formation flight, delta-V sensitive libration point and planetary highway orbits, and robotic surface exploration. [Metrics: convergence time, overhead (number of bytes used by routing algorithm to reach steady state)]. For more information on NASA's future space communication plans, please see the Space Communications and Navigation website at https://www.spacecomm.nasa.gov/ Performance metrics are listed by technology above. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards Phase II hardware/software demonstration with delivery of a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase I Deliverables: Phase I report will analytically demonstrate technical feasibility of one or more space networking technologies identified above by characterizing: Technical requirements flow-down from generic objectives and summary of state-of-the-art to SCaN network-specific requirements on key performance metrics Identification of specific technical challenges to implementation for SCaN networks.

Space Operations,Topic O2 Space Transportation ,O2.01Secondary/Auxiliary Payload-to-Launch Vehicle Interface Technologies, KSC, AFRC,"This subtopic includes two major technology areas: (1) Small payload standard interface technologies (SPSIT) (2) Entry and ascent experimental platform technologies (EAEPT) Proposals will be accepted for either area. Many expendable launch vehicle (ELV) launches do so with excess capacity. The utilization of specific excess volumes within a launch system must be accomplished at a low cost with minimal to no additional risk to the primary payload or launch vehicle. This subtopic seeks to develop commercial solutions that will allow and encourage new enabling launch capabilities and standardization of key payload-to-launch vehicle processes and interface standards with the goal of producing a low cost, low risk plat-form or process for integrating secondary or auxiliary payloads on existing NASA ELV launches. The goal is to develop new launch vehicle capabilities such as adapters/platforms, processes, and/or avionics interface standards that can be collectively used to:Minimize integration tasks and/or duration of integration efforts to install secondary/auxiliary payloads onto NASA ELV launches Facilitate secondary/auxiliary spacecraft and subsystem design while reducing testing duration and complexity Impose no additional risk to the primary mission Enable novel mission concepts for secondary/auxiliary payloads Small Payload Standard Interface Technologies Currently, the Poly-Picosatellite Orbital Deployer (PPOD) provides a cost-efficient standard interface and deployment system for CubeSats in the 1 to 3 kg mass range. In addition, the Evolved ELV (EELV) Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) provides a standard structural interface for secondary payloads up to180kg and is designed for interface into Atlas V and Delta IV launch vehicles. A smaller version of the ESPA ring has been conceptualized for smaller launch vehicles. Both the ESPA and the small ESPA are most cost effective when they accommodate 6 payloads. In addition, for the most part, the avionics and electrical power interfaces are unique to each launch vehicle fleet. This subtopic seeks to develop commercial solutions that could allow the cost effective launch of one or more secondary/auxiliary payloads via an interface (structural, avionics and electrical) that is standard or expandable/upgradable to be compatible with the maximum number of domestic launch vehicles. NASA currently has Pegasus XL, Taurus XL, Falcon 1, Falcon 9, Atlas V and Delta IV on contract. A significant fraction of mission costs are typically unique designs and approaches to perform relatively routine functions such as launch accommodations and subsystem-to-subsystem interface and communications. By standardizing many of these approaches, spacecraft and payload developers can design their systems with an expectation of a predictable, low-cost integration flow. Launch service providers can mitigate mission risk through the use of predictable and proven interfaces standardized to streamline analytical/physical integration processes and test flows. This subtopic will focus on new interfaces for payloads in the mass range of 3 to 180 kg, which can be grouped as needed for any modularization concepts. A range of 11 to 100 kg has been specifically identified as a region where critical technology demonstrations and new space technologies could use affordable orbital launch opportunities to increase their TRL, potentially reducing their overall cost and risk to development. Enabling affordable launch capabilities in these ranges could also allow scientific and educational spacecraft (s/c) developers the ability to design to a specific mass range that will result in on-orbit research. The technologies in this subtopic are highly desirable because although adapters that could support most missions exist, having multiple systems across multiple launch vehicles fleets will contribute to higher integration costs. Standards amongst the s/c and adapter community will reduce integration cost and therefore the per-kilogram cost-to-orbit. Areas of interest (SPSIT):Launch adapters and systems and associated spacecraft standards Standardized spacecraft and/or payload integration test flows, processes and qualification techniques Standardized electrical interfaces, sometimes known as plug and play electrical power and data bus standards for streamlined subsystem integration.The critical requirement for all areas of interest identified above is that the design, integration or implementation shall not increase base line risk to the primary spacecraft or the launch vehicle mission success. Implementation of the above enables support for any upcoming missions needing the capability to demonstrate new technology on-orbit by using a standard interface or process. Phase I Deliverables (SPSIT):Assessments of current and future spacecraft/mission/space technologies in the mass ranges will identify current adapter systems, processes and determine the TRL for each system within 3 year timeframe from award date Develop draft standards for both spacecraft, adapter, integration process and avionics interfacesAt the completion of phase I, the goal is to have achieved a TRL 3 or better for the adapter systems and processes Phase II Deliverables (SPSIT):Finalize standards within the mass range Complete adapter hardware designs ""Plug-n-play"" avionics standards hardware/software Conduct PDR and CDR of new technologies Finalize standards for the integration processHigher TRL levels at the completion of Phase II will increase the likelihood of a path for infusion into NASA missions. Entry and Ascent Experimental Platform Technologies Current launch capabilities for aerodynamic and hypersonic research are limited to either high cost launches as a primary payload on a launch vehicle, or small packages (typical sounding rocket payload volume and mass ~ 10 ft3, 300 lbm). Sounding rockets that provide the technology testing capabilities are also limited in the altitude and the speeds they can achieve. Therefore, the conceptual design for a new platform is being sought to fill the technology-testing gap. For example, if the vehicle configuration had spare solid rocket motor capacity, this experimental platform could launch as a secondary payload, by occupying the location of a solid rocket motor on a launch vehicle such as the Atlas V or Delta IV. The new experimental platform would provide expanded testing capabilities to accommodate payloads with larger (2-10 times) size and weight, obtaining greater altitudes and speeds than currently provided using sounding rockets. The platform would pro-vide an affordable way to demonstrate and test new technologies through hypersonic, intra-atmospheric, and reentry phases. The launch vehicle can be any vehicle used by NASA (currently, Pegasus XL, Taurus XL, Falcon 1, Falcon 9, Atlas V and Delta IV are on contract) and must be integrated onto the first stage of a vehicle per the areas of interest listed in Areas of interest section below. Usage of this experimental platform could support development of a number of advanced technologies through flight-testing in representative environments, where their TRL could be validated and advanced.

Space Operations,Topic O2 Space Transportation ,O2.03Spaceport Enhancement & Improvements, GSFC," AFRC, GRC, KSC","The key operating characteristics for a Spaceport focus are interoperability, ease of use, flexibility, safety/environmental protection, and multiple concurrent operations. The long-term vision is to have ""airport-like"" spaceport operations. Therefore, the development of effective spaceport technologies is of primary importance to NASA. These technologies will need to support both the existing and future vehicles and programs. Space-Based Telemetry NASA is seeking to reduce or eliminate the need for redundant range assets and deployed down-range assets that are currently used to provide for Line-of-Sight (LOS) Tracking Telemetry and Control (TT&C) with sub-orbital platforms and orbit-insertion launch vehicles. There are varying applications for space-based transceivers, each necessitating a different set of requirements. The desired focus is very low size, weight, and power (SWaP), tactical grade, highly reliable, and easily reconfigurable transceivers capable of establishing and maintaining unbroken satellite communication links for telemetry and/or control. This technology will serve applications, which include low-cost sub-orbital missions, secondary communications systems for orbit insertion vehicles, low cost and size orbital payloads (typically LEO), and flight test articles. Durations will range from minutes to several weeks and the ability to operate on highly dynamic platforms is critical. High data rate links are highly desired, thus the use of NASA's TDRSS is emphasized, although other commercial satellite systems, which can provide nearly global and high data rate links can also be explored. Factors to address include:Advancements in software based radios and encoding techniques, Use of the latest semiconductor technologies (GaN or other), Advanced heat dissipation techniques, Immunity to corona breakdown, Ease of data interfacing.RF power output requirements range from a few watts to as high as 100 W. Special consideration should be given to transceiver capability vs. packaging that would allow for customizable configurations depending on the target application. Range Weather NASA seeks innovative technologies to remotely measure electric fields aloft to reduce the threat of destruction of a launch vehicle by rocket triggered lightning. Potential candidate technologies include new algorithms to take advantage of existing dual-polarized Doppler five-cm weather radar capability, or entirely new technologies for the remote sensing of electric fields. The ability to economically measure the incremental ballistic wind velocities along the predicted trajectory of launch vehicles at remote and evolving launch ranges at altitude up to 100 kft via fixed and mobile LIDAR approaches is also highly desirable. The above technologies are considered to be highly desirable for NASA's objectives and critical for the realization of true Spaceports. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase I Deliverables: A final report containing optimal design for the technology concept including feasibility of concept, detailed path towards Phase II hardware and software demonstration, and detailed results of Phase I analysis, modeling, prototyping, and testing.

Space Operations,Topic O2 Space Transportation ,O2.04Advanced Composite Tank and Materials Technologies, MSFC," GRC, LaRC","This subtopic includes two major technology areas: (1) Reusable, Reliable and Low Cost Composite Tanks (2) Advanced Material Integration Technology Development Proposals will be accepted for either area. Reusable, Reliable and Low Cost Composite Propellant Tanks (RRLCCPT) The objective of this subtopic is to help dramatically reduce the cost to low Earth orbit by advancing the technology involved in composite propellant tanks and advanced composite material development. The ability for launch vehicles to combine the significant weight savings of composite tanks with airline like operations could be possible if these tanks are also reusable, reliable, and need little to no maintenance between flights. Purpose and Current State-of-the-Art: Composite tanks offer significant weight savings, but there are significant shortfalls in terms of reusability, especially when using cryogenic fluids. This lack of reusability severely hampers adoption of this enabling technology in future reusable vehicle. This subtopic will also address emerging composite tank technologies, specifically in the areas of testing and verification pertaining to damage tolerance, safe-life and checkout. General Operational Needs and Requirements/ Performance Metrics: Airline-like Operations Government and commercial reusable launch vehicles are only economically viable if they can achieve high flight rates of dozens of flights per year or more per vehicle. These flight rates themselves are only possible if something akin to airline like operations becomes possible for spaceflight. Reusability and Reliability Reusable, reliable, and low cost composite tanks that need little to no maintenance between flights and minimal check-out are required for economic and operational sustainability. These developments can:Ease operability of the tank diagnostics Enable tank prognostics Enable tanks to handle high pressure cycles and loads without leaking or developing structural failure Promote ease of manufacture, and by more than one American company Promote ease of repair without returning tanks to the manufacturer's facility Promote rapid certification/recertification techniques to meet expected FAA commercial RLV requirements Data and Technology Development Of specific concern and interest are safe-life and damage tolerance testing. There is much scrutiny regarding the manner and degree of testing in these areas, specifically after some number of pressure cycles. Also of concern is the effect of temperature on and during cycling and material compatibility. Due to the limited amount of flight and long term performance data there is little to base future design on when the desire is heritage similarity. Thus, development in regards to these specific metrics (safe-life and damage tolerance testing) would be most beneficial to both short and long term missions. The outcome of this portion of the SBIR is expected to be technologies and data that make possible composite propellant tanks that have improved reliability and performance that will enable a high degree of reusability. Data should show that proper material, manufacturing processes and design are used to produce a vessel that per-forms well under long-term use in a cryogenic condition. The vessel would minimize microcracking, should be damage tolerant and repairable, and have mounting capabilities. For the proposed technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware demonstration and testing. Delivery of a demonstration unit for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract is also required. Phase I Deliverables (RRLCCPT): Final report containing:Optimal design and feasibility of concept, Detailed path towards Phase II demonstration, Detailed results of Phase I analysis, modeling, prototyping and development testing Material coupon data and a prototype sub-scale tankDesired deliverables at the end of Phase I should be at TRL 3-4 Phase II Deliverables (RRLCCPT): By the end of Phase II, working proof-of-concept technologies, including features and demonstration of long term, high cycle performance at cryogenic temperatures, demonstrated and delivered to NASA for testing and verification. Deliverables expected at the end of Phase II should be at TRL 5-6. Advanced Material Integration Technology Development (AMITD) Advanced materials including ceramic composites and metallic materials, will require technologies that will allow joining of these materials, specifically the development of advanced joining and integration technologies with enhanced temperature and performance capability. Typical materials are carbon and silicon carbide based composites and super alloys. The quality of joined sub-elements should also be evaluated nondestructively to assess the integrity and quality of the joints. Material systems may be similar or dissimilar in nature (composite to metals or composite to composites). Purpose and Current State-of-the-Art: Currently the most commonly used fabrication approaches (CMC, CVI and PIP) have severe limitations in terms of size and shape of CMC components that can be manufactured with appropriate property attributes and a reasonable cost. Therefore, current design considerations for the manufacturing of large CMC components and structures will be utilizing technologies for joining/attaching smaller-sized components with simpler geometries and dissimilar material systems. General Operational Needs and Requirements: Ceramic joining and integration is an enabling technology for the successful implementation of CMC's in a wide variety of high temperature applications. Among the various alternatives available to overcome the limitations of the many fabrication technologies for the manufacture of large CMC components and structures of complex shape, the joining of smaller components with simple geometry appears to be the most promising and practical. Application of simple equipments for curing and during the high temperature joining process is critical. Requirements include, but are not limited to:Materials to be joined are silicon carbide or carbon-based matrix fiber reinforced composites to a similar CMC or high temperature metallic alloy Proposed joining approach should be robust and able to produce joints with tailorable microstructures Thermo-mechanical properties of the joint interlayer should be tailorable and close to those of the base materials Proposed technologies are expected to be easy to apply in a manufacturing environment at high technology readiness levels For CMC-CMC joining, the joint interlayer material should be able to yield ceramic interlayers with temperature capability similar or better than the substrate materials with low porosityPerformance Metrics: The temperature capability of the ceramic joints in joined CMC should be similar to that of the CMC substrate materials. The chemical composition of the joints should not alter the stress rupture, creep, high temperature mechanical strength, and stiffness of the overall system in any significant manner. The environmental stability, time dependent mechanical properties, and performance of the joints should not be significantly different than the substrate materials. For the proposed technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II sub-element and subcomponent development and testing. Delivery of a subcomponent demonstration unit for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract is also required. Phase I Deliverables (AMITD): Develop and demonstrate a robust joining concept, understand common test methods for joint testing, and assess the interfacial microstructure and mechanical properties of joints. Assess high temperature durability of joints and effect of joint design on thermo mechanical performance. Desired deliverables at the end of Phase I should be at TRL 3-4. Phase II Deliverables (AMITD): Produce and test additional joint prototypes (sub-elements and subcomponents) under representative flight conditions to include anticipated temperatures, heat fluxes, thermal gradients, and environmental effects. Full macro-structural and micro-structural material characterization of joints before and after testing will be required to assess life-limiting failure mechanisms and joint reliability. Provide joined CMC subcomponents or segmented structures with a method to non-destructively evaluate the joint quality. Deliverables expected at the end of Phase II should be at TRL 5. Read less>>"

This subtopic requests innovative proposals in the following areas:Technologies and systems offering a factor of two or greater reduction in maintenance time and costs Reusable space transportation vehicles being developed for Earth to orbit access and return, In-space transportation systems using aero-braking and aero-capture, and On-demand payload and crew return systems Multi-use and reusable TPS concepts applicable for insulated composite and metallic vehicle structures With improved robustness Reduced and/or automated inspection, repair and recertification, While remaining weight competitive to current flight proven TPS TPS non-destructive evaluation techniques and new health management approaches and strategies Rapid TPS inspection, repair, and flight certifications techniques Designs and concepts for new TPS attachment methods, Designs for gaps and joints TPS designs for control surfaces and interfacesPhase I Deliverables: Phase I deliverables include a final report detailing optimal design for the technology concept, including a feasibility assessment and summary of analysis, modeling and any prototype development and testing.

Space Operations,Topic O3 Processing and Operations ,O3.01Mission Operations, ARC, JPL,"The objective is to develop advanced capability software systems for mission operations in support of NASAs Space Communications Infrastructure. The current infrastructure for NASA Space Communications provides services for near-Earth spacecraft and deep space planetary missions. The infrastructure assets include the Deep Space Network (DSN), the Ground Network (GN), and the Space Network (SN). NASA seeks automation technologies that will facilitate scheduling of oversubscribed communications resources. These capabilities should focus on the development of user interfaces and algorithms for the integration of diagnostic and situational awareness tools; and planning, scheduling, and resource optimization tools supporting: Increased numbers of missions and customers Increased number and complexity of constraints Decreased operations budgets Scheduling algorithms should be fault-tolerant Current State-of-the-Art: Diagnosis software tools and resource optimization tools are mature independent software technologies, however the integration of the two is less mature. The challenge is to develop integrated software tools that can leverage the strengths of each class of tool. Diagnosis tools must inform the resource optimization algorithms of the active portions of the system, while the resource optimization tools must inform the diagnosis tools of the current plan in order to facilitate tracking of system state. User Interfaces: Diagnosis software user interfaces rely on displaying diagnostic information either in fault tree form or spatially highlighting portions of schematics, which are suspect. On the other hand, planning/scheduling/resource optimization tools rely on the display of temporal information in Gantt charts, and other timeline-based methods. An integrated user interface would require the integration of the spatial and temporal information into a single display to facilitate the ease of use and understanding of the integrated tools. Diagnosis and Situational Awareness: Space Communication Networks are complex systems made up of both physical and wireless connections. When faults occur in the network, isolating the faults in real-time is critical in order to maintain network capability. Model-based diagnostic systems are capable of modeling the connectivity of the system as well as propagating both nominal and off-nominal flow of information in the network. These systems can accurately characterize the state of the system in order to provide situational awareness for both humans as well as intelligent assistant and resource optimization tools. The utilization of the current state of the network is critical to reschedule resources that have failed or degraded. Planning and Scheduling Tools for Resource Optimization: The goal of schedule optimization is to produce allocations that yield the best objectives. These may include maximizing DSN utilization, minimizing loss of desired tracking time, and optimizing project satisfaction. Each project may have their own definition of satisfaction such as maximal science data returned, maximal tracking time, best allocation of the day/week, etc. The difficulty is that we may not satisfy all of these objectives during the optimization process. Obviously, optimal solution for one objective may produce worse results for the other objectives. One possible solution is to map all of these objectives to an overall system goal. This mapping is normally non-linear. Technology needs to be developed for this non-linear mapping for scoring in addition to regular optimization approaches. Areas of Interest: Integrated diagnosis and resource optimization tools are useful in different phases in the design and development of space communication networks. In early pre-planning phases of mission operations such tools are useful for: procedure development, contingency development, and other preparatory tasks. During the operations phase, such tools are useful for telemetry analysis; fault diagnosis, state determination and situational assessment; plan, procedure, and rules revisions and execution; decision-making; commanding; fault responses; and data management among others. NASA seeks proposals to develop the following capabilities in support of human situational awareness: Methods for acquiring, evaluating, and displaying telemetric information, so as to provide users with flexibility and easy access to desired information in desired format. Methods to determine situational information from multiple data sources, possibly noisy and incomplete, and present those to the user; Methods to track actions of other users or systems, including automated systems, and keep user aware of the situation. Methods to track user intent and provide the appropriate situational information; Methods for controlling the degree of automated/manual control, and tools for transitioning control between user and automation with minimal loss of context and situational awareness. Methods for creating, validating, evaluating, and revising model-based diagnostics models, taking into account collaborative aspects and reference materials required to build models (architecture diagrams/schematics, sensor definitions, fault modes, configurations and other reference materials). Techniques for checking or simulating model-based diagnostic models, in order to acquire a level of trust or assurance that the model is correct with respect to the configuration of the network. Methods for creating, validating, evaluating, and revising operations plans, taking into account collaborative aspects, complex flight rules, resource limitations and need for one-time constraints and exceptions. Techniques for checking or simulating plans, procedures, sequences and other combinations of commands and actions, in order to acquire a level of trust or assurance that the combination is correct and will satisfy desired safety and operations properties in actual execution Methods to change the planning/scheduling optimization functions to incorporate high priority requests. Performance metrics: Measures of performance will compare human generated results vs. human/computer results for nominal and off-nominal network conditions. Experiments should be run on simulated communications test-bed(s), which can seed failures of different classes at different points in time. Schedule quality will be determined by a number of factors including: (1) level of up time on the network, (2) degree of priority allocation (higher priority items scheduled first), (3) degree of contiguity allocation (items are scheduled as a group) and (4) other factors. For the proposed technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware demonstration and testing. Delivery of a demonstration unit for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract is also required. Phase I Deliverables: Propose demonstration of integrated fault diagnosis/resource optimization tool on a number of communication asset allocation problem sets (involving dozens of missions, communications assets, and operational constraints). End Phase deliverable (TRL 4-5) would include a detailed rationale for technology return-on-investment (ROI) based on knowledge of current and future operations flows. Phase II Deliverables: A demonstration of the integrated fault diagnosis/resource optimization tool with fault diagnosis/situational awareness system on actual or surrogate communication asset scheduling datasets. Deliverables (TRL 6) would include software system, use cases and evidence of utility of deployment of developed technology.Read less>>"
Space Operations,Topic O3 Processing and Operations ,O3.02ISS Utilization, JSC," ARC, GRC, KSC, MSFC","NASA is investigating the near- and mid-term development of highly-desirable systems and technologies that provide innovative ways either to leverage existing ISS facilities for new scientific payloads or, to provide on orbit analysis to enhance capabilities and reduce sample return requirements. Current utilization of the ISS is limited by available upmass, downmass, and crew time as well as by the capabilities of the interfaces and hardware already developed. Innovative interfaces between existing hardware and systems which are common to ground research could facilitate both increased, and faster, payload development. Desired capabilities include, but are not limited to, the below examples. Enabling additional cell and molecular biology culture techniques. Providing innovative hardware to allow for safe, contained transfer of cells from container to container within the Microgravity Sciences Glove Box (MSG) would permit new types of studies on ISS. On orbit analysis techniques that would reduce or remove the need for downmass - such as a system for gene array tests, or kits for DNA extractions for long term storage - are also examples of hardware possibilities that would extend and enable additional research. Providing compact Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) hardware. Development of a compact robust DLS instrument based on diode lasers and photo detectors capable of providing significant power and weight savings would make it possible to measure the diffusion coefficient of experimental systems using the Light Microscopy Module (LMM). This peer-reviewed science was considered a decade ago but not developed due to technology limitations. It should now be possible to measure diffusion coefficients from which the molecular temperature of the location being viewed could be deduced for known particles and solvents using the Stokes-Einstein equation. Innovative additions of a local oscillator used in conjunction with analog detectors could mitigate errors introduced by stray light. Providing compact laser tweezers and supporting software. Development of a compact robust Holographic Laser Tweezers (LT) instrument based on the recent developments of holographic techniques could expand the types of experiments conducted on orbit. This peer-reviewed science was previously considered but not developed because of the size and technology limitations of a decade ago. LT holds open the possibility of performing scientific experiments that manipulate groups of particles that evolve uniquely in space when gravitational sedimentation and jamming no longer exist. Any new LT and its corresponding control software should allow for tracking of particle positions in 3D (before the concentration becomes too high) and impart rotational forces. Being able to accurately track the position of particles while measuring the forces on them is important for laying the foundations of colloidal engineering. Novel self-calibration methods could be added to commercially available designs to further enhance the instrument and its capabilities. The instrument would need to meet the size and volume limitations of the Light Microscopy Module (LMM). Providing additional on-orbit analytical tools. Providing flight qualified hardware that is similar to commonly used tools in biological laboratories could allow for an increased capacity of on-orbit analysis thereby reducing the number of samples which must be returned to Earth. Examples of tools that will reduce downmass or expand on-orbit analysis include: sample handling tools; mass measurement devices; a (micro)plate reader; a mass spectrometer; non-cryogenic sample preservation systems; autonomous in-situ bioanalytical technologies; centrifuges for analysis and for providing fractional-g environments; microbial and cell detection and identification systems; and fluidics and microfluidics systems to allow autonomous on-orbit experimentation and high throughput screening. Providing Nanorack compatible inserts to enable additional life science payloads. Development of 1, 2 and/or 4 cube design biological payload hardware for use with the ISS Nanorack platform would decrease the need for development of multiple control racks and reduce development time of future payload experiments. Enabling additional payloads. Innovative methods for further subdividing payloads lockers would allow for numerous pico-payloads. Developing multi-generational or multi-use habitats would reduce the upmass and downmass required to conduct biological experiments on ISS. The existing hardware suite and interfaces available on ISS may be found at:http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/Discipline.html For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.

Space Operations,Topic O3 Processing and Operations ,O3.04Vehicle Integration and Ground Processing, KSC," MSFC, SSC","This subtopic seeks to create new and innovative technology solutions, which improve safety and lower the life cycle costs of assembly, test, integration and processing of the ground and flight assets at our nations spaceports and propulsion test facilities. Current State of the Art: The propulsion testing and launch vehicle processing activities at NASA account for a large portion of the life cycle costs of todays space programs. The technologies in use today at these facilities date back to the beginnings of manned space flight. A majority of the test infrastructure at Stennis Space Center and launch processing facilities at Kennedy Space Center indeed go back to the Apollo era and early shuttle design days of the 1960s and early 70s. Technology solutions typically take 3-6 years from inception in the SBIR Phase I program to having a direct impact on the processing activity. NASA needs to invest in these vehicle integration and ground-processing technology needs now to be in place for the NASA heavy launch vehicle concepts of the future. Propellant servicing operation for both propulsion testing and launch operations are in need of technology advancement to make these operations safer and more cost efficient. The hardware and practices in use today do indeed date back to 1960s investments. Technology solutions are needed to increase visibility into processes real-time (smart instrumentation), more efficient cryogenic propellant storage solutions, a new generation of cryogenic couplings to allow cold mate and de-mate operations without ice or frost buildup, and to reduce our usage of massive amounts of gaseous helium (a scarce, non-renewable global resource). Changes in environmental regulations have had a tremendous negative impact on the coatings used to protect our NASA test and launch infrastructure. Many of the coatings used in the last 10 years are no longer available due to changes in the environmental law banning the use of certain chemicals. KSC and SSC are located in some of the worst corrosion environments in the country. At KSC, the addition of the acidic exhaust plumes from solid rocket motors, make these conditions even worse. New advancements in coatings and materials are needed to reduce the infrastructure maintenance costs of these facilities. Due to the lightweight, high strength properties, composite materials are being sought more often to solve weight reduction efforts on future launch vehicles. New materials mean new problems for the ground operations team charged with insuring these vehicles are safe to fly. New inspection tools are needed to confirm structural integrity during the processing flow after field repairs or accidental contact. The following areas are of particular interest:Propellant Servicing Technologies Technologies for advanced, energy efficient cryogenic fluid storage, transfer and propellant servicing of launch vehicles and propulsion test facilities. These efforts include: Cost effective technology solutions to support helium facility supply infrastructure and helium conservation initiatives to reduce/eliminate helium usage during LH2 and LO2 system operations and recover /re-purify helium from large volume waste streams; Techniques and technologies to reduce parasitic heat loads in large cryogenic storage tank structural design to enable more economical zero boil-off storage concepts; Advances in smart instrumentation for in-situ fluid flow analysis and process control, surviving and operating under cryogenic and launch conditions to enable real-time monitoring of propellant servicing processes and high efficiency purging operations of cryogenic systems; and Non-frosting/icing quick-disconnect development to support cryogenic propellant servicing operations. Control of Material Degradation Technologies are needed for the prediction, prevention, detection and mitigation of corrosion/erosion in spaceport and propulsion test facility infrastructure and ground support equipment including steel refractory concrete. Material solutions must meet current and emerging environmental restrictions and endure todays corrosive and highly acidic launch environments. These needs include: Methodology to predict long-term corrosion protection performance of coatings for steel operating in a marine environment; Damage responsive coatings with corrosion inhibitors; Replacement options for poor-performing refractory concrete exhibiting low temperature cure characteristics or means of providing large area coverage with modular units that can be cured off site; Protective coatings for non-painted surfaces; Innovations in thermal spray metallic coatings equipment and alloys; Non-chrome protective coatings/sealants for aluminum alloys; and New environmentally friendly protective coating options to replace products lost due to EPA regulation changes. Spaceport Processing Evaluation/Inspection Tools Technologies in support of defect detection in composite materials; methods for determining structural integrity of composite materials and bonded assemblies; and non-intrusive inspection of Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPV), Orion heat shield and other composite systems. Technologies must support identifying composite material defects, evaluating material integrity, damage inspection and/or acceptance testing of composite systems. Technology solutions are also desired for in-situ evaluation of refractory concrete as installed in the flame trenches associated with propulsion test and launch pad infrastructure. Provide solutions that reduce inspection times, provide higher confidence in system reliability, increase safety and lower life cycle costs. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase I Deliverables: Demonstration of technical feasibility (TRL 2-4).

Space Operations,Topic O3 Processing and Operations ,O3.05Advanced Motion Imaging, MSFC, JSC,"Digital motion imaging technologies provide great improvements over analog systems, but also present significant challenges, including radiation damage to sensor systems and components. Cameras and sensors need to survive operations on orbit for years without debilitating radiation damage that degrades image quality and performance. The focus of this subtopic is the development of components, systems, and core technologies that advance the capabilities to capture process and distribute high-resolution digital motion imagery. Current State of the Art: HDTV cameras flown on the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station have proven to be highly susceptible to damage from ionizing radiation. This damage is manifested by bad pixels that eventually render the camera useless after short periods of on-orbit use, usually less than one year. In addition, upmass and downmass constraints make the use of large format motion picture film cameras impractical, so a digital equivalent is needed for large venue documentary film productions, such as IMAX films. Areas of interest in the near term are for space environment, radiation tolerant, HDTV and digital cinema cameras and sensors. Mid and Long term goals include radiation tolerant reprogrammable encoders and improved distribution systems for video data signals. These systems are highly desired by the human spaceflight programs. Technologies are sought that provide high resolution, progressively scanned motion imagery with limited or mitigated radiation damage to sensors, are viable for astronaut hand-held applications or external spacecraft use, and that provide imagery that meets standards commonly used by digital television or digital cinema production facilities. Commercial HDTV cameras used for internal hand-held use have generally been small and light (5 x 6 x 11, between 2 and 3 pounds), run off rechargeable batteries, and utilize standard lens mounts. Future cameras for exterior applications ideally would be smaller and more modular in design (no larger than 4 x 5 x 7 and 2.5 pounds). The critical technology need is the radiation tolerance of the sensor, not the size, weight and mass of the camera that results from such a sensor. While commercial HDTV and Digital Cinema cameras for use on Earth are mature technologies, there are no flight-proven radiation tolerant HDTV and Digital Cinema cameras and sensors currently available. Commercial cameras flown on the Shuttle and ISS thus far do function, but degrade within a year on orbit. While hard to classify, the current TRL for these cameras within the context of spaceflight operations could be considered to be a 5 or 6. The ultimate goal is to develop radiation-hardened camera sensors capable of surviving three or more years in space. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase I Deliverables: Deliverables for Phase I will include detailed designs and development plans with plausible data and rationale that demonstrates why the designs and plans should mitigate radiation effects on the sensors. Phase II Deliverables: Deliverables for Phase II will include developmental hardware suitable for testing in a lab or space flight environment (TRL 6) as well as a test plan, relevant data, and define expected lifespan of the sensors.Read less>>"

Each SLM survey session takes 2 hours of crew time, and the survey is per-formed once every 2 months, thus reduced crew time needed will be an important benefit. Because of the length of the survey, only a portion of the ISS can be measured during a single session. Similarly, acoustic dosimetry at fixed locations is performed once every 2 months, but only at three locations for each session because of crew-time and hardware limitations. Advanced acoustic monitoring technology will provide the capability to allow for more frequent and directed acoustic measurements and will allow nighttime measurements. These benefits will permit more precise trending, environmental monitoring and will provide a better validation of acoustic models, i.e., we will be able to isolate the impacts of various operations or pieces of hardware. Areas of interest: Current automated acoustic monitoring methods used in ground-based systems perform measurements in isolated areas, e.g., around airports. However, the technology employed is large and heavy, using conventional data acquisition boards, transducers, and transmitters. NASA seeks proposals for acoustic monitors for spaceflight vehicle applications that: Are miniaturized, Are lightweight, Integrate data acquisition, sampling, and processing into the sensor Transmit the processed data wirelessly, Low-power consumption Can be a part of a multi-sensor system The functional SLM goal is to provide average sound pressure level measurements over a short time duration (e.g. 20 seconds) as a function of frequency. The functionality required includes: Type II measurement accuracy over the octave band frequency range from 63 Hz to 20 kHz, Dynamic range of 90 dB or better, 1/3 octave band frequency representation, Narrow band frequency representation with selectable frequency resolution. The following SLM functionality is desired: Type I measurement accuracy over the octave band frequency range from 63 Hz to 20 kHz, Octave band noise floor of 10 dB re 20 micropascals Fractional octave (1/1, 1/3, 1/12) band frequency representation. The functional Acoustic Dosimeter goal is to provide noise exposure levels and data logging, i.e., log of sound levels as a function of time. The functionality required includes: Type III accuracy over the audible frequency range, Logging of A-weighted Overall Sound Pressure Levels every 30 seconds for a period of 24-hours, Dynamic range of 90 dB or better. The following Acoustic Dosimeter functionality is desired: Noise floor of 30 dB re 20 micropascals. The goal for the hazard level alert functionality is to provide continuous acoustic monitoring with logic that sends a signal (to trigger a non-auditory alert) if hazardous noise levels of 85 dBA and above are detected. This is a new crew-health related function that will reduce the crews risk for exposure to high noise levels, and will protect the crew in the case of an off-nominal noise event. The functionality desired includes: Perform continuous acoustic data sampling Send an electronic signal if noise levels are 85 dBA or above The following hazard level alert functionality is desired: Pre-trigger capability so onset of hazardous noise is measured. The technology from this SBIR subtopic is highly desired for use on ISS and for future long duration space missions for the long-term. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. For Phase II, a demonstration in the JSC Acoustics and Noise Control Lab (ANCL) is being requested so that testing can be performed in the ISS Acoustic Mockup. As a result, an SBIR testing facility waiver will be needed. Potential Phase III activities are envisioned to be a demonstration of the sensors capability on board ISS as a Station Detailed Test Objective (SDTO) Phase I Deliverables: Sensor preliminary design Breadboard microphone transducer (proof of concept) Test data showing acoustic performance of breadboard sensor Forward plan for sensor development, including plans for in-situ calibration The expected TRL at the end of Phase I is 3-5 Phase II Deliverables: Sensor design in flight-like package Test data showing acoustic performance of flight-like sensor Demonstration of multiple sensors in ground facility (NASA JSC ANCL) The expected TRL at the end of Phase II should be 6.

Space Operations,Topic O3 Processing and Operations ,O3.07Cryogenic Fluid Management Technologies, KSC," ARC, GRC","The ultimate objective of this Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM) Technologies solicitation is to demonstrate a variety of critical CFM technologies in a micro-gravity space environment via a deployable or non-deployable test bed. The initial phase (Phase I) will identify and develop prototype experiments that could be integrated into a universal platform for demonstration of these experiments in their relevant micro-gravity environment. The second phase (Phase II) of this solicitation would develop a universal and innovative test bed platform that could be launched as a secondary payload on an expendable launch vehicle. State of the art: CFM technologies are, for the most part, limited to ground tests that do not provide a complete and accurate demonstration of the technologies in their true operational environment. This increases risk in the development of emerging technologies for future applications in the areas of space based propellant depots, low gravity descent and ascent operations, and future space or planetary based architectures. Areas of interest: The purpose of these experiments would be to allow testing of: Designs for fluid and propellant transfer plumbing Multi-layer insulation (MLI) designs Various mass gauging designs Thermal control and boil-off control designs in a true micro-gravity space environment Sample technologies in current queue at NASA centers that require testing in such type of platform include: Vapor Cooling Orientation Para-ortho H2 conversion Fluid Transfer Coupling Thermodynamic Vent System Automated Rendezvous and Docking Thick MLI blanket Broad area cooling (vapor cooled, active cooled) Sun Shield Mass gauge Radio Frequency (RF) Pressure Volume Temperature (PVT) Level Sensor (Cryo-Tracker) Instrumentation Cryo tracker Mass flow rate (fill, vent) Tank pressure Temperature (liquid, vent, tank wall, transfer lines, structure) System acceleration Liquid Acquisition Device (LAD) Settling Propulsion (H2/O2 thruster, solar thermal) H2/O2 thruster Solar thermal Propellant Positional Device (PPD) (magnetic, screen) Cryo-Cooler Mixing (Vehicle maneuvers (roll), pumps) Structural interface (conic, struts) The identification and design of critical CFM components that could be utilized in future exploration architectures in the space environment are being solicited for this platform. The technologies and future development of the platform supporting them would allow demonstration and proof of concepts for the designs and hardware necessary for mechanisms such as fluid transfers in propellant depots and in planetary spacecraft prior to the actual full development, design, fabrication, and launch of hardware. These CFM technologies and platform would provide a simple, low cost and innovative method to prove technologies and could avoid large and costly design modifications or possible multiple launch requirements for future space based architectures. A viable option for the low cost approach involves launching as a secondary payload on launch vehicles currently in use such as an Atlas V or Delta IV. Such launch vehicles hold a high level of design maturity, contributing to a huge savings in development costs. In addition, through riding as a secondary payload, a majority of the launch costs could be absorbed by the primary mission. In a typical launch vehicle configuration, the secondary payload is attached to a launch vehicles second stage propellant tank beneath the primary payload. After separation of the primary payload, the platform would either deploy and operate as a free flying spacecraft and perform the various CFM demonstrations, or could remain attached to the propellant tank to prove fluid transfer capabilities, along with additional experiments. A third option is to utilize the residual propellants from the launch vehicle to fill a receiver tank on the platform, which would subsequently deploy to perform various additional demonstrations. The platform would be processed and integrated in the typical fashion of spacecrafts launched today. A platform that remains completely passive (non-operational and containing no commodities) until separation of the primary payload greatly reduces ground-processing requirements. Individual experiments could also be integrated with the platform prior to integration to the launch vehicle to further reduce operational complexities. The second phase of the project would design a platform so as to encompass additional requirements such as: The capability to support and integrate multiple CFM technology experiments per mission Demonstrating innovative, fluid transfer designs MLI designs Various mass gauging designs Thermal control and boil-off control designs Validation of CFD propellant models Testing of propellant management devices Mixing pumps Thermodynamic vapor cooling systems Environmental thermal shielding designs Design of the platform would need to ensure that it does not impose additional risk to the mission success of the primary payload and is capable of remaining completely passive and inert until the primary payload is successfully deployed. This includes launching with empty tank(s), lines, etc., and maintaining the ability for residual cryogenic propellants to be transferred from the launch vehicle upper stage to the proposed secondary payload upon completion of the primary mission. Optional configurations could include multiple tanks with self-contained fluids, however the use of residuals, with innovative propellant transfer lines, from an upper stage promotes cost savings in both the propellant commodities, pressurization systems required for pre-launch processing, limit hazard and safety concerns for the primary mission, and the passive nature reduces the complexities added in the analyses and operations required for integration with the launch vehicle and primary mission. The platform, itself, would contain tank to tank fluid transfer capabilities, avionics, thermal control systems, telemetry capabilities and, if deployable, an attitude control system. The platform design would be capable of interfacing with the launch vehicle separation system and avionics. Additional potential experiments and uses include validation of CFD propellant models, testing of propellant management devices, mixing pumps, thermodynamic vapor cooling systems, and environmental thermal shielding designs. Performance metrics: A platform that is capable of remaining passive and inert through completion of the primary mission on an EELV. The platform shall be capable of supporting at a minimum of four CFM demonstrations per mission. The designs for the experiments are to be such that they are capable of demonstrating CFM technologies supporting the operational requirements of future space based architectures in cryogenic temperature ranges. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase I Deliverables: Demonstration of technical feasibility (TRL 3-4). Phase II Deliverables: Prototype design and demonstration of innovative technology testing platform, capable of integrating multiple CFM experiments (TRL 4-6). A ready to launch version of this as an EELV secondary payload performing demonstrations of CFM technologies is highly desired. Read less>>"

The goal of this subtopic is to have a highly reliable way of tracking vehicles from launch to orbit utilizing GPS and/or inertial measurement unit. Areas of interest: Metric Tracking Hardware Metric tracking of launch vehicles requires the development of accurate and stable integrated metric tracking and inertial measurement units. The focus is on technologies that enable and advance development of low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP), tactical grade, integrated metric tracking units that provide accurate and stable positioning, attitude, and inertial measurements on highly dynamic platforms. Factors to address include:Ultra-tight coupling of rate sensors, accelerometers, and attitude-determining GPS receivers that will provide very high frequency integrated metric solutions, The ability to reliably function on spin-stabilized rockets (up to 7 rev/s), during sudden jerk and acceleration maneuvers, and in high vibration environments, Advancements in MEMs-based rate sensors and accelerometers, algorithm techniques and Kalman filtering, high bandwidth and low noise outputs, phased-based attitude determination, single aperture systems, quick Time to First Fix and reacquisition. Use of GPS and Ability to Mitigate Interference Signals NASA seeks innovative technologies to increase the accuracy of the L1 C/A navigation solution by combining the pseudo ranges and phases of the L1 C/A signals, and use of the L2 and L5 carriers. Factors to consider:GPS signal degradation can be obtained by differencing the available carrier phase and pseudo range measurements and then removing these differences from the navigation solution. Jamming of GPS signals are a concern during the tracking of launch vehicles. Technologies are sought that combine spatial processing of signals from multiple antennas with temporal processing techniques to mitigate intentional interference signals (jamming) received by the GPS receiver. The coordinated response of adaptive pattern control (beam and null steering) and digital excision of certain interfering signal components can minimize strong jamming signals. Adaptive nulling minimizes interfering signals by the optimal control of the GPS antenna pattern (null steering).Proposals can either address a single subject as described above or a combination of subjects.

General Operational Needs, Requirements and Performance Metrics: Onboard Near-Earth Navigation Systems NASA seeks proposals for development of a commercially viable transceiver with embedded orbit determination software providing enhanced accuracy and integrity for autonomous onboard GPS- based and TDRSS-based navigation, along with time-transfer in near-Earth space via augmentation messages broadcast by TDRSS. The augmentation message should include information on the TDRS orbits, status, and health that could be provided by future TDRS, and should provide information on the GPS constellation based on NASA's TDRSS Augmentation for Satellites Signal (TASS). Proposers are advised that NASA's GEONS and GIPSY orbit determination software packages already support the capability to ingest TASS messages.

Technologies Supporting Improved TDRSS-based Navigation NASA seeks proposals providing improvements in TDRS orbit knowledge, TDRSS radiometric tracking, ground-based orbit determination, and Ground Terminal improvements that improve navigation accuracy for TDRS users. Methods for improving TDRS orbit knowledge should exploit the possible future availability of accelerometer data collected onboard future TDRS. The goal is navigation and communications integrated into a single processor.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.01Mitigation of Aircraft Aging and Durability-Related Hazards, GRC," ARC, LaRC","The mitigation and management of aging and durability-related hazards in future civilian and military aircraft will require advanced materials, concepts, and techniques. NASA is engaged in the research of materials (metals, ceramics, and composites) and characterization/validation test techniques to mitigate aging and durability issues and to enable advanced material suitability and concepts. Proposals are sought for the development of moisture-resistant resins and new surface treatments/primers. Novel chemistries are sought to improve the durability of aerospace adhesives with potential use on subsonic aircraft. This research opportunity is focused on the development of novel chemistries for coupling agents, surface treatments for adherends and their interfaces, leading to aerospace structural adhesives with improved durability. Work may involve chemical modification and testing of adhesives, coupling agents, surface treatments or combinations thereof and modeling to predict behavior and guide the synthetic approaches. Examples of adhesive characteristics to model and/or test may include, but are not limited to, hydrolytic stability of the interfacial chemistry, moisture permeability at the interface, and hydrophobicity of coupling agents and surface primers. Examples of adherends to model and/or test include carbon fiber/epoxy composites used in structural applications on subsonic aircraft, and aluminum, as well as their respective surface treatments. Additionally, proposals are sought for test techniques to fully characterize aging history and strain rate effects on thermoset and/or thermoplastic resins as well as on advanced composites manufactured of such resins and reinforced with 3D fiber preforms such as the triaxial braid used in advanced composite fan containment structures. Technology innovations may take the form of tools, models, algorithms, prototypes, and/or devices. Proposals are sought for the development of validated models to capture the evolution of residual stresses and cold work at machined features of compressor and turbine powder metallurgy superalloy disks. This research opportunity is focused on quantifying, modeling and validating residual stress and cold work evolution at stress concentration features during simulated service in aerospace gas turbine engine disk materials. Work may involve use of notched fatigue specimens to simulate stress concentration features utilizing varied surface finish conditions including as-machined, electro-polished, and shot peened surfaces. The simulated load history and temperature gas turbine engine conditions should approximate turbine service history reflective of the new generation of gas turbine engines and include the effect of superimposed dwell cycles. NASA will be an active participant in Phase I of the research effort by providing the notched specimens, and performing the mechanical testing. Technology innovations may take the form of the unique quantification of the effect of service history on residual stress and cold work depth profile evolutions within notches, and include analytical modeling descriptions of the evolution of these parameters as a function of simulated service history.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.02Sensing and Diagnostic Capability for Aircraft Aging and Damage, LaRC," AFRC, ARC, GRC, MSFC","Many conventional nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques have been used for flaw detection, but have shown little potential for much broader application. One element in NASA's effort to ensure the integrity of future vehicles is research to identify changes in fundamental material properties as indicators of material aging-related hazards before they become critical. For example, composites can exhibit a number of micromechanisms such as fiber buckling and breakage, matrix cracking and delaminations as precursor to failure. For complex metallic components an inability to determine residual stress state limits the validity of predictions of the fatigue life of the component. To further these goals, NDE technologies are being sought for the nondestructive characterization of age-related degradation in complex materials and structures. Innovative and novel approaches to using NDE technologies to measure properties related to manufacturing defects, flaws, and material aging. Measurement techniques, models, and analysis methods related to quantifying material thermal properties, elastic properties, density, microcrack formation, fiber buckling and breakage, etc. in complex composite material systems, adhesively bonded/built-up and/or polymer-matrix composite sandwich structures are of particular interest. Other NDE technologies being sought are those that enable the quantitative assessment of the strength of an adhesive region of bonded joints and repairs or enable the rapid, full-field inspection of large area structures.

To support this predictive capability, structural integrity analytical tools, lifing methods, and material durability prediction tools are being developed. Physics-based and continuum-based models encapsulated as computational methods (software) are needed to provide the basis for these higher level (e.g., design) tools. Proposals are sought that apply innovative computational methods, models and analytic tools to the following specific applications:Probabilistic computational code is sought for improved structural analysis of complex metallic and composite airframe components. The methods used in these solutions need to detail the initiation and progression of damage to determine accurate estimates of residual life and/or strength of complex airframe structures. Software tools are needed to predict the onset and rates of type-II hot corrosion attack in nickel-based turbine disk superalloys that allow for prolonged disk operation at high temperatures. Typically hot corrosion of turbine alloys is a product of molten salt exposure and is manifested by a localized pitting corrosion attack. Prolonged high temperature exposures of turbine disk alloys to sulfur-rich low temperature melting eutectic salts can lead to an onset of Type II hot corrosion attack causing serious degradation to the durability of the turbine components. Computational software is sought to simulate of the response of advanced composite fan case/containment structures in aged conditions to jet engine fan blade-out events using impact mechanics and structural system dynamics modeling techniques.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.07Adaptive Aeroservoelastic Suppression, AFRC," ARC, LaRC","NASA has initiated an Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control (IRAC) effort under the Aviation Safety Program. The main focus of the effort is to advance the state-of-the-art technology in adaptive controls to provide a design option that allows for increased resiliency to failures, damage, and upset conditions. These adaptive flight control systems will automatically adjust the control feedback and command paths to regain stability, maneuverability, and eventually a safe landing. One potential consequence of changing the control feedback and command paths is that an undesired aeroservoelastic (ASE) interaction could occur. The resulting limit cycle oscillation could result in structural damage or potentially total loss of vehicle control. Current airplanes with non-adaptive control laws usually include roll-off or notch filters to avoid ASE interactions. These structural mode suppression filters are designed to provide 8 dB of gain attenuation at the structural mode frequency. Ground Vibration Testing (GVT), Structural Mode Interaction (SMI) testing, and finally full scale flight-testing are performed to verify that no adverse ASE interactions occur. Until a significant configuration or control system change occurs, the structural mode suppression filters provide adequate protection. When an adaptive system changes to respond to off-nominal rigid body behavior, the changes in control can affect the structural mode attenuation levels. In the case of a damaged vehicle, the frequency and damping of the structural modes can change. The combination of changing structural behavior with changing control system gains results in a system with a probability of adverse interactions that is very difficult to predict a priori. An onboard, measurement based method is needed to ensure that the system adjusts to attenuate any adverse ASE interaction before a sustained limit cycle and vehicle damage are encountered. This system must work in concert with the adaptive control system to allow the overall goal of re-gaining rigid body performance as much as possible without exacerbating the situation with ASE interactions.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.08Robust Propulsion Control, GRC," ARC, LaRC","The object of this research topic is to develop approaches for robust propulsion control design to maintain engine operation in the presence of engine icing, foreign object damage such as ice ingestion and bird strikes, or extreme operating conditions such as high angle of attack. Aircraft engines are designed to operate safely over a wide range of conditions. They can ingest small birds with little or no effect, and they are designed with enough stall margin available that the amount of inlet distortion encountered under normal circumstances is not detrimental. However, there is a limit to the variation that the engine can accept. In the case of larger than normal inlet distortion, large bird ingestion, or internal ice build-up, the engine's operation can be far enough from its design point that stability is compromised. In these cases it might still be possible to maintain basic engine function by moving bleed valves or variable stator vanes off of their nominal schedules. This requires the development of a robust control algorithm that delivers normal engine performance over the traditional operating range, but is capable of maintaining operation beyond normal conditions. The expected outcome of the research will be a demonstrated robust propulsion control using a realistic engine model such as the NASA-developed Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS). Any modifications to the simulation required to accurately model the effects of engine ice, FOD, inlet distortion, etc., will be the responsibility of the contractor, and must be based on physical considerations. NASA resources available for the research are the publicly available Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) or a similar simulation.

The presence of a pilot working in a closed-loop fashion with an adaptive flight control presents an important problem that has not been well addressed. Adaptive control generally requires sufficiently rich input signals to improve parameter convergence, as the adaptive control system adapts to parametric changes in the vehicle dynamics or exogenous disturbances. The condition for rich input signals is known as persistent excitation. During adaptation under off-nominal conditions such as aircraft with damage, the pilot provides persistently exciting signals to the adaptive control system. There is generally a trade-off between adaptation and stability due to persistent excitation. With a high persistent excitation in the pilot inputs, the speed of adaptation increases and in theory better handling performance could be achieved. However, in practice, the high persistent excitation in the control signals can potentially cause significant cross coupling between different flight control axes and or excite unmodeled dynamics such as aeroservoelastic modes. The overall effect of high persistent excitation could aggravate stability robustness of an adaptive flight control system with a pilot in the loop that results in poor handling qualities. Another aspect of pilot interactions with an adaptive control system is the potential interactions between two adaptive elements in a closed-loop fashion, because the pilot can also be viewed as an adaptive control system with a learning ability. With the pilot adaptive element providing high persistently exciting inputs into an adaptive flight control system with a predetermined adaptation rate, the issue of stability can be important and difficult to assess. To enable an adaptive flight control system to be operated with a pilot in the loop, it is necessary to develop new research techniques that can assess the effects of pilot interactions with an adaptive flight control system. These techniques should address pilot control responses via an adaptive model with features that can capture relevant interactions with an adaptive flight control system. Techniques for assessing pilot interactions via metrics that can quantify the pilot-vehicle system responses with an adaptive flight control system are also needed. Other aspects of the research can include new methods and tools that can provide an advisory function to limit the pilot control inputs in order to trade off between command-following performance and stability robustness. Research in adaptive control methods will address the system requirements to provide good flying characteristics when the human operator closes the control loop. In the presence of damage, failures, etc. the adaptive system must trade the stability requirements with closed loop handling requirements. Methods for selecting the best achievable handling are needed. The adaptation system needs to find a good compromise between suppression of coupling between the axis (i.e. pitch into roll, etc) and good in-axis behavior. Better metrics to assess cross-coupled (asymmetric) behavior are needed. These metrics could provide a quantitative measurement of the severity of a given failure, as well as a measure of the improvement due to adaptation. As the adaptation changes the flying characteristics of the vehicle, some means of informing the operator is required to ensure that the system is not overdriven by a pilot who is expecting nominal performance.

This effort is to develop the technologies, tools, and techniques to detect in-flight anomalies from adverse events. This involves the integration of novel sensor and advanced analytical technologies for airframe, propulsion systems, and other subsystems within the aircraft. The emphasis of this work is not on diagnosing the exact nature of the failure but on identifying its presence.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.11Diagnosis of Aircraft Anomalies, LaRC," AFRC, GRC, SSC","The capability to identify faults is critical to determining appropriate mitigation actions to maintain aircraft safety. This effort is to develop innovative methods and tools for the diagnosis of aircraft faults and failures. It includes the development of integrated technologies, tools, and techniques to determine the causal factors, nature, and severity of an adverse event and to distinguish that event from within a family of potential adverse events. These requirements go beyond standard fault isolation techniques. The emphasis is on the development of mathematically rigorous diagnostic technologies that are applicable to structures, propulsion systems, software, and other subsystems within the aircraft. Technologies developed must be able to perform diagnosis given heterogeneous and asynchronous signals coming from the health management components of the vehicle and integrating information from each of these components. The ability to actively query health management systems, use advanced decision making techniques to perform the diagnosis, and then assess the severity using these techniques are critical. As an example, the mathematical rigor of the diagnosis and severity assessment could be treated through a Bayesian methodology since it allows for characterization and propagation of uncertainties through models of aircraft failure and degradation. Both computational and prototype hardware implementations of the diagnostic capabilities are expected\ outcomes of this effort. Other methods could also be employed that appropriately model the uncertainties in the subsystem due to noise, various stresses due to the aerodynamic forces inherent in flight, and other sources of uncertainty. The ability to actively query the underlying health management systems (whether they are related to detection or not) is critical to reducing the uncertainty in the diagnosis. As an example, if there is ambiguity in the diagnosis about the type and location of a particular failure in the aircraft structure, the diagnostic engine should be able to actively query that system or related systems to determine the true location and severity of the anomaly. An important element is the use of structural health monitoring tools based on the application of damage progression models with statistical inference and multivariate decision schemes to aid in the integration of multiple sensors for structural vibration and/or strain measurements in a noisy environment. Where possible, a rigorous mathematical framework should be employed to provide a rank ordered list of diagnoses, an assessment of the severity of each diagnosed event, and a measure of the uncertainty in the diagnosis. Understanding and addressing the system integration and validation issues are critical components of this effort. Read less>>"

The vastness of this data means that data mining methods must be efficient and scalable so that they can return results quickly. Additionally, much of this data will be distributed among multiple systems. Data mining methods that can operate on the distributed data where they are is critical because centralizing data will typically be impractical. However, these methods must be provably able to return the same results as what a comparable method would return if the data could be centralized because this is a critical part of verifying and validating these algorithms, which is important for aviation safety applications. This topic will yield efficient and scalable data-driven algorithms for anomaly detection, diagnosis, prediction, and prognosis that are able to operate at levels ranging from the aircraft level to the fleet level. To that end, the methods must be able to efficiently learn from vast historical time-series datasets (at least 10 TB) that are heterogeneous (contain continuous, discrete, and/or text data).

By employing distributed flight control surfaces, a modern wing structure (which implies aircraft wing, horizontal stabilizer, and vertical stabilizer) can be strategically tailored in-flight by actively controlling the wing shape so as to bring about certain desired vehicle characteristics. For example, active aeroelastic wing shape tailoring can be employed to control the wash-out distribution and wing deflection in such a manner that could result in improved aerodynamic performance such as reduced drag during cruise or increased lift during take-off. Another novel use of active aeroelastic wing shape tailoring is for flight control. By actively controlling flexible aerodynamic surfaces differentially or collectively, the motion of an aircraft can be controlled in all three stability axes. In high speed supersonic or hypersonic vehicles, effects of airframe-propulsion-structure interactions can be significant. Thus, propulsion control can play an integral role with active aeroelastic wing shape tailoring control in high speed flight regimes. This technology area involves the development of various technical elements including:Innovative aircraft concepts that can significantly improve aerodynamic performance and control by leveraging active aeroelastic wing shape tailoring. Sensor technology that will enable in-flight wing twist and deflection static and dynamic measurements for control development. Actuation methods that examine novel modes of actuation for actively controlling wing shape in-flight, and effective placements of distributed control effectors on a wing structure. Vehicle dynamic modeling capability for aero-propulsive-servo-elasticity that will provide a knowledge foundation upon which vehicle control and dynamics can be developed. Integrated approaches for active aeroelastic wing shape tailoring control with distributed control surfaces that will provide effective advanced control strategies to achieve aerodynamic performance and flight control objectives, taken into account airframe-propulsion-structure interactions that can exist in all three flight regimes. Gust Load Alleviation Control In a future NextGen operational concept, close separation between aircraft in super density operations could lead to more frequent wake vortex encounters. The increasing use of flexible airframe design in modern aircraft will inherently lead to a potential increase in vehicle dynamic response to turbulence and wake vortices. Gust load alleviation control technology can improve ride qualities and reduce undesired structural dynamic loading on flexible airframes that could shorten aircraft service life. Gust load alleviation control technology can be either reactive or predictive. In a traditional reactive control framework, flight control systems can be designed to provide sufficient aerodynamic damping characteristics that suppress vehicle dynamic response as rapidly as possible upon a turbulence encounter. There is a trade off, however, between increased damping for mode suppression and command-following objectives of a flight control system. Large damping ratios, while desirable for mode suppression, may result in poor flight control performance. Predictive control can provide a novel gust load alleviation strategy for future aircraft design with lightweight flexible structures. Novel look-ahead sensor technology can measure or estimate turbulent intensity to provide such information to a predictive gust load alleviation control system which in turn would dynamically reconfigure flight control surfaces as an aircraft enters a turbulent atmospheric region. Technology development of predictive gust load alleviation control may include the following:Novel sensor technology for Optical Air Data Systems based on LIDAR or other novel detection methods that can measure near-field air turbulent velocity components directly in front of an aircraft in the order of one-body length scale to provide nearly instantaneous predictive capability to significantly improve the effectiveness of a gust load alleviation control system. Predictive gust load alleviation control technology that can reliably reconfigure flight control surfaces dynamically based on the sensor information of the near-field turbulence to mitigate the vehicle structural dynamic response upon a turbulence encounter. The predictive control strategies should be cognizant of potential adverse effects due to potential latency issues that can counteract the objective of gust load alleviation, or potential structural mode interactions due to control input signals that may contain frequencies close to the natural frequencies of the airframe. Modular and Distributed Control for Propulsion Systems Modular and flexible control architecture for propulsion systems is an essential technology, which will enable the full realization of turbine engine system performance. Distributed technology can alleviate the thermal constraints on engine control electronics by improving tolerance to elevated temperature and creating opportunities for relocating electronics to a more compatible environment. It will enable the implementation of more complex control law, paving the way for further integration of performance-enhancing control for reduced fuel burn, lower emissions, and operability. Directly, distributed control will reduce engine system weight. This is a multi-disciplinary research area involving high temperature electronics, sensing and actuation, control system integration, and engine system stability. Read less>>"
Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics ,"A2.08Aircraft Systems Analysis, Design and Optimization", LaRC," ARC, GRC","One of the approaches to achieve the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Program goals is to solve the aeronautics challenges for a broad range of air vehicles with system-level optimization, assessment and technology integration. The needs to meet this approach can be defined by four general themes:Design Environment Development; Variable Fidelity, Physics-Based Design/Analysis Tools; Technology Assessment and Integration; and Evaluation of Advanced Concepts.Current interdisciplinary design/analysis involves a multitude of tools not necessarily developed to work together, hindering their application to complete system design/analysis studies. Multi-fidelity, multi-disciplinary optimization frameworks, such as Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS), have been developed by NASA but have limited capabilities to simulate complete vehicle systems. Solicited topics are aligned with these four themes that will support this NASA research area. Design Environment Development Technology development is needed to provide complex simulation and modeling capabilities where the computer science details are transparent to the engineer. A framework environment is needed to provide a seamless integration environment where the engineer need not be concerned with where or how particular codes within the system level simulation will be run. Interfaces and utilities to define, setup, verify, determine the appropriate resources, and launch the system simulation are also needed. Research challenges include the engineering details needed to numerically zoom (i.e., numerical analysis at various levels of detail) between multi-fidelity components of the same discipline, as well as, multi-discipline components of the same fidelity. A major computer science challenge is developing boundary objects that will be reused in a wide variety of simulations. Proposals will be considered that enable coupling differing disciplines, numerical zooming within a single discipline, deploying large simulations, and assembling and controlling secure or non-secure simulations. Variable Fidelity, Physics-Based Design/Analysis Tools An integrated design process combines high-fidelity computational analyses from several disciplines with advanced numerical design procedures to simultaneously perform detailed Outer Mold Line (OML) shape optimization, structural sizing, active load alleviation control, multi-speed performance (e.g., low takeoff and landing speeds, but efficient transonic cruise), and/or other detailed-design tasks. Current practice still widely uses sequential, single-discipline optimization, at best coupling low-fidelity modeling of other relevant disciplines during the detailed design phase. Substantial performance improvements will be realized by developing closely integrated design procedures coupled with highest-fidelity analyses for use during detailed-design. Design procedures must enable rapid determination of sensitivities (gradients) of a design objective with respect to all design variables and constraints, choose search directions through design space without violating constraints, and make appropriate changes to the vehicle shape (ideally both external OML shape and internal structural element size). Solicitations are for integrated design optimization tools that find combinations of design variables from more than one discipline and can vary synergistically to produce superior performance compared to the results of sequential, single-discipline optimization or repeated cut-and-try analysis. Technology Assessment and Integration Improved analysis capability of integrated airframe and propulsion systems would allow more efficient designs to be created that would maximize efficiency and performance while minimizing both noise and emissions. Improved integrated system modeling should allow designers to consider trade-offs between various design and operating parameters to determine the optimum design for various classes of subsonic fixed wing aircraft ranging from personal aircraft to large transports. The modeling would also be beneficial if it had enough fidelity to enable it to analyze both conventional and unconventional systems. Current analysis tools capable of analyzing integrated systems are based on simplified physical and semi-empirical models that are not fully capable of analyzing aircraft and propulsion system parameters that would be required for new or unconventional systems. Analysis tools are solicited that are capable of analyzing new and unconventional aircraft and propulsion integrated systems. These include: (1) New combustor designs, alternate fuel operation, and the ability to estimate all emissions, and (2) Noise source models (e.g., fan, jet, turbine, core and airframe components). Analyses tools that are scalable, especially to small aircraft, are desired. Evaluation of Advanced Concepts Conceptual design and analysis of unconventional vehicle concepts and technologies is needed for technology portfolio investment planning, development of advanced concepts to provide technology pull, and independent technical assessment of new concepts. This capability will enable ""virtual expeditions through the design space"" for multi-mission trade studies and optimization. This will require an integrated variable fidelity concept design system. The aerospace flight vehicle conceptual design phase is, in contrast to the succeeding preliminary and detail design phases, the most important step in the product development sequence, because of its predefining function. However, the conceptual design phase is the least well understood part of the entire flight vehicle design process, owing to its high level of abstraction and associated risk, its multidisciplinary design complexity, its permanent shortage of available design information, and its chronic time pressure to find solutions. Currently, the important primary aerospace vehicle design decisions at the conceptual design level (e.g., overall configuration selection) are still made using extremely simple analyses and heuristics. An integrated, variable fidelity system would have large benefits. Higher fidelity tools enabling unconventional configurations to be addressed in the conceptual design process are solicited.

The first part is the Turbomachinery and Heat Transfer and the second part is Propulsion Integration. Turbomachinery and Heat Transfer There is a critical need for advanced turbomachinery and heat transfer concepts, methods and tools to enable NASA to reach its goals in the various Fundamental Aeronautics projects. These goals include drastic reductions in aircraft fuel burn, noise, and emissions, as well as an ability to achieve mission requirements for Subsonic Rotary Wing, Subsonic Fixed Wing, Supersonics, and Hypersonics Project flight regimes. In the compression system, advanced concepts and technologies are required to enable high stage loading and wider operating range while maintaining or improving aerodynamic efficiency. Such improvements will enable reduced weight and part count, and will enable advanced variable cycle engines for various missions.

To achieve these breakthrough achievements related to drag reduction, the system level requirements for viable aircraft configurations utilizing laminar flow technologies must be established. Although numerous flight tests have proven the aerodynamic possibilities, such flight tests are much too expensive to allow for extensive parametric exploration and optimization to reduce the risks. Therefore, one of the key contributions needed to further advance the technology readiness level of laminar flow technologies integrated into vehicle concepts is the ability to conduct ground-based testing at relevant chord and unit Reynolds numbers. To achieve this need, the ERA Project plans to use the National Transonic Facility (NTF). The NTF is a pressurized, cyrogenic wind tunnel capable of approximately 45 million chord Reynolds numbers at transonic speeds. To date, testing has been done on a Natural Laminar Wing Model with mixed results. The preliminary results indicate contaminants in the flow path of the wind tunnel contributed to early boundary layer transition on the model. These contaminants are suspected to be a combination of minute frost particles, oil droplets, and dust. Based on the surface quality requirements for laminar flow testing at the conditions of the NTF contaminants as small as a few microns are sufficient to disrupt the stability of the boundary layer.This solicitation seeks proposals to develop: Wind tunnel circuit cleaning techniques/processes to remove oil and dust contaminates from the NTF and other similar facilities. Because of the cryogenic testing requirements for dry test circuits water-based approaches are discouraged. The proposed process needs to demonstrate that particles and oil at the micron level can be sufficiently captured and removed from the test environment.

A significant reduction in Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) will be required to meet the goal of a 50% reduction in fuel burn. One path that engine manufactures are proposing to meet the required SFC improvements is a return to the open rotor technology first tested in the 1980s. Many challenges to using open rotors on future generations of aircraft exist, both from the design and operations standpoint. One of the design challenges of the open rotor is determining the in-flight installed thrust of the open rotor on the aircraft.Current practice with turbofans involves an extensive series of ground tests that determine corrections for the installed engine thrust relative to its measured uninstalled configuration. Currently, there is no acceptable method that has been proven to duplicate this for open rotors. Additionally, there is currently no way to directly measure thrust during flight on an installed engine for this class of aircraft.This solicitation seeks proposals to develop and validate:Develop methods and techniques to correct ground tested thrust measurements for installed, in-flight effects of an open rotor propulsion system.

Also sought are technologies (analysis, algorithms, and testbeds) to enable detailed analysis, synthesis, modeling, and visualization of such distributed systems. Formation flight can synthesize large effective telescope apertures through, multiple, collaborative, smaller telescopes in a precision formation. Large effective apertures can also be achieved by tiling curved segments to form an aperture larger than can be achieved in a single launch, for deep-space high resolution imaging of faint astrophysical sources. These formations require the capability for autonomous precision alignment and synchronized maneuvers, reconfigurations, and collision avoidance.

Science,Topic S2 Advanced Telescope Systems ,S2.02Proximity Glare Suppression for Astronomical Coronagraphy, JPL," ARC, GSFC","This subtopic addresses the unique problem of imaging and spectroscopic characterization of faint astrophysical objects that are located within the obscuring glare of much brighter stellar sources and innovative advanced wavefront sensing and control for cost-effective space telescopes. Examples include planetary systems beyond our own, the detailed inner structure of galaxies with very bright nuclei, binary star formation, and stellar evolution. Contrast ratios of one million to ten billion over an angular spatial scale of 0.05-1.5 arcsec are typical of these objects. Achieving a very low background requires control of both scattered and diffracted light. The failure to control either amplitude or phase fluctuations in the optical train severely reduces the effectiveness of starlight cancellation schemes. This innovative research focuses on advances in coronagraphic instruments, starlight cancellation instruments, and potential occulting technologies that operate at visible and infrared wavelengths. The ultimate application of these instruments is to operate in space as part of a future observatory mission. Much of the scientific instrumentation used in future NASA observatories for the astrophysical sciences will require control of unwanted radiation (thermal and scattered) across a modest field of view. The performance and observing efficiency of astrophysics instruments, however, must be greatly enhanced. The instrument components are expected to offer much higher optical throughput, larger fields of view, and better detector performance. The wavelengths of primary interest extend from the visible to the thermal infrared. Measurement techniques include imaging, photometry, spectroscopy, and polarimetry. There is interest in component development, and innovative instrument design, as well as in the fabrication of subsystem devices to include, but not limited to, the following areas: Starlight Suppression Technologies Advanced starlight canceling coronagraphic instrument concepts; Advanced aperture apodization and aperture shaping techniques; Advanced apodization mask or occulting spot fabrication technology controlling smooth density gradients to 10-4 with spatial resolutions ~1 µm, low dispersion, and low dependence of phase on optical density; Metrology for detailed evaluation of compact, deep density apodizing masks, Lyot stops, and other types of graded and binary mask elements.

The desired areal density is 1 - 10 kg/m2. Static and dynamic wavefront error tolerances to thermal and dynamic perturbations may be achieved through passive means (e.g., via a high stiffness system, passive thermal control, jitter isolation or damping) or through active opto-mechanical control. Large deployable multi-layer structures in support of sunshades for passive thermal control and 20m to 50m class planet finding external occulters are also relevant technologies.

Potential systems include 12 to 30 meter class segmented primary mirrors for UV/optical or infrared wavelengths and 8 to 16 meter class segmented x-ray telescope mirrors. These potential future space telescopes have very specific mirror technology needs. UV/optical telescopes (such as ATLAST-9 or ATLAST-16) require 1 to 3 meter class mirrors with In view of the very large total mirror or lens collecting aperture required, affordability or areal cost (cost per square meter of collecting aperture) rather than areal density is probably the single most important system characteristic of an advanced optical system. For example, both x-ray and normal incidence space mirrors currently cost $3 million to $4 million per square meter of optical surface area. This research effort seeks a cost reduction for precision optical components by 20 to 100 times, to less than $100K/m2. The primary purpose of this subtopic is to develop and demonstrate technologies to manufacture ultra-low-cost precision optical systems for very large x-ray, UV/optical or infrared telescopes. Potential solutions include but are not limited to new mirror materials such as Silicon carbide or nanolaminates or carbon-fiber reinforced polymer; or new fabrication processes such as direct precision machining, rapid optical fabrication, slumping or replication technologies to manufacture 1 to 2 meter (or larger) precision quality mirror or lens segments (either normal incidence for UV/optical/infrared or grazing incidence for x-ray). Another key enabling technology is optical coatings. UV/optical telescopes require broadband (from 100 nm to 2500 nm) high-reflectivity mirror coating with extremely uniform amplitude and polarization properties which can be deposited on 1 to 3 meter class mirror. EUSO requires anti-reflection coatings which can be deposited onto 2.5 meter diameter PMMA Fresnel lenses. In both cases, ability to demonstrate optical performance on 2.5 meter class optical surfaces is important. Successful proposals will demonstrate prototype manufacturing of a precision mirror or lens system or precision replicating mandrel in the 0.25 to 0.5 meter class with a specific scale up roadmap to 1 to 2+ meter class space qualifiable flight optics systems. Material behavior, process control, optical performance, and mounting/deploying issues should be resolved and demonstrated. The potential for scale-up will need to be addressed from a processing and infrastructure point of view. An ideal Phase I deliverable would be a near UV, visible or x-ray precision mirror, lens or replicating mandrel of at least 0.25 meters. The Phase II project would further advance the technology to produce a space-qualifiable precision mirror, lens or mandrel greater than 0.5 meters, with a TRL in the 4 to 5 range.

Science,Topic S3 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems ,S3.02Thermal Control Systems, GSFC," ARC, GRC, JPL, MSFC","Future Spacecraft and instruments for NASA's Science Mission Directorate will require increasingly sophisticated thermal control technology. Innovative proposals for the cross-cutting thermal control discipline are sought in the following areas:Optical systems, lasers (ICESAT 2), and detectors require tight temperature control, often to better than +/- 1°C. Some new missions such as LISA require thermal gradients held to even tighter micro-degree levels. Methods of precise temperature measurement and control to tight temperature levels are needed. New generations of electronics used on numerous missions have higher power densities than in the past. High conductivity, vacuum-compatible interface materials to minimize losses across make/break interfaces are needed to reduce interface temperature gradients and facilitate heat removal. Detectors and optical systems at infrared wavelengths require efficient cooling methods to low temperatures. Advanced thermoelectric devices with higher Coefficients of Performance (COP) are required. More sensitive instruments are resulting in increased requirements for high electrical conductivity on spacecraft instruments and surfaces. This has increased the need for advanced thermal control coatings, particular with low absorptance, high emmittance, and good electrical conductivity. Phase change systems are needed for Mars or Lunar applications. Reusable phase change systems are desired which can be employed to absorb transient heat dissipations during instrument operations. Technology is sought for phase change systems, typically near room temperature, which can then either store this energy or provide an exothermic process, which would provide heat for instrument power-on after the dormant phase. Future high-powered missions, some possibly nuclear powered, may require active cooling systems to efficiently transport large amounts of heat. These include single and two-phase mechanically pumped fluid loop systems which accommodate multiple heat sources and sinks; and long life, lightweight pumps which are capable of generating a high pressure head. It also includes efficient, lightweight, oil-less, high lift vapor compression systems or novel new technologies for high performance cooling up to 2 KW. Exploration science missions beyond earth orbit present engineering challenges requiring systems, which can withstand extreme temperatures ranging from high temperatures on Venus to the cryogenic temperatures of the outer planets. High performance insulation systems, which are more easily fabricated than traditional multi-layer (MLI) systems, are required for both hot and cold environments.

Proposals more aligned with exploration mission requirements should be proposed in X8. S3.04 Propulsion Systems The Science Mission Directorate (SMD) needs spacecraft with more demanding propulsive performance and flexibility for more ambitious missions requiring high duty cycles, more challenging environmental conditions, and extended operation. Planetary spacecraft need the ability to rendezvous with, orbit, and conduct in situ exploration of planets, moons, and other small bodies in the solar system (http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10432(link is external)). Future spacecraft and constellations of spacecraft will have high-precision propulsion requirements, usually in volume- and power-limited envelopes.

Advancements in chemical and electric propulsion systems related to sample return missions to Mars, small bodies (like asteroids, comets, and Near-Earth Objects), outer planet moons, and Venus are desired. Additional electric propulsion technology innovations are also sought to enable low cost systems for Discovery class missions, and eventually to enable radioisotope electric propulsion (REP) type missions. The focus of this solicitation is for next generation propulsion systems and components, including high-pressure chemical rocket technologies and low cost/low mass electric propulsion technologies.

The proposals should provide a feasible plan to fully develop a technology and infuse it into a NASA program. Note to Proposer: Topic X2 under the Exploration Mission Directorate also addresses advanced propulsion. Proposals more aligned with exploration mission requirements should be proposed in X2. S3.05 Power Management and Storage Future NASA science objectives will include missions such as Earth Orbiting, Venus, Europa, Titan, Lunar Quest and Space Weather. Under this subtopic, proposals are solicited to develop energy storage and power electronics to enable or enhance the capabilities of future science missions. The unique requirements for the power systems for these missions can vary greatly, with advancements in components needed above the current State of the Art (SOA) for long life, high reliability, low mass/volume, radiation tolerance, and wide temperature operation. Energy Storage Future science missions will require advanced primary and secondary battery systems capable of operating at temperature extremes from -100°C for Titan missions to 400°C to 500°C for Venus missions, and a span of -230°C to +120°C for Lunar Quest. In addition, high energy-density rechargeable electrochemical battery systems that offer greater than 50,000 charge/discharge cycles (10 year operating life) for low-earth-orbiting spacecraft, 20 year life for geosynchronous (GEO) spacecraft, are desired. Advancements to battery energy storage capabilities that address one or more of the above requirements for the stated missions combined with very high specific energy (>200 Wh/kg for secondary battery systems) and energy density, along with radiation tolerance are of interest. In addition to batteries, other advanced energy storage/load leveling technologies designed to the above mission requirements, such as flywheels, supercapacitors or magnetic energy storage, are of interest.

In conjunction with the RPS, intelligent, fault-tolerant PMAD technologies are needed to efficiently manage the system power for these deep space missions. Advances in electrical power technologies are required for the electrical components and systems for these future platforms to address program size, mass, efficiency, capacity, durability, and reliability requirements. Of importance are expected improvements in energy density, speed, efficiency, or wide-temperature operation (-125°C to over 450°C) with a number of thermal cycles. Advancements are sought for power electronic devices, components and packaging for Venus type missions with power ranges of a few watts for minimum missions up to a few kilowatts for large missions. For the lower power applications (up to 20 watts), NASA desires to build smaller spacecraft types carrying smaller instrument packages. However, power requirements to accommodate these instruments and spacecraft systems will not necessarily shrink in a similar fashion as spacecraft size.

Particular importance is attached to the acquisition of test data that can help validate thermodynamic and fluid mechanic models that will ultimately be used to design the Titan flight balloon. The size of balloon required for Titan will be approximately 10 m in diameter and will require 2 kW of thermal energy to float the balloon at an expected Titan temperature of 85 to 95 K.

Science,Topic S3 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems ,S3.05Power Management and Storage, GRC," ARC, JPL, JSC","Future NASA science objectives will include missions such as Earth Orbiting, Venus, Europa, Titan, Lunar Quest and Space Weather. Under this subtopic, proposals are solicited to develop energy storage and power electronics to enable or enhance the capabilities of future science missions. The unique requirements for the power systems for these missions can vary greatly, with advancements in components needed above the current State of the Art (SOA) for long life, high reliability, low mass/volume, radiation tolerance, and wide temperature operation. Energy Storage Future science missions will require advanced primary and secondary battery systems capable of operating at temperature extremes from -100°C for Titan missions to 400°C to 500°C for Venus missions, and a span of -230°C to +120°C for Lunar Quest. In addition, high energy-density rechargeable electrochemical battery systems that offer greater than 50,000 charge/discharge cycles (10 year operating life) for low-earth-orbiting spacecraft, 20 year life for geosynchronous (GEO) spacecraft, are desired. Advancements to battery energy storage capabilities that address one or more of the above requirements for the stated missions combined with very high specific energy (>200 Wh/kg for secondary battery systems) and energy density, along with radiation tolerance are of interest. In addition to batteries, other advanced energy storage/load leveling technologies designed to the above mission requirements, such as flywheels, supercapacitors or magnetic energy storage, are of interest. These technologies have the potential to minimize the size and mass of future power systems. Power Management and Distribution (PMAD) The ""New Frontiers in the Solar System: An Integrated Exploration Strategy"" (http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10432(link is external)), the 2006 Solar System Exploration Roadmap (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/about-us/science-strategy) and the Science Plan for NASA's Science Mission Directorate (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/about-us/science-strategy) all describe the need for radioisotope power systems (RPS) for planetary exploration. In conjunction with the RPS, intelligent, fault-tolerant PMAD technologies are needed to efficiently manage the system power for these deep space missions. Advances in electrical power technologies are required for the electrical components and systems for these future platforms to address program size, mass, efficiency, capacity, durability, and reliability requirements. Of importance are expected improvements in energy density, speed, efficiency, or wide-temperature operation (-125°C to over 450°C) with a number of thermal cycles.

Science,Topic S3 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems ,S3.07Terrestrial and Planetary Balloons, GSFC, JPL,"All proposals should show an understanding of one or more relevant science needs, and present a feasible plan to fully develop a technology and infuse it into a NASA program. Terrestrial Scientific Balloons NASA's Scientific Balloons provide practical and cost effective platforms for conducting discovery science, development and testing for future space instruments, as well as training opportunities for future scientists and engineers. Balloons can reach altitudes above 36 kilometers, with suspended masses up to 3600 kilograms, and can stay afloat for several weeks. Currently, the Balloon Program is on the verge of introducing an advanced balloon system that will enable 100 day missions at mid latitudes and thus resemble the performance of a small spacecraft at a fraction of the cost. In support of this development, NASA is seeking innovative technologies in three key areas to monitor and advance the performance of this new vehicle. (1) Power Storage: Devices or methods to store electrical energy onboard the balloon with lower mass than current techniques are needed. Long duration balloon flights at mid-latitudes will experience up to 12 hours of darkness, during which electrical power is needed for experiments and NASA support systems. Typically, solar panels are flown to generate power during the daylight hours, and excess power is readily available. This excess power needs to be stored for use during the night. Current power storage techniques consist of rechargeable batteries which range from lead-acid to lithium-ion chemistries. Innovative alternatives to these batteries, either advanced chemistries or alternate power storage techniques such as capacitors or flywheels, which result in overall mass savings are needed. Nominal voltage levels for balloon systems are 28 volts DC, and nominal power levels can vary from 100 watts to 1000 watts. Therefore, power storage requirements range from 1000 watt-hours to 12,000-watt hours or more. Alternative power systems, which do not rely on solar panels, may also be proposed. These alternative systems may use energy storage techniques such as fuel cells or flywheels, which are prepared or charged on the ground prior to flight, and then would provide continuous power throughout the flight at the power levels specified above. Spacecraft power storage requirements are found under subtopic S3.05 Power Management and Storage. (2) Balloon Instrumentation: Devices or methods are desired to accurately measure ambient air temperature, helium gas temperature, balloon film temperatures, film strain, and tendon load are desired. These measurements are needed to accurately model the balloon performance during a typical flight at altitudes of approximately 36 kilometers. The measurements must compensate for the effects of direct solar radiation through shielding or calculation. Minimal mass and volume are highly desired. Remote sensing of the parameters and non-invasive and non-contact approaches are also desired. The non-invasive and non-contact approaches are highly desired for the thin polyethylene film measurements used as the balloon envelope, with film thickness ranging from 0.8 to 1.5 mil. Strain measurements of these thin films via in-flight photogrammetric techniques would be beneficial. Devices or methods to accurately measure axially loaded tendons on an array of ~50 or up to 300 separate tendons during flight are of interest. Tendons are typically captured at the end fittings via individual pins with loading levels ranging from ~20 N to ~8,000 N per tendon, and can be exposed to temperatures from room temperature to the troposphere temperatures of -90 degrees Celsius or colder. The measurement devices must be compatible with existing NASA balloon packaging, inflation, and launch methods. These instruments must also be able to interface with existing NASA balloon flight support systems or alternatively, a definition of a data acquisition solution be provided. Support telemetry systems are not part of the this initiative; however, data from any sensors (devices) that are selected from this initiative must be able to be stored on board and/or telemetered in-flight using single-channel (two-wire) interface into existing NASA balloon flight support systems. The devices of interest shall be easily integrated and shall have minimal impact on the overall mass of the balloon system. (3) Low-Cost Variable Conductance Heat Pipes for Balloon Payloads: With the ever-increasing complexity of both scientific instruments and NASA mission support equipment, advanced thermal control techniques are needed. The type of advanced thermal control techniques desired are similar to those utilized on large-budget orbital and deep space payloads (variable conductance heat pipes, diode heat pipes, loop heat pipes, capillary pumped loops, heat switches, louvers) are far more expensive to implement on balloon payloads that their limited budgets can afford. Innovative solutions are sought that would allow these more advanced thermal control measures to be utilized with reduced expense. Spacecraft thermal control requirements are found under subtopic S3.02 Thermal Control Systems. Though not considered ""cutting-edge technology"", commercial quality, constant conductance, copper-methanol heat pipes have begun to be utilized on balloon payloads to effectively move heat significant distances. The problem with these devices is that the conductance cannot effectively be reduced under cold operating or cold survival environment conditions without expending significant energy in an active heater to maintain the condenser section warm. It is desirable to develop a cost-effective method of conducting the heat in this manner and allowing the flow to be reduced/eliminated when conditions warrant. Therefore, innovative thermal control techniques and devices developed must be inexpensive to implement. They must function reliably at balloon altitudes of 30-40km and temperature ranges from -90C to +40C. They should require little or no energy consumption and provide the capability of moderating heat flow autonomously or by remote control under certain thermal conditions. Planetary Balloons Innovations in materials, structures, and systems concepts have enabled buoyant vehicles to play an expanding role in planning NASA's future Solar System Exploration Program. Balloons and airships are expected to carry scientific payloads at Titan and Venus that will perform in situ investigations of their atmospheres and near surface environments.

Advancements in materials, structures, and systems related to sample return missions to the Moon, planetary bodies (e.g., Mars and Venus), small bodies (e.g., asteroids, comets, and Near-Earth Objects) and outer planet bodies are desired. EEVs provide several challenges to current material and structural designs in several areas. New classes of structure and impact materials are needed which are lightweight and versatile, remaining stiff during impact with soft surfaces while providing low impact loads when crushing with impact to hard surfaces. Lightweight structures that are suitable for thermal protection system (TPS) substructures, including serving as a thermal barrier or sink, are also desired.

Appropriate sensing technologies for this topic should provide measurements of physical forces or properties that support some aspect of EDL operations.

Science,Topic S5 Robotic Exploration Technologies ,"S5.02Sample Collection, Processing, and Handling", JPL," ARC, GSFC, JSC","Robust systems for sample acquisition, handling and processing are critical to the next generation of robotic explorers for investigation of planetary bodies (http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10432&page=R1(link is external)). Limited spacecraft resources (power, volume, mass, computational capabilities, and telemetry bandwidth) demand innovative, integrated sampling systems that can survive and operate in challenging environments (extremes in temperature, pressure, gravity, vibration and thermal cycling). Special interest lies in sampling systems and components (actuators, gearboxes, etc.) that are suitable for use in the extremely hot high-pressure environment at the Venusian surface (460ºC, 93 bar). Relevant systems could be integrated on multiple platforms, however of primary interest are samplers that could be mounted on a mobile platform, such as a rover. For reference, current Mars-relevant rovers range in mass from 200 - 800 kg. Sample Acquisition Research should be conducted to develop compact, low-power, lightweight subsurface sampling systems that can obtain 1 cm diameter cores of consolidated material (e.g., rock, icy regolith) up to 10 cm below the surface. Systems should be capable of autonomously acquiring and ejecting samples reliably. Also of interest are methods of autonomously exposing rock interiors from below weathered rind layers. Other sample types of interest are unconsolidated regolith, dust, and atmospheric gas.Sample Manipulation (core management, sub-sampling/sorting, powder transport) Sample manipulation technologies are needed to enable handling and transfer of structured and unstructured samples from a sampling device to instruments and sample processing systems. Core, cuttings, and regolith samples may be variable in size and composition, so a sample manipulation system needs to be flexible enough to handle the sample variability. Core samples will be on the order of 1 cm diameter and up to 10 cm long. Soil and rock fragment samples will be of similar volumes.Sample Integrity (encapsulation and contamination) For a sample return mission, it is critical to find solutions for maintaining physical integrity of the sample during the surface mission (rover driving loads, diurnal temperature fluctuations) as well as the return to Earth (cruise, atmospheric entry and impact). Technologies are needed for characterizing state of sample in situ - physical integrity (e.g., cracked, crushed), sample volume, mass or temperature, as well as retention of volatiles in solid (core, regolith) samples, and retention of atmospheric gas samples. Also of particular need are means of acquiring subsurface rock and regolith samples with minimum contamination. This contamination may include contaminants in the sampling tool itself, material from one location contaminating samples collected at another location (sample cross-contamination), or Earth-source microorganisms brought to the Martian surface prior to drilling ('clean' sampling from a 'dirty' surface). Consideration should be given to use of materials and processes compatible with 110 - 125°C dry heat sterilization. In situ sterilization may be explored, as well as innovative mechanical or system solutions - e.g., single-use sample ""sleeves,"" or fully-integrated sample acquisition and encapsulation systems. For a sample return mission, sample transfer of a payload into a planetary ascent vehicle: Automated payload transfer mechanisms; and Orbiting Sample (OS) sealing techniques.

Science,Topic S5 Robotic Exploration Technologies ,S5.03Surface and Subsurface Robotic Exploration, JPL," ARC, GSFC, JSC, LaRC","Technologies are needed to enable access, mobility, and sample acquisition at surface and subsurface sampling sites of scientific interest on Mars, Venus, small planetary bodies, and the moons of the Earth, Mars, Jovian and Saturnian systems. Many scientifically valuable sites are accessible only via terrain that is too difficult for state-of-the-art planetary rovers to traverse in terms of ground slope, rock obstacle size, plateaus, and non-cohesive soils types. Sites include crater walls, canyons, gullies, sand dunes, and high rock density regions. Tethered systems, non-wheeled systems, and marsupial systems are examples of mobility technologies that are of interest. These technologies could enable new approaches for deployment, retrieval, access, and mobility. A variety of mobility system architectures can be considered. Single vehicle systems might utilize a 200 kg class rover and dual vehicle systems might utilize a 500 - 800 kg primary vehicle that provides long traverse to the vicinity of a challenging site and then deployment of a smaller 20 - 50 kg vehicle with steep mobility capability for access and sampling at the site. For surface and subsurface sampling, advanced manipulation technologies are needed to deploy instruments and tools from landers and rovers. Technologies to enable acquisition of subsurface samples are also needed. For Mars and Venus, technologies are needed to acquire core samples in the shallow subsurface to about 10cm and to enable subsurface sampling in multiple holes at least 1 - 3 meters deep through rock, regolith, or ice compositions. Shallow subsurface sampling systems need to be low mass and deeper subsurface sampling solutions need to be integratable onto 500 - 800 kg stationary landers and mobile platforms. For Europa, penetrators and tools to allow deep drilling are needed to sample and bore the outer water-ice layer and through 10 to 30km to a potential liquid ocean below Consideration should be given for potential failure scenarios, such as platform slip and borehole misalignment for integrated systems, and the challenges of dry drilling into mixed media including icy mixtures of rock and regolith. Systems should ensure minimal contamination of samples from Earth-source contaminants and cross-contamination from samples at different locations or depths. Innovative component technologies for low mass, low power, and modular systems tolerant to the in-situ environment are of particular interest. For Europa, the radiation environment is estimated at 2.9 Mrad total ionizing dose (TID) behind 100 mil thick aluminum. Technical feasibility should be demonstrated during Phase I and a full capability unit of at least TRL level 4 should be delivered in Phase II.

The principal means of detection and tracking of the Orbiting Sample Canister (OSC) is optically with visual-band cameras. The challenging technology of long-range optical sensors for detection and distant tracking is not part of this call, however, short-range optical (or other) sensors and an on-sample radio-metric-based back-up detection and tracking method is desired, including a low-power, low-mass illuminator for short-range imaging of up to 0.5km. Sample capture mechanisms are sought, of very low mass and volume, and of low complexity and extremely high reliability, including detection of contact with the capture mechanism. Appropriate on-sample radio-beacons are sought that are compatible with NASA's radio systems, in particular, the Electra onboard programmable radio system; requirements for these beacons are for long life, and independent initiation of on-orbit operation. Solutions are sought that are either battery powered or via solar cells that do not reduce the overall OSC outer shell visual albdeo below 0.5. Sample capture mechanisms should include close-proximity/contact sensors, including immediate-field imaging. Methods are sought to provide a practice mechanism for testing rendezvous and proximity operations with a test sample canister in Earth or Mars orbit. The test carrier and release mechanism must be of very low mass and volume, and the test sample canister(s) should carry a radio beacon. Test OSC canisters should be of limited life after release, ceasing broadcast, and degrading in surface reflectance in approximately one month after release to avoid confusion with the actual canister.

Survivability in extreme high temperatures and high pressures is also required for deep atmospheric probes to giant planets. Proposals are sought for technologies that enable the in situ exploration of the surface and deep atmosphere of Venus and the deep atmospheres of Jupiter or Saturn for future NASA missions. Venus features a dense, CO2 atmosphere completely covered by sulfuric acid clouds at about 55 km above the surface, a surface temperature of about 486 degrees Centigrade and a surface pressure of about 90 bars. Technologies of interest include high temperature and acid resistant high strength-to-weight textile materials for landing systems (balloons, parachutes, tethers, bridles, airbags), high temperature electronics components, high temperature energy storage systems, light mass refrigeration systems, high-temperature motors and actuators for robotic arms and other mechanisms, high temperature drills, phase change materials for short term thermal maintenance, low conductivity and high-compressive strength insulation materials, high temperature optical window systems (that are transparent in IR, visible and UV wavelengths) and advanced materials with high specific heat capacity and strength for pressure vessel construction, and pressure vessel components compatible with materials such as steal, titanium and beryllium such as low leak rate wide temperature (-50 degrees Centigrade C to 500 degrees Centigrade) seals capable of operating between 0 and 90 bars. Low Temperature Environments Low temperature survivability is required for surface missions to Titan (-180 degrees Centigrade), Europa surface (-220 degrees Centigrade), Ganymede (-200 degrees Centigrade) and comets. Also the Earth's Moon equatorial regions experience wide temperature swings from -180 degrees Centigrade to +130 degrees Centigrade during the lunar day/night cycle, and the sustained temperature at the shadowed regions of lunar poles can be as low as -230 degrees Centigrade. Mars diurnal temperature changes from about -120 degrees Centigrade to +20 degrees Centigrade.

Science,Topic S5 Robotic Exploration Technologies ,S5.06Planetary Protection, JPL, LaRC,"NASA seeks innovative technologies to facilitate meeting Back Planetary Protection objectives for a potential Mars Sample Return mission and to facilitate Forward Planetary Protection implementation for a potential mission to Europa. Back Planetary Protection deals with the possibility that Mars material may pose a biological threat to the Earth's biosphere. This leads to a constraint that returned samples of Mars material be contained with extraordinary robustness until they can be tested and proved harmless or be sterilized by an accepted method. Achieving this containment goal will require new technology for several functions. Containment assurance requires ""breaking the chain of contact"" with Mars: the exterior of the sample container must not be contaminated with Mars material. Also, the integrity of the containment must be verified, the sample container and its seals must survive the worst-case Earth impact corresponding to the candidate mission profile, and the Earth entry vehicle (EEV) must withstand the thermal and structural rigors of Earth atmosphere entry - all with an unprecedented degree of confidence. Back Planetary Protection technologies for the following MSR functions are included in this call: Container Design, Sealing, and Verification: Options for sealing the sample container include brazing, explosive welding, and various types of soft seals, with sealing performed either on the Mars surface or in orbit. Confirmation of sealing can be provided by observation of sealing system parameters and by leak detection after sealing. Wireless data and power transmission may be needed for leak detection. Additional containment using a flexible liner within the EEV that is sealed while in Mars orbit has also been considered. Further validation prior to Earth entry may also be needed. Breaking-the-Chain and Dust Mitigation: Several paths have been identified that would result in Mars material contaminating the outside of the sealed sample container and/or the Earth return vehicle (ERV). Technology options for mitigation include ejection of containment layers during ascent and orbit and/or capturing a contaminated ""Orbiting Sample"" into a clean container on the ERV and then ejecting the capture device. Meteoroid Protection and Breach Detection: Protection is required for both the sample container and the EEV heat shield, with the later appearing to be the more challenging technology requirement. New lightweight shielding techniques are needed. Even with these the shield may be excessively heavy leading to a requirement for technology to detect a breach of the shield or damage to the EEV. Entry, Descent, and Landing: The EEV should be aerodynamically self-righting and should provide shock attenuation for the sample container consistent with the planned no-parachute descent. PRA and Reliability Analysis: Obtaining approval to proceed with an MSR mission is likely to involve quantitative assessment of the probability of containment loss. This will benefit from advances in the state of the art of probabilistic risk assessment for complex space systems and of reliability analysis of the spacecraft components involved. Technologies are desired for the Europa mission that allow sterilization of previously non-sterilizable flight hardware by either i) dry heat processing or ii) gamma irradiation. NASA also seeks to use iii) hydrogen peroxide vapor processes for re-sterilization of assembled flight hardware elements. Proposals are invited for innovative approaches to sterilization of flight hardware in the pre-flight environment using this technology. Note: this call is not for novel sterilization processes. For Europa, products and technologies are sought that can be demonstrated to be compatible with the three identified sterilization processes, as well as the environmental conditions of spaceflight and the Jovian system. Candidate technologies for the following functions and capabilities are included in this call: Sterilization Process Compatibility: Options for proving compatibility of novel product elements (materials, parts) with recognized spacecraft sterilization process parameters are desired. Redesign for Sterilization: Development of alternative solutions for spacecraft hardware is needed where there are known sterilization process incompatibilities, for example for heat tolerant sensors, seals (battery, valve), optical coating applications. Biobarrier Technology: Demonstration of novel biobarrier and recontamination prevention approaches for spacecraft hardware is needed when applying one or more of these three sterilization processes.

As a result, solutions that involve the following must clearly explain how they would work in the NASA environment: Grid computing, web services, client-server models, embarrassingly parallel computations, and technologies that require significant application re-engineering. Projects need not benefit all NASA HEC users or application codes, but demonstrating applicability to an important NASA discipline, or even a key NASA application code, could provide significant value. Specific technology areas of interest include: Efficient Computing: In spite of the rapidly increasing capability and efficiency of supercomputers, NASAs HEC facilities cannot purchase, power, and cool sufficient HEC resources to satisfy all user demands.

Examples include novel computational accelerators and architectures, more capable storage/interconnect/visualization technologies, improved algorithms for key codes, and power-aware Green computing technologies and techniques. Integrated Environments: The user interface to a supercomputer is typically a command line in a text window. This subtopic element seeks more intuitive, intelligent, user-customizable, and integrated interfaces to supercomputing resources, enabling users to more completely leverage the power of HEC to increase their productivity. Such an interface could enhance many essential supercomputing tasks: accessing and managing resources, training, getting services, developing codes, running computations, managing files and data, analyzing and visualizing results, transmitting data, collaborating, etc. Cloud Supercomputing: Cloud computing has made tremendous promises, and demonstrated some success, for business computing: on-demand resource availability, resource virtualization, automated job migration, increased system availability, customized software environments, a web user interface, increased system reliability, and more.

Science,Topic S6 Information Technologies ,S6.05Software Engineering Tools for Scientific Models, GSFC," JPL, LaRC","This subtopic seeks to improve the productivity and quality of NASA's scientific modeling endeavors through customized tools, which enable and encourage improved software engineering practices. Because many of NASA's principal scientific models have evolved over decades to be hundreds of thousands of lines long with contributions from a wide variety of scientists, much of the software has become ""brittle"" in the sense that it has become difficult to extend, couple, and optimize. In other software communities (and other programming languages), access to modern software tools has enabled large gains in productivity by providing high-level tools for isolating software defects (bugs) as well as by automating common, albeit tedious, software processes. The goal is to extend these capabilities to support the Fortran programming language so that NASA's scientific models can extract similar benefits.Target Programs, Missions and Mission Classes Advances in developer productivity would be of significant benefit to several research and analysis programs within the Science Mission Directorate including: High-End Computing Program (http://hec.nasa.gov) Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction Program (http://map.nasa.gov) Technology Areas The objective is to create a suite of software tools, which directly ameliorate the most significant bottlenecks to productivity in the development of scientific models: Tools that assist in the construction of fine-grained unit-level software tests based upon existing functionality in a legacy Fortran application. Although tests written by developers are desirable, such tests are exceedingly difficult to create for legacy numerical software. Suites of these tests could provide a significant element of risk-reduction for maintenance and extension of these models, and would be incorporated into some sort of unit-testing framework.

For short round trip missions to MARS, NTP systems may be enabling by helping to reduce launch mass to reasonable values and by also increasing the payload delivered for Mars exploration missions. Preliminary solid core NTP system concepts could be based on a high thrust/high ISP (~850-950s) NTP system that would use a fission reactor with U-235 fuel as its source of thermal energy. During the short primary propulsion maneuvers of a typical conceptual mission, large quantities of thermal power (100's of MWt) would be produced within the NTP system and removed using liquid hydrogen propellant that is pumped through the engine's reactor core.

Monitoring technologies are employed to assure that the chemical and microbial content of the air and water environment of the astronaut crew habitat falls within acceptable limits, and that the life support system is functioning properly and efficiently.

Exploration Systems,Topic X4 Extra-Vehicular Activity Technology ,"X4.03Space Suit Radio, Displays, Cameras, and Integrated Systems", JSC, GRC,"Tunable RF Front End and Transceiver A major impetus behind the MEMS technology stems from compactness, which leads to lower power dissipation, higher levels of integration, lower weight, volume, and cost. To shrink form factor and enable efficient surface operations, one of the cornerstone components of this radio is the tunable filter.Recent advances in RF MEMs filters and resonator technology have permitted very high quality factors (>1000) at GHz frequencies. Achieving high and excellent tuning range (>2:1) to bandwidth ratio without cryogenic cooling is now viable for the S-band frequency. For reliability, the tunable filter should employ a contact-less tuning scheme. Power-Aware Processing To support Quality of Service (QoS) of different applications, it's inadequate to optimize power at design time, but dynamic power management must be employed to ensure power efficiency. To maximize power efficiency, the radio must be able to adjust power and update rates to suit for diverse missions. Users should have the ability to specify QoS for different data streams. The radio must have the capability to scale power, select optimum modes of operation, and minimum energy profiles. During low-rate-processing intensive modes, including local processing and compression of telemetry data and voice, highly energy-efficient low-voltage, low-performance modes must be used. For high-rate-processing intensive modes, like advance signal encoding of high definition imagery, medium performance modes must be used; and during active communication modes (which may have a low duty-cycle), ultra-high-performance modes must be used. Accordingly, the digital platform must be highly agile and use-case aware to continuously minimize energy. Below are some desirable features to consider: Variation-Tolerant, Performance-Scalable Architectures Hardware must sense its own limitation at a dynamically varying, performance-driven optimal energy operating point, and reconfigure accordingly. If variability is stressed at the low-voltage operating point, redundant hardware should be used to improve reliability; if throughput is stressed at the high-performance operating point, redundant hardware should be used to increase parallelism. Energy-Aware Algorithms for Adaptive Hardware Algorithms must be aware of the different hardware operating-points and associated architecture. For instance, during low-power modes targeting voice and data (for telemetry), occasional high through-put applications (like high-rate imagery) should dynamically switch to algorithms employing extreme parallelism in order to support a minimum operating voltage. Modularity and Extensibility Enabling platform must support open architecture and accommodate rapid upgrades, multiple protocols, new technology advances, complete re-configurability of functionality, and evolution of planetary communications and network infrastructure. Phase I Deliverables: Given maximum range of 4km, telemetry, voice at 8 kbps, high definition imagery at 20 Mbps, and S-band frequency operating at 2.4 - 2.483 GHz, assess radio ultimate mass, size, and power. This should be backed with analyses and simulation to ensure achievable performance and power targets. One significant prerequisite to Phase II is the development of a promising and novel MEMS-based radio architecture that comprises: a highly programmable frontend and highly programmable digital basebands with the MAC implementation of multiple protocols and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption. The offeror must demonstrate the ability to achieve significant advantages in compactness, power efficiency, and reliability.Phase II Deliverables: Develop a reliable, intelligent, and power-efficient MEMS-based EVA radio prototype unit that demonstrates robust RF performance, frequency agility, re-configurability, and dynamic power management for voice, telemetry, and high definition imagery under power budget constraints. Demonstrate a highly programmable frontend and digital basebands with the MAC implementation for multiple open standard protocols. Consider a three-node network configuration for interoperability. Integrate AES encryption as well as power-aware technologies and ensure QoS applications fall within prescribed power constraints. Displays To surmount geometric constraints, compact external flat panel or helmet-mounted display technologies are needed to improve situational awareness, mobility, suit monitoring, and task management. Hands-free interactive control of visual information (text, graphics, images, and video) using conversational spoken dialogue can improve work efficiency over audio communications as well as increase productivity and safety. High resolution suit displays must be able to operate outside the protection of the suit in bright surroundings, thermal, radiation, and vacuum environments as well as internally without imposing ignition hazards due to 100 percent oxygen environment. Sensors Crew health and suit monitoring require advancement of lightweight CO2, biomedical (heart rate, blood OX, EKG) and core temperature sensors with reduced size, increased reliability, and greater packaging flexibility. Consequently, technologies are needed to provide high accuracy, low mass, and low-power sensors that measure flow rate, pressure, temperature, and relative humidity or dew point. All sensors must operate in a low pressure 100% O2 environment with high humidity and may be exposed to liquid condensate. Because missions must be designed with appropriate radiation shielding and adjusted to keep the radiation doses within tolerable limits, real-time, accurate, instantaneous and integrated radiation dose measurements and readout are needed such as novel dosimeter sensors. Given sufficient warning, astronauts can move to a more shielded part of the space vehicle and lessen dose impact. As cosmic rays impinge upon the vehicle leaving the magnetosphere, sensors are needed to determine the type of radiation and dose as well as reduce the potential risk of biological tissue damage.High Definition (HD) Cameras Ultra-compact, low- power, HD cameras are needed to support both high definition motion and high resolution still imagery, providing low loss compressed digital data output for transmission over RF and/or IP networks. Key features include advanced wireless networking for transmitting video at high bandwidth, high-quality image compression algorithms, radiation tolerant image sensor and processing platform capable of running video compression in near real time. The cameras must provide excellent situational awareness for crew members and quality imagery for remote viewing, scientific research, exploration, and public relations. They will be mounted on space and planetary vehicles (e.g. rovers), so remote operation (pan, tilt, focus, zoom, light level controls) can be controlled by astronaut in a suit, and the image projected onto a helmet display or remotely for Earth-based operations.Integrated Systems A complete system of displays, cameras, sensors must be integrated under a common interface. A key enabler will be advanced spoken dialogs. Typing or using a touch menu is too cumbersome with space suit gloves. Voice commands are much more natural for the suited astronaut and can increase situational awareness. In case of voice failure, a backup system can be implemented to perform all critical functions. Not only can this capability reduce crew workload, but it can immensely enhance operational efficiency. Such functions can alert crew about progressive deterioration of equipment preceding failures. Sensor data can be read out to determine the heart rate, body temperature, and CO2 levels. Cameras can be turned on, aimed at precise locations, and either still or motion imagery can be taken. Rather than separate control interfaces, a total solution is needed for integrating a suite of space suit functions: displays, cameras, sensors, audio, and voice. Hands-free interaction requires automated planning, scheduling, consumable management, suit monitoring, and display presentation. Advanced spoken dialogue system which works in an acoustic environment of the space suit and provides an interface to control all space suit, display, camera, sensor, and audio functions will allow a natural operation of complex suite of space suit capabilities.

One simple example of a secondary structure could be a walkway internal to a lunar surface habitat, which could be reconfigured as a storage container or a radiation shield during a major solar flare event. These secondary multi-functional structures should provide highly robust, stiff and mass efficient surfaces that enable the useful outfitting and pre-integration of subsystems within the primary structural volume. In general, development of structural concepts can include structural components, methods of validation, and/or predictive analysis capabilities.

Systems should include ability to perform inspections with minimal human interaction. These systems need to provide reliable assessments of the location and extent of damage with the minimal data transfer between vehicle and Earth. Methods are desired to perform inspections in areas with difficult access in pressurized habitable compartments and external environments. Many applications require the ability to see through conductive and/or thermal insulating materials without contacting the surface. Sensors that can dynamically and accurately determine position and orientation of the NDE sensor are needed to automatically register NDE results to precise locations on the structure. Structural design and material configurations are sought that can enhance NDE and monitoring. Advanced processing and displays are needed to reduce the complexity of operations for astronaut crews who may only use the NDE tool infrequently, but need to make important assessments quickly.

Spacecraft vehicle electronics will be required to operate across a wide temperature range and must be capable of enduring frequent (and often rapid) thermal-cycling. Packaging for these electronics must be able to accommodate the mechanical stress and fatigue associated with the thermal cycling.

Exploration Systems,Topic X8 High-Efficiency Space Power Systems ,X8.01Fuel Cells and Electrolyzers for Space Applications, GRC," JPL, JSC","Fuel Cells and Electrolyzers for Space Applications Advanced primary fuel cell and regenerative fuel cell energy storage systems are enabling for various aspects of future Exploration missions. Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) and Solid Oxide Based systems are of particular interest.Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cells and Electrolyzers Proposals that address technology advances related to the following issues for PEM fuel cell, electrolysis, and regenerative fuel cell systems are desired. Oxidation resistant gas diffusion layers (GDLs) for PEM fuel cell membrane-electrode-assemblies (MEAs)GDLs are integral to PEM fuel cell MEAs. Traditional carbon or graphite based GDLs are very susceptible to oxidation under certain operating conditions in the pure oxygen environment of space fuel cell systems. This results in MEA degradation and shortened life. Proposals addressing the development of oxidation resistant GDLs that remain stable to oxidation in a pure oxygen environment, and provide improved performance and longer life are desired.Passive liquid-feed high-pressure PEM electrolysis technology - Water electrolysis technology is critical for water utilization and hydrogen/oxygen generation. Standard liquid-feed PEM electrolysis technology requires numerous mechanical ancillary components for reactant management functions, including pumps and two-phase water/gas separators. These components present life and reliability issues in addition to their inherent mass and volume penalties, and also require parasitic power for operation. Vapor-feed PEM electrolysis technology avoids the necessity of these ancillary components, but suffers from reduced electrochemical performance and operational constraints. Development of passive liquid-feed PEM electrolysis technology could offer the benefits of both aforementioned systems without the drawbacks. This would yield an electrolysis system with strong electrochemical performance and a minimum of ancillary components with their inherent system penalties.Oxidation resistant, electrically conductive, hydrophilic coatings for internal cell components within PEM fuel cells and electrolyzers Liquid water is produced within the reactant cavities of PEM fuel cells and consumed within the reactant cavities of PEM electrolyzers. In the case of a non-flow-through PEM fuel cell, the liquid product water moves across an open but supported gas cavity and through a water/gas separation barrier into a liquid cavity. If the supporting cell components within the gas cavity are hydrophobic, the water will be transported as droplets, which could impede gas flow and subsequently reduce electrochemical performance. If these supporting components are hydrophilic, the water is more likely to be transported as a film along the support structure and not impede gas flow. In the case of a PEM electrolyzer, water is moving in the opposite direction and therefore into the reactant cavity. A hydrophilic support structure would allow a flowing film of liquid water to reach the cell MEA while still maintaining an open reactant cavity relative to gas flow. In essence, an electrolysis cell assembly designed for vapor-feed operation could operate in a liquid-feed mode. This would yield a system with strong electrochemical performance and a minimum of ancillary components with their inherent system penalties.Stable, highly efficient, long-life MEAs and catalysts for PEM fuel cells and electrolyzers - PEM fuel cells and electrolyzers are key technologies for space systems utilizing hydrogen, oxygen, or water as reactants. In order to improve the life and reliability of the electrochemical stacks within these systems, as well as to reduce overall system mass/volume and cost, development of MEAs and catalysts that are stable and highly efficient is critical. Techniques to accomplish this goal include, but are not limited to, alternative noble metal and mixed oxide catalysts with increased surface areas, advanced binders and catalyst layer application techniques, alternative ionomer formulations, and high-temperature membrane compatibility.

The process of bone demineralization begins almost immediately upon an astronaut's arrival into a microgravity environment and appears to continue unabated. The losses occur particularly in weight bearing bone regions of the lower spine, hip and legs. NASA will eventually require diagnostics techniques that can perform in vivo quantitative evaluations of bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular micro-architecture (i.e., porosity, trabecular size and geometry) during manned Exploration class missions. As an incremental step toward this end, a high-resolution diagnostic or imaging device is required for performing the quantitative evaluations identified above ex vivo with a technology that shows significant promise for adaptability to long duration human space flight. The device should be capable of resolving the trabecular micro-structure for analysis. The device should also demonstrate sufficient penetration depth in the body to eventually adapt the technology for in vivo evaluations of the calcaneus and lumbar spine, at a minimum. Efforts should be made to minimize the volume, mass, electromagnetic emissions and power draw of the device and its associated peripheral equipment.

This investment has produced a large number of technologies that include hardware (e.g., instruments, devices, etc.) and software (e.g., computational models, informatics tools, data analytic methods, etc.) While these technologies are put to good use by their developers, such non-commercial developers devote little attention to making their tools robust and easy to use by the broad research or clinical communities. Consequently, the promise of these advanced technologies is often realized only by the tool's developers and their close associates. Moreover, ongoing support to maintain and update technologies in non-commercial settings is difficult to obtain. In contrast, tools that are commercially available need to be sturdy and easy to use, and commercial success often provides the means for continued maintenance and improvements of the underlying technology. This call is intended to formulate business plans that will move useful technologies from non-commercial laboratories into the commercial marketplace by inviting SBIR grant applications for further development of such technologies that are relevant to the missions of the NASA's Human Research Program. The supported research and development will likely include making the tools more robust and easy to use, advancing the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) from TRL 3-4 to TRL 6-7 and will likely require close collaboration between the original developers of these technologies and commercial partners.

There are only a few battery chemistries with a reasonable chance of achieving the target specific energies. Metal/air battery systems are the most likely candidates. The most common type of commercial metal/air battery utilizes zinc/air chemistry and has a practical specific energy of ~370 Wh/kg. While this battery chemistry has a theoretical specific energy of 1350 Wh/kg, it is not possible for this chemistry to meet the specific energy goals for these applications (>2000 Wh/kg).

Aluminum/air batteries have a much greater theoretical specific energy (8140 Wh/kg) and although they currently have a practical specific energy of ~350 Wh/kg, the potential for significant near-term improvement exists. The highest theoretical specific energy for a metal/air battery chemistry is lithium/air at 11,500 Wh/kg giving it and aluminum/air batteries the best potential to realize the high specific energy values needed for Exploration Medical Capabilities mission applications.

For example, it would require approximately 10,000 kg of packaged food with a 5-year shelf life for a 6-crew, 1000 day mission to Mars. It has been proposed to use a food system which incorporates processing of raw ingredients into edible ingredients and uses these edible ingredients in recipes in the galley to produce meals.

This food system would also require food processing and food preparation equipment. The equipment should be miniaturized, multipurpose and efficiently use vehicle resources such as mass, volume, water, and power.There are some unique parameters that need to be considered when developing the technologies. The Moon's gravity is 1/6 of Earth's gravity, and that of Mars is 3/8 of Earth's. In addition, it is proposed that the habitat will have an atmospheric pressure of 8 psia, equivalent to being on a 16,000 foot mountain top. These two factors will affect heat and mass transfer during food processing and food preparation.

Accurate biochemical results depend on maintaining the integrity of blood and urine samples until analyses can be completed. Improper sample collection, handling, or preservation may lead to critical errors in diagnostic interpretation of analytical results. Traditional methods have been developed that include the use of sample component separation by means of centrifugation, refrigeration, freezing or the addition of preservatives to maintain the integrity of biological samples. While such techniques are easily achieved in a routine clinical setting, the spaceflight environment presents unique challenges to sample processing and stowage. Thus, novel on-orbit methods for the ambient preservation of biological samples are critical for scientific research, monitoring of crew health and evaluation of countermeasure efficacy. The development of alternative innovative techniques with advantages over currently used methods for processing and preserving biological samples at ambient temperatures during spaceflight that provide a high level of reliability in maintaining a wide array of both blood and urine analytes over a long period of ambient stowage is highly desirable.

Focus Area 1 In-Space Propulsion Technologies,S3.02Propulsion Systems for Robotic Science Missions, GRC," JPL, MSFC", TA2 In-Space Propulsion Technologies, 2017,"The Science Mission Directorate (SMD) needs spacecraft with more demanding propulsive performance and flexibility for more ambitious missions requiring high duty cycles, more challenging environmental conditions, and extended operation. Planetary spacecraft need the ability to rendezvous with, orbit, and conduct in-situ exploration of planets, moons, and other small bodies in the solar system (http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/download-detail.cfm?DL_ID=742). Future spacecraft and constellations of spacecraft will have high-precision propulsion requirements, usually in volume- and power-limited envelopes. Also recently precise propulsion systems have been incorporated into disturbance reduction systems to demonstrate that a solid body can float freely in space completely undisturbed in order to explore the gravitational universe. However, technology limits to propulsion system life still exist which can ultimately limit mission duration for more ambitious follow-on formation flying applications. This subtopic seeks innovations to meet SMD propulsion in chemical and electric propulsion systems related to sample return missions to Mars, small bodies (like asteroids, comets, and Near-Earth Objects), outer planet moons, and Venus. Additional electric propulsion technology innovations are also sought to enable low cost systems for Discovery class missions, and low-power, nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) missions. Roadmaps for propulsion technologies can be found from the National Research Council (http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13354&page=168(link is external)) and NASA’s Office of the Chief Technologist (http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/501329main_TA02-InSpaceProp-DRAFT-Nov2010-A.pdf). Proposals should show an understanding of the state of the art, how their technology is superior, and of one or more relevant science needs. The proposals should provide a feasible plan to fully develop a technology and infuse it into a NASA program. In addressing technology requirements, proposers should identify potential mission applications and quantify the expected advancement over state-of-the-art alternatives. Advanced Electric Propulsion Components Towards that end, this solicitation seeks to mature and demonstrate iodine electric propulsion technologies. Iodine propellant has two key advantages over the state-of-the-art (SOA) xenon propellant: (i) increased storage density and (ii) reduced storage pressure. These key advantages permit iodine propulsion systems with conformal storage tanks, reduced structural mass, and reduced volume compared with the SOA xenon, while retaining similar thrust, specific impulse, and thruster efficiency. This subtopic seeks proposals that mature iodine propulsion technologies, including: Iodine compatible Hall Effect Thruster cathodes with lifetimes greater than 10,000 hours. Robust and electrically efficient iodine storage and delivery system architectures (scalable 5 kg to 100 kg iodine): Numerical modeling to guide system design and CONOPS, predicting power consumption, iodine mobility, thermal transport, sublimation rate, condensation, clogging, recovery time post-anomalies, etc. Design and analysis of innovative iodine feed system architectures. Experimental demonstration of promising feed system architectures under conditions of long-term iodine storage and dynamic thermal environments. Compact low-power iodine compatible feed system technologies, including high accuracy pressure sensors (<1 atm full scale), propellant flow control valves, latch valves, heaters, etc. Feed system technologies utilizing innovative iodine resistant materials and coating. Experimental and numerical demonstration of component operation in dynamic simulated mission environments. This subtopic also seeks proposals that explore uses of technologies that will provide superior performance in for high specific impulse/low mass electric propulsion systems at low cost. These technologies include: Thruster components including, but not limited to, advanced cathodes, rf devices, advanced grids, lower-cost components enabled by novel manufacturing techniques. Any long-life, electric propulsion technology between 1 to 10 kW/thruster that would enable a low-power nuclear electric propulsion system based on a kilopower nuclear reactor. Secondary Payload Propulsion The secondary payload market shows significant promise to enable low cost science missions. Launch vehicle providers, like SLS, are considering a large number of secondary payload opportunities. The majority of these satellite missions flown are often selected for concept or component demonstration activities as the primary objectives. Opportunities are anticipated to select future satellite missions based on application goals (i.e., science return). However, several technology limitations prevent high value science from low-cost spacecraft, such as post deployment propulsion capabilities, Additionally, propulsion systems often place constraints on handling, storage, operations, etc. that may limit secondary payload consideration. It is desired to have a wide range of Delta-V capability to provide 100-1000s of m/s. Specifically, proposals are sought for: Chemical and/or electric propulsion systems with green/non-toxic propellants. Improved operational life over SOA propulsion systems. In addressing technology requirements, proposers should identify potential mission applications and quantify the expected advancement over state-of-the-art alternatives. Solar/Electric Sail Propulsion This subtopic seeks sail propulsion innovations in three areas for future robotic science and exploration missions: Large solar sail propulsion systems with at least 1000 square meters of deployed surface area for small (<150 kg) spacecraft to enable multiple Heliophysics missions of interest. Electric sail propulsion systems capable of achieving at least 1 mm/sec2 characteristic acceleration to support Heliophysics missions of interest and rapid outer solar system exploration. Electrodynamic tether/sail propulsion systems capable generating from the Lorentz Force delta-V sufficient to de-orbit from altitudes up to 2,000 km and to maintain a small (< 500 kg) spacecraft in LEO at altitudes up to 400 km for 5 years enabling Earth ionospheric and plasmasphere investigations.

Focus Area 1 In-Space Propulsion Technologies,Z10.01Cryogenic Fluid Management, GRC," JSC, MSFC", TA14 Thermal Management Systems, 2017,"This subtopic solicits technologies related to cryogenic propellant (such as hydrogen, oxygen, and methane) storage, and transfer to support NASA's exploration goals. This includes a wide range of applications, scales, and environments consistent with future NASA missions. Such missions include but are not limited to a Methane Upper Stage and In-Situ Resource Utilization in cooperation with Mars Landers in support of the Evolvable Mars Campaign. Specifically, listed in order of importance: Analysis of cryogenic systems for improved modeling of turbulence effects on heat and mass transfer across the liquid/gas interface. Of particular interest are improved models for turbulent heat transfer and mass transfer across the liquid/gas interface that can be applied to Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations using Eulerian-based two-phase models, such as Volume of Fluid. Data to guide modeling efforts such as NASA-TM-2003-212926 or NASA-TM-105411. Mars surface cryogenic storage requires a vacuum jacket in order to reduce heat leak and power requirements. A lightweight vacuum jacketed system may be possible, where the vacuum jacket is designed for Mars atmospheric pressure (5-7 torr). The vacuum jacket may be launched purged, evacuated upon reaching orbit, and then sealed prior to Mars entry. The vacuum jacketed system would then have to retain a vacuum for several years while on the surface of Mars. New and improved technologies that provide for the densification (or sub-cooling) of cryogenic propellants. Propellant conditioning systems that allow for the production and maintenance of densified propellants that support operations including transfer and low-loss storage are of prime interest for future space vehicle and ground launch processing facilities. Analysis of cryogenic systems sometimes requires computational fluid dynamics, especially when significant deformation or breakup of the liquid/gas interface occurs. For many components, or for settled conditions, a simpler fluid and thermal network approach may be sufficient. Of interest is the capability to tightly couple CFD and fluid/thermal network approaches, such as a fluid-thermal network analysis of an active pressure control system coupled to a CFD simulation of the fluid and thermodynamics occurring in a cryogenic storage tank.

Focus Area 1 In-Space Propulsion Technologies,Z10.03Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP), MSFC," GRC, SSC", TA2 In-Space Propulsion Technologies, 2017,"Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) Solid core NTP has been identified as an advanced propulsion concept which could provide the fastest trip times with fewer SLS launches than other propulsion concepts for human missions to Mars over a variety of mission years. The current NASA Strategic Space Technology Investment Plan states NTP is a high priority technology needed for future human exploration of Mars. NTP had major technical work done between 1955-1973 as part of the Rover and Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA) programs. A few other NTP programs followed including the Space Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (SNTP) program in the early 1990's. The NTP concept is similar to a liquid chemical propulsion system, except instead of combustion in the thrust chamber, a monopropellant is heated with a fission reactor (heat exchanger) in the thrust chamber and exposes the engine components and surrounding structures to a radiation environment. Engine System Design Focus is on a range of modern technologies associated with NTP using solid core nuclear fission reactors and technologies needed to ground test the engine system and components. The engines are pump fed ~15,000-35,000 lbf with a specific impulse goal of 900 seconds (using hydrogen), and are used individually or in clusters for the spacecraft's primary propulsion system. The NTP can have multiple start-ups (>4) with cumulative run time >100 minutes in a single mission, which can last a few years. The Rover/NERVA program ground tested a variety of engine sizes, for a variety of burn durations and start-ups with the engine exhaust released to the open air. Current regulations require exhaust filtering of any radioactive noble gases and particulates. The NTP primary test requirements can have multiple start-ups (>8) with the longest single burn time ~50 minutes. Technologies being sought include: Reactor fuel element designs with high temperature (> 2600K), high power density (>5 MW/L) to optimize hydrogen propellant heating. New additive manufacturing processes to quickly manufacture the fuel with uniform channel coatings and/or claddings that reduce fission product gas release and reactor particulates into the engines exhaust stream. Fuel can made of Ceramic-metallic (cermet) or composite/carbide designs: New fuel element geometries which are easy to manufacture and coat, and better performing than the traditional prismatic fuel geometries with small through holes with coatings. Insulator design (one application is for tie tubes) which has very low thermal conductivity and neutron absorption, withstands high temperatures, compatible with hot hydrogen and radiation environment, and light weight. Operations and Safety Engine operation involves start-up, full thrust operation, shutdown, coast, and restart. Technologies being sought include advanced instrumentation and special reactor safety design features which prevent uncontrolled reactor criticality accidents. Also needed are radiation shielding technologies that minimize exposure to other stage components and reduce total crew radiation dose. Specific areas of interest include: Concepts to cool down the reactor decay heat after shutdown to minimize the amount of open cycle propellant used in each engine shutdown. (Depending on the engine run time for a single burn, cool down time can take many hours.) Low risk reactor design features which allow more criticality control flexibility during burns beyond the reactor circumferential rotating control drums, and/or provide nuclear safety for ground processing, launch, and possible launch aborts: Control of criticality with water submersion and compaction accidents. Concept for quick restart of reactor (2-6 hours) after 30-40 minute burns and accounting for Xe135 buildup. Radiation shielding concepts that protect the crew and minimize heating of store propellant and the stage. Strategies that minimize radiation shielding system mass, such as utilization of the payload and consumables for shielding (when practical) that may provide an additional bonus of shielding galactic cosmic radiation as well as radiation from the NTP engines. Ground Test Technologies Environmental regulations require NTP engine exhaust filtering of radioactive noble gases and particulates to maintain safe environmental levels. NTP engine ground testing will require the development of large scale engine exhaust scrubber technologies and options for integrating it to the NTP engine for ground tests (reference 51st AIAA/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference paper AIAA 2015-3773, 'Review of Nuclear Thermal Propulsion Ground Test Options', D. Coote, et al). Included in this area of technology development needs are identification and application of robust materials, advanced instruments and monitoring systems capable of operating in extreme temperature, pressure and radiation environments. Specific areas of interest include: Advanced high-temperature and hydrogen embrittlement resistant materials for use in a hot hydrogen environment (<5500°F) and possibly exposed to neutrons and gamma rays. Efficient generation of high temperature, high flow rate hydrogen (<30 lb/sec). Devices for measurement of radiation, pressure, temperature and strain in a high temperature and radiation environment: Non-intrusive diagnostic technology to monitor engine exhaust for fuel element erosion/failure and release of radioactive particulates. Effluent scrubber technologies for efficient filtering and management of high temperature, high flow hydrogen exhausts. Specific interests include: Filtering of radioactive particles and debris from exhaust stream having an efficiency rating greater than 99.5%. Removal of radioactive halogens, noble gases and vapor phase contaminants from a high flow exhaust stream with an efficiency rating greater than 99.5%. Applicable Integrated System Health Monitoring and autonomous test operations control systems. Modern robotics which can be used to inspect the ground test system exposed to a radiation environment. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards Phase II hardware/software demonstration with delivery of a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase I Deliverables - Feasibility study, including simulations and measurements, proving the proposed approach to develop a given product (TRL 2-3). Verification matrix of measurements to be performed at the end of Phase II, along with specific quantitative pass-fail ranges for each quantity listed. Phase II Deliverables - Working engineering model of proposed product, along with full report of component and/or breadboard validation measurements, including populated verification matrix from Phase I (TRL 4-5). Opportunities and plans should also be identified and summarized for potential commercialization. Read less>>"

Focus Area 2 Power Energy and Storage,"S3.03Power Electronics and Management, and Energy Storage", GRC," ARC, GSFC, JPL, JSC", TA3 Space Power and Energy Storage, 2017,"NASA’s science vision (http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2014/05/02/2014_Science_Plan-0501_tagged.pdf) is to use the vantage point of space to achieve with the science community and our partners a deep scientific understanding of the Sun and its effects on the solar system, our home planet, other planets and solar system bodies, the interplanetary environment, and the universe beyond. Scientific priorities for future planetary science missions are guided by the recommendations of the decadal surveys published by the National Academies. The goal of the decadal surveys is to articulate the priorities of the scientific community, and the surveys are therefore the starting point for NASA’s strategic planning process in science (http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2014/04/18/FY2014_NASA_StrategicPlan_508c.pdf). The most recent planetary science decadal survey, Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013 - 2022, was released in 2011. This report recommended a balanced suite of missions to enable a steady stream of new discoveries and capabilities to address challenges such as sample return missions and outer planet exploration. Under this subtopic, proposals are solicited to develop energy storage and power electronics to enable or enhance the capabilities of future NASA science missions. The unique requirements for the power systems for these missions can vary greatly, with advancements in components needed above the current State of the Art (SOA) for high energy density, high power density, long life, high reliability, low mass/volume, and wide temperature operation. Other subtopics which could potentially benefit from these technology developments include S4.04 Extreme Environments Technology, and S4.01 Planetary Entry, Descent and Landing Technology. This subtopic is also directly tied to S3.02 Propulsion Systems for Robotic Science Missions for the development of advanced Power Processing Units and associated components. Power Electronics and Management NASAs Planetary Science Division is working to implement a balanced portfolio within the available budget and based on the decadal survey that will continue to make exciting scientific discoveries about our solar system. This balanced suite of missions shows the need for low mass/volume power electronics and management systems and components that can operate in extreme environment for future NASA Science Missions. In addition, studying the Sun, the heliosphere, and other planetary environments as an interconnected system is critical for understanding the implications for Earth and humanity as we venture forth through the solar system. To that end, the NASA heliophysics program seeks to perform innovative space research missions to understand: The Sun and its variable activity. How solar activity impacts Earth and the solar system. Fundamental physical processes that are important at Earth and throughout the universe by using space as a laboratory. Heliophysics also seeks to enable research based on these missions and other sources to understand the connections among the Sun, Earth, and the solar system for science and to assure human safety and security both on Earth and as we explore beyond it. Advances in electrical power technologies are required for the electrical components and systems of these future spacecrafts/platforms to address program size, mass, efficiency, capacity, durability, and reliability requirements. Radioisotope power systems (RPS), Advanced Modular Power Systems (AMPS) and In-Space Electric Propulsion (ISP) are several programs of interest which would directly benefit from advancements in this technology area. These types of programs, including Mars Sample Return using Hall thrusters and power processing units (PPUs), require advancements in components and systems beyond the state-of-the-art. Of importance are expected improvements in energy density, speed, efficiency, or wide-temperature operation (-125° C to over 450° C) with a number of thermal cycles. Novel approaches to minimizing the weight of advanced PPUs are also of interest. Advancements are sought for power electronic devices, components, packaging and cabling for programs with power ranges of a few watts for minimum missions to up to 20 kilowatts for large missions. In addition to electrical component development, RPS has a need for intelligent, fault-tolerant Power Management and Distribution (PMAD) technologies to efficiently manage the system power for these deep space missions.

Non-traditional approaches to switching devices, such as addition of graphene and carbon nano-tubes to material. Lightweight, highly conductive power cables and/or cables integrated with vehicle structures. Intelligent power management and fault-tolerant electrical components and PMAD systems. Advanced electronic packaging for thermal control and electromagnetic shielding. Integrated packaging technology for modularity.

The Outer Planet Assessment Group and the 2011 PSD Relevant Technologies Document have specifically called out high energy density storage systems as a need for the Titan/Enceladus Flagship and planetary exploration missions. In addition, high energy-density rechargeable electrochemical battery systems that offer greater than 50,000 charge/discharge cycles (10 year operating life) for low-earth-orbiting spacecraft, 20 year life for geosynchronous (GEO) spacecraft, are desired. Advancements to battery energy storage capabilities that address one or more of the above requirements for the stated missions combined with very high specific energy and energy density (>200 Wh/kg for secondary battery systems), along with radiation tolerance are of interest. In addition to batteries, other advanced energy storage/load leveling technologies designed to the above mission requirements, such as mechanical or magnetic energy storage devices, are of interest.

Specifically, NASA is developing Solar Electric Propulsion systems that use Power Processing Units (PPUs) to convert the 300V solar array output to the 700V-2000V input level of an electric thruster. Although many diodes and transistors exist in the commercial market place that would represent significant improvements over the state of the art space-qualified components, these parts have failed to pass critical tests related to space qualification most importantly in terms of their radiation tolerance.

Focus Area 3 Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration,H6.02Resilient Autonomous Systems, ARC," JPL, JSC, MSFC"," TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems", 2017,"Future human spaceflight missions will place crews at large distances and light-time delays from Earth, requiring novel capabilities for crews with limited ground support to manage spacecraft, habitats, and supporting equipment to prevent Loss of Mission (LOM) or Loss of Crew (LOC) over extended duration missions. In particular, these capabilities are needed to handle faults leading to loss of critical function or unexpected expenditure of consumables. Expanded flight control functionality will be on-board spacecraft to support autonomy with significant automation, autonomy, and decision support software. The increasingly complex interconnectivity of these elements introduces new vulnerabilities within space systems that are sometimes impossible to predict. In that context, one key property of the respective system is its resilience to unforeseen events. Resilience, as defined by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences [1] (NAS), is the ability to plan and prepare for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events. Within this definition, resilience has two manifestations: engineering and ecological. Engineering resilience is focused on the ability of a system to absorb and recover from adverse events, while ecological resilience is focused on understanding how close a system is to collapse and reorganization. The engineering definition brings resilience principles such as robustness, redundancy, and modularity, while the ecological definition supports principles of flexibility, adaptability, and resourcefulness. To enable resilient behavior of a system (such as a vehicle, a habitat, a rover, etc.), ""resilience"" needs to be built-in during the design phase of the system development. To that end, the operational states of a system’s component need to be considered in conjunction with the intended function of the component and its possible failure modes throughout the vehicle's life cycle. Where possible, critical failures are eliminated during the design stage. For failure modes that cannot be eliminated, a mechanism needs to be designed that considers how to have optimal state awareness during operations and to mitigate the fault. Mitigation can be accomplished through fault avoidance, fault masking, or Fault Detection, Assessment, and Recovery (FDIR). FDIR can be realized through hardware or software solutions as well as by intervention of the mission crew or mission control. The detection / assessment / recovery process will involve identification of: Small variations in overall system performance that may “coincide and combine” to produce significant risk. Dependencies within the system that contribute to unforeseen increased risk. The strategies and solutions used by crew and controllers to run mission operations safely. Recovery/fallback mechanisms that help the human/technology system cope with foreseen and unforeseen operational conditions and events. The adaptability and flexibility needed to handle unpredictable and uncertain situations. The different technical, functional, and procedural features that can interact in a positive way to achieve mission success. Four processes characterize the emergence of resilience as a system property: Sensing - measuring new information about a system’s operating environment with focus on anomalous data. These data can alert system evaluators of overlooked possibilities. This process connects components in the physical domain to the information domain. Anticipation - imagining multiple future states without reducing improbability to impossibility; this includes incorporating the uncertainty in the future states and including the impact of such uncertainty on system operation. This process connects components in the information domain to the cognitive domain. Adaptation - reacting to changing conditions or uncertain states to restore critical functionality under altered conditions or operating environments. This process connects the cognitive domain to the physical domain. Learning - observing external conditions and system responses to improve understanding of relationships and possible futures, identifying needs for system improvement where applicable. This process links the physical, information, and cognitive domains together and can incorporate the social or human crew domain depending on the system studied. Since a vehicle is made up of many components, a system-of-system’s approach needs to be considered in a multi-objective optimization context to account for interdependencies and to realize possible mutually beneficial mitigation solutions for resiliency. Proposals to this subtopic should specify innovation and approaches toward two goals: Development of methods and tools that allow the assessment and optimization of system resilience during its conceptual design stage, while simultaneously maximizing reliability and safety. Development of measures and metrics that quantify the degree of resilience of a system with respect to a mission ConOps and hazard analysis. Resilience measures and metrics must be general enough to support broad applications, yet precise enough to measure system-specific qualities. Such metrics are necessary to make resource and operations decisions. Risk metrics tend to assess risks to individual components, ignoring system functionality as the result of interacting components. Resilience measures and metrics also need to account for uncertainty in the planned operation of the system, and focus on integrating statistical methods for uncertainty propagation into resilience-based design. Rather than the static view of systems and networks in risk assessment, resilience adopts a dynamic view. This means resilience metrics must also consider the ability of a system to plan, prepare, and adapt as adverse events occur, rather than focus entirely on threat prevention and mitigation. Finally, resilience depends upon specific qualities that risk assessment cannot quantify, such as system flexibility and interconnectedness. Proposed solutions are expected to have characteristics including (but not limited to): Life-cycle models (i.e., models that assess the resilience of the system over its entire life-cycle) that encapsulate cost/benefit of envisioned design solution and that can be used to inform about the resilience of the system. Models may need to be built at the appropriate fidelity level to capture relevant fault behavior. Models may need to assess behavior and consequences during degraded (or faulted) state. Models should also be able to assess mitigation actions that are part of an integrated health management approach. Design optimization methodology that can systematically incorporate health management solutions. Methods that integrate optimal decision-making into the design concept. Methods that make use of both system health models and observations to provide the best decision given the information available. Methodology to allow bi-directional exchange between a model and the analysis tool. Methods that systemically include desired levels of resilience in the design optimization process. Uncertainty management. Identify the various sources of uncertainty that affect system performance, and quantify their combined effect on both system failure and resilience. Systematically incorporate uncertainty in the design process, thereby incorporating both resilience and likelihood of failure directly during the design stage. This SBIR work aims to generate a practical toolkit for space systems that can deliver solutions with assured levels of performance, reliability and resilience, while accommodating: uncertainty; incomplete knowledge; sparsity, or high volumes, of data; and humans in the loop. Metrics for success include: Development of generic quantitative measures and metrics that evaluate system resilience, and their application to space relevant systems or subsystems. Demonstrated improvement of resilience over baseline design for at least two different space relevant systems or subsystems. Consideration of at least 3 different fault modes. Software tools must be able to accept other systems or subsystems through appropriate interface. SBIR work is expected to deliver mainly software in the form of tools used during the design stage and also prototype software that would manage resiliency during autonomous operations. For the latter, the SBIR effort should analyze sensors, computational hardware, and software stack: Resiliency for the computational system should also be addressed. In-space applications are preferred, but terrestrial analogues will be considered. Proposals must demonstrate mission operations risk reduction through appropriate metrics; Deliverables: tools developed, algorithms and any data generated in simulations or experiments.

Focus Area 3 Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration,H6.03Spacecraft Autonomous Agent Cognitive Architectures for Human Exploration, ARC," JSC, MSFC"," TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems", 2017,"Future human spaceflight missions will place crews at long distances from Earth causing significant communication lag due to the light distance as well as occasional complete loss of communication with Earth. Novel artificial intelligence capabilities augmenting crews will be required for them to autonomously manage spacecraft operations and interact with Earth mission control under these conditions, including spacecraft and systems health, crew health, maintenance, consumable management, payload management, training, as well as activities such as food production and recycling. Autonomous agents with cognitive architectures would be able to interface directly with the crew as well as with the onboard systems and mission control, thus reducing the cognitive loads on the crew as well as performing many tasks that would otherwise require scheduling crew time. In addition, this cognitive computing capability is necessary in many circumstances to respond to off-nominal events that overload the crew; particularly when the event limits crew activity, such as high-radiation or loss of atmospheric pressure events. In deep space, crews will be required to manage, plan, and execute the mission more autonomously than is currently done on the International Space Station (ISS); which from Low Earth Orbit has instantaneous ground support. NASA expects to migrate significant portions of current operations functionality from Earth flight control to deep-space spacecraft to be performed autonomously. These functionalities will be performed jointly by the crew and cognitive agents supervised by the crew; so the crew is not overburdened. Cognitive agents that can effectively communicate with the crew could perform tasks that would otherwise require crew time by providing assistance, directly operating spacecraft systems, providing training, performing inspections, and providing crew consulting among other tasks. Due to the complexity of such cognitive agents and the need for them to be continually updated, their software architecture is required to be modular. A requirement for the cognitive software architecture is that modules can dynamically be added, removed, and enhanced. Types of modules would likely include a smart executive, state estimator, planner/scheduler, diagnostics and prognostics, goal manager, etc. Other modules that may be supported include a dialog manager, risk manager, image recognition, instructional drawing, crew task manager, etc. This type of modular cognitive architecture is consistent with that proposed by Prof. Marvin Minsky in ""The Society of Mind"", 1988, and subsequent proposals and realizations of cognitive agents. Recent venues for cognitive architectures include: ICCM (http://acs.ist.psu.edu/iccm2016/(link is external)) and CogArch 2016 @ ASPLOS (http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=5848(link is external)). Due to NASA's need for fail-safe capabilities, such as continued functionality during high-radiation events, the cognitive architecture will be required to be capable of supporting multiple processes executing on multiple processors, in order to meet the expected computational loads as well as be robust to processor failure. Cognitive architectures capable of being certified for crew support on spacecraft are also required to be open to NASA with interfaces open to NASA partners who develop modules that integrate with other modules on the cognitive agent in contrast to proprietary black-box agents. Note that a cognitive agent suitable to provide crew support on spacecraft may also be suitable for a variety of Earth applications, but the converse is not true; thus requiring this NASA investment. The emphasis of proposed efforts are expected to be on analyzing and demonstrating the feasibility of various configurations, capabilities, and limitations of a cognitive architecture suitable for crew support on deep space missions. The software engineering of a cognitive architecture is to be documented and demonstrated by implementing a prototype goal-directed cognitive agent that interacts with simulated spacecraft systems and humans. For Phase I, a preliminary cognitive architecture, preliminary feasibility study, a cognitive agent prototype that supports a human operating a simulate complex system that illustrates a candidate cognitive agent architecture, and a detailed plan to develop a comprehensive cognitive architecture feasibility study are expected. For Phase II, it is expected that the proposed detailed feasibility study plan is executed. In Phase II it is expected that a comprehensive cognitive architecture will be generated, along with a demonstration of an agent prototype that instantiates the architecture. The agent prototype should interact with a spacecraft simulator and humans executing a plausible HEOMD design reference mission beyond cis-lunar (e.g., Human Exploration of Mars Design Reference Mission: https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/373665main_NASA-SP-2009-566.pdf). Phase II deliverables are also expected to include a comprehensive feasibility study report, and a detailed plan to develop a fully instantiated robust cognitive architecture suitable for proposing to NASA and other organizations interested in funding a flight capability. A Phase II prototype suitable for a compelling flight experiment or simulation interfacing with the ISS or a spacecraft-relevant robotic system is encouraged. Read less>>"
Focus Area 4 Robotic Systems for Space Exploration,"S4.02Robotic Mobility, Manipulation and Sampling", JPL," AFRC, ARC, GSFC, JSC"," TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems", 2017,"Technologies for robotic mobility, manipulation, and sampling are needed to enable access to sites of interest and acquisition and handling of samples for in-situ analysis or return to Earth from planetary and solar system small bodies including Mars, Venus, comets, asteroids, and planetary moons. Application to Ocean Worlds is of increasing importance. Mobility technologies are needed to enable access to steep and rough terrain for planetary bodies where gravity dominates, such as the Moon and Mars. Wheeled, legged, and aerial solutions are of interest. Wheel concepts with good tractive performance in loose sand while being robust to harsh rocky terrain are of interest. Technologies to enable mobility on small bodies and access to liquid bodies below the surface such as in conduits and deep oceans are desired, as well as associated sampling technologies. Manipulation technologies are needed to deploy sampling tools to the surface and transfer samples to in-situ instruments and sample storage containers, as well as hermetic sealing of sample chambers. On-orbit manipulation of a Mars sample cache canister is needed from capture to transfer into an Earth Entry Vehicle. Sample acquisition tools are needed to acquire samples on planetary and small bodies through soft and hard materials, including ice. Minimization of mass and ability to work reliably in the harsh mission environment are important characteristics for the tools. Design for planetary protection and contamination control is important for sample acquisition and handling systems. Component technologies for low-mass and low-power systems tolerant to the in-situ environment are of particular interest. Technical feasibility should be demonstrated during Phase I and a full capability unit of at least TRL 4 should be delivered in Phase II. Proposals should show an understanding of relevant science needs and engineering constraints and present a feasible plan to fully develop a technology and infuse it into a NASA program.

Focus Area 4 Robotic Systems for Space Exploration,Z5.01Payload Technologies for Free-Flying Robots, ARC," JPL, JSC"," TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems", 2017,"The objective of this subtopic is to develop technology that can be integrated as external payloads on free-flying robots that operate in human environments and/or assist humans performing structured tasks. Current free-flyers include space robots, micro UAVs, quadcopters, etc. Applications of free-flying robots to space exploration include: Supporting deep-space human exploration spacecraft and habitats (operating inside or outside to support critical maintenance and monitoring functions). Supporting astronaut extra-vehicular activity (EVA) with scouting, follow-up sensing, and tool/sample delivery. On the International Space Station (ISS), for example, the SPHERES robots have shown how free-flying robots can perform environment surveys, inspection, and crew support. In addition, STMD is currently developing the ""Astrobee"" free-flying robot to perform mobile camera, mobile sensor, and microgravity robotics testing on the ISS starting in 2018. Proposals are sought to create payloads that can be integrated with small-scale free-flying robots, including (but not limited to) the following areas: Sensors - Compact sensors relevant to the scenarios listed above, including functions such as interior environment monitoring (e.g., air quality), interior/exterior structural inspection, free-flying navigation (obstacle detection and localization), 3D environment modeling, etc. End Effectors - Small, lightweight mechanisms that can be used for docking/perching, prodding/pushing, tool carrying, and deployment of RFID tags. This may include deployable structures, universal end-effectors (e.g., jamming granular gripper), devices incorporating gecko or electrostatic adhesion, and devices that can interact with handles, storage lockers, and small IVA tools. Note: complete robot manipulator arms are NOT being solicited. Human-Robot Interfaces - Payloads that facilitate communication and coordination between humans (local and remote) and AFFs. This includes displays (3D screens, projectors, etc.), signaling devices (light indicators, sound generation, etc.), and human monitoring (activity recognition, gaze/motion tracking, etc.). Novel Subsystems - Payloads that can be used to enhance the performance or the capability of AFFs for future deep-space exploration missions. This includes subsystems for extended AFF operations (power systems, efficient propulsion, etc.), supporting crew (e.g., mobile health monitoring), spacecraft ""caretaking"" (routine maintenance and emergency response), and other use cases. Proposers are encouraged to target the development of these payload technologies to the Astrobee free-flying robot. For Astrobee, payloads should ideally be less than 1 kg in mass, consume less than 5 W electrical power (5 VDC @ 1 A), interface via USB 2.0, and stow within a 10x10x10 cm volume. Payloads that exceed these specifications (e.g., in terms of power) may still target Astrobee, but may require special accommodations (e.g., independent power). Proposals must describe how the technology will make a significant improvement over the current state of the art, rather than just an incremental enhancement, for a specific free-flying robotic application.

Focus Area 4 Robotic Systems for Space Exploration,Z5.02Robotic Systems - Mobility Subsystems, JSC," ARC, GRC, KSC"," TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems", 2017,"In the coming decades, robots will continue to change the way space is explored. Robots will be used in all mission phases: as independent explorers operating in environments too distant or hostile for humans, as precursor systems operating before crewed missions, as crew helpers working alongside and supporting humans, and as caretakers of assets left behind. As humans continue to work and live in space, they will increasingly rely on intelligent and versatile robots to perform mundane activities, freeing human and ground control teams to tend to more challenging tasks that call for human cognition and judgment. Innovative robot technologies provide a critical capability for space exploration. Multiple forms of mobility, manipulation and human robot interaction offer great promise in exploring planetary bodies for science investigations and to support human missions. Enhancements and potentially new forms of robotic systems can be realized through advances in component technologies, such as actuation and structures. Manipulation provides a critical capability for positioning crew members and instruments in space and on planetary bodies, it allows for the handling of tools, interfaces, and materials not specifically designed for robots, and it provides a capability for drilling, extracting, handling and processing samples of multiple forms and scales. This increases the range of beneficial tasks robots can perform and allows for improved efficiency of operations across mission scenarios. Manipulation is important for human missions, human precursor missions, and unmanned science missions. Future space missions may rely on co-located and distributed teams of humans and robots that have complementary capabilities. Tasks that are considered ""dull, dirty, or dangerous"" can be transferred to robots, thus relieving human crew members to perform more complex tasks or those requiring real-time modifications due to contingencies. Additionally, due to the limited number of astronauts anticipated to crew planetary exploration missions, as well as their constrained schedules, ground control will need to remotely supervise and assist robots using time-delayed and limited bandwidth communications. Proposals are sought to research and develop the following robotic technologies including mobility, manipulation and human robot interaction technologies as described by the 2015 NASA Technology Roadmap for Robotics and Autonomous Systems (Tech Area 4): Extreme Terrain Mobility - Technology to access and traverse extreme terrain topographies, such as highly-sloped crater walls, gullies, and canyons; soft terrains; or terrains with large rock densities. Key technologies include rappelling and climbing systems and systems that can traverse soft and friable terrains. Below-Surface Mobility - Technology to access through naturally-occurring terrain cavities, such as lava tubes and deep crevasses; through human-made holes, ice boreholes, or trenches; and through granular or liquid media. Challenges include lack of direct sunlight, or line-of-sight comm. Key technologies include anchoring, burrowing, traction, downhole sensing, and tethering components. Above-Surface Mobility - Technology to provide longer range and greater coverage of planetary surfaces, independent of the terrain topography. This includes improvements to payload capacity, power, speed, and endurance in terms of time or distance. The type of above-surface mobility used on planetary bodies will be driven by environmental considerations and mission-specific requirements, which would include operation duration, coasting attitude, and the frequency of contacts with the surface. Small-Body and Microgravity Mobility - Technology to provide surface coverage and in-situ access to designated targets on small bodies with low gravity, as well as in-space mobility inside and around the ISS or other future space assets. Key technologies include human-safe gas propulsion, fan-based propulsion, hopping, flying, anchoring, wheel/track/limb hybrids, and electromagnetic formation flight. Surface Mobility - Technology to transport payloads, equipment, and other surface assets at much higher traverse speed for both manned and unmanned missions and increase the robustness of their onboard sensing, control, and navigation software. Key technologies include active suspension, traction control, real-time embedding/slip detection, and tractive elements (wheels, tracks, etc.) Robot Navigation - Technology to provide a highly reliable, well-characterized, and autonomous or semi-autonomous mobility capability to navigate to targets of interest on planetary surfaces. Key technologies include perception algorithms, pose and state estimation algorithms, and on-board autonomy (motion/path planning, target/waypoint selection, etc.). Mobility Components - Provide critical component technologies, such as compliant long-life wheels, high-torque at low speed actuators, energy-efficient and miniaturized actuators, strong abrasion-resistant tethers, and all-terrain anchors to meet future mobility needs. Provide larger payload and mobility mass fractions. Provide safe movement at speeds that are power-limited, not computation-limited, and yet do not tax human attention. Manipulator Components - Technologies should address improving kinematic configuration (serial, parallel, hybrids), dynamic performance (variable structural stiffness or compliant actuation), packaging efficiency (stowed and deployed), power density, or payload to mass ratio. This includes actuators tailored for manipulation (in terms of speed and torque range, compliance, size, and mass), lightweight structures (soft mechanisms, tendon systems, etc.), sensors and sensing approaches (both proprioceptive and exteroceptive), and embedded controllers (impedance, compliance, torque, etc.). Dexterous Manipulation - Technologies to generate smooth, human-like arm trajectories and fine end-effector motions that can flexibly manipulate objects; systems and control approaches capable of interacting with unstructured environments and human arm/hand scale interfaces; and approaches to incorporating or leveraging redundancy for robust manipulation. This includes manipulators and end-effectors, as well as the algorithms that control their motions. Collaborative Manipulation - Technologies to enable the use of multiple robotic manipulators that are either rigidly connected to a common base or to independent mobile bases. This includes algorithms and software for coordinated and cooperative motion, multi-point contact management (for highly dexterous robots or multi-robot systems), and distributed safety. Grappling - Technologies to handle large objects in microgravity environments. This includes components to grapple natural and human-made free-flying objects using surface features, and then to berth these objects to the robot’s spacecraft through a rigidized interface. Multi-Modal Interaction - Technology that employs multiple display modalities and multiple communication channels to enhance human situation awareness and enable more efficient interaction. In particular, tools and techniques that combine interactive 3D computer graphics, multi-modal dialogue, haptics, spatialized sound, and other non-visual displays to create an increased sense of presence are of strong interest. Distributed Collaboration and Coordination - Technology that improves the operational efficiency of a distributed team of humans and robots. This includes performance monitoring systems for real-time evaluation of task execution; summarization and notification systems to help humans understand robot state and trends over time; and physics-based modeling and modeling/simulation of robots and their operational environments. Variable Autonomy Robotic Interaction - Technology that enables humans, both on Earth and in-mission to more effectively operate and supervise robots that may be remote or proximal. This includes decision support tools to monitor system status, assess task progress, observe the remote environment, and make informed operational decisions; interaction techniques that inspire humans to trust robot team members that are proximal and/or remote; techniques to mitigate the effects of latency on manual control; and methods to reduce dependency on high-bandwidth, high-availability communication links. Proposals must describe how the technology will make a significant improvement over the current state of the art, rather than just an incremental enhancement. Proposals must also describe how the technology will be employed for a specific application and how performance will be quantitatively assessed. Read less>>"

Focus Area 5 Communications and Navigation,H9.02Intelligent Communication Systems, GRC, JPL, TA5 Communication and Navigation, 2017,"NASA’s RF and optical systems require increased levels of adaptive, cognitive, and autonomous system technologies to improve mission communication for science and exploration. Goals of this capability are to improve communications efficiency, mitigate impairments (e.g., scintillation, interference), and reduce operations complexity and costs through intelligent and autonomous communications and data handling. Cognition and automation have the potential to improve system performance, increase data volume return, and reduce user spacecraft burden to improve science return from NASA missions. These goals are further described in the TA05 Communications, Navigation, and Orbital Debris Tracking and Characterization Systems Roadmap, Sections 5.2.1, 5.3.1, 5.3.2, 5.3.3, 5.3.4, 5.5.1, 5.5.2, and 5.5.3. This solicitation seeks advancements in cognitive and automation communication systems, components, and platforms. While there are a number of acceptable definitions of cognitive systems/radio, for simplicity, a cognitive system should sense, detect, adapt, and learn from its environment to optimize the communications capabilities and situational awareness for the network infrastructure and/or the mission. Areas of interest to develop and/or demonstrate are as follows: Flexible and Adaptive Space Hardware Systems - Signal processing platforms (transceivers) with novel (e.g., low power, small volume, high capacity) processing technology, wideband (e.g., across or among frequency bands of interest), tunable, and adaptive front ends for RF (S-, X-, and Ka-bands) or optical communications, and other intelligent electronics/avionics which advances or enables flexible, cognitive, and intelligent operations. System Wide Intelligence - while much of the current research often describes negotiations and link improvements between two radio nodes, the subtopic also seeks to understand system wide, architectural aspects and impacts of this new technology. Areas of interest include (but not limited to): cognitive architectures considering mission spacecraft, relay satellites, other user spacecraft, and ground stations. System wide effects to decisions made by one or more communication/navigation elements, handling unexpected or undesired decisions, self-configuring networks, coordination among multiple spacecraft nodes in a multiple access scheme, cooperation and planning among networked space elements to efficiently and securely move data through the system to optimize data throughput and reduce operations costs. Network Operation - Optimization of the various layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model has several aspects applicable to cognitive applications. Knowledge from one layer may be useful to optimize performance at a different layer. As the future space communication architecture progresses towards a more on-demand, ad-hoc, network-based architecture for data delivery among user spacecraft and relay satellite or from user spacecraft direct to ground stations new technologies are needed to securely provide assured data delivery through the network. Areas of interest include intelligent network routing (best route selection) through quality of service metrics and learning, store and forward data protocols over cognitive links, and advanced network management. Node-to-Node Link Adaptation - New capabilities for communication radios (hardware and software) to sense and adapt to the mission environment (for both RF and optical systems). Areas of interest include interference mitigation, spectrum cooperation, signal identification, maximizing data throughput and efficiency, learned operation between user spacecraft and relay (or ground) or direct to ground station communications. For all technologies, Phase I will emphasize aspects for technical feasibility, clear and achievable benefits (e.g., 2x-5x increase in throughput, 25-50% reduction in power, improved quality of service or efficiency, reduction in operations staff or costs) and show a path towards Phase II hardware/software development with delivery of specific hardware or software product for NASA. Demonstrate and explain how and where cognitive and automation technologies could be applied to NASA space systems. Phase I Deliverables - Feasibility study and concept of operations of the research topic, including simulations and measurements, validating the proposed approach to develop a given product (TRL 3-4). Early development and delivery of the simulation and prototype software and platform(s) to NASA. Plan for further development and verification of specific capabilities or products to be performed at the end of Phase II. Phase II Deliverables - Working engineering model of proposed product/platform or software delivery, along with documentation of development, capabilities, and measurements (showing specific improvement metrics).

Focus Area 5 Communications and Navigation,H9.03Flight Dynamics and Navigation Technology, GSFC, MSFC, TA5 Communication and Navigation, 2017,"Future NASA missions will require precision landing, rendezvous, formation flying, cooperative robotics, proximity operations (e.g., servicing), and coordinated platform operations.

Focus Area 5 Communications and Navigation,H9.04Advanced RF Communications, JPL," GRC, GSFC, MSFC", TA5 Communication and Navigation, 2017,"This subtopic is focused on development of innovative Advanced RF Platform technologies, at the physical layer, supporting the needs of space missions in the areas of both communications and RF sensors. In the future, robotic and human exploration vehicles with increasingly capable instruments producing large quantities of data will be investigating Earth, extraterrestrial moons, planets and asteroids. These vehicles, especially those that visit the surfaces of these myriad destinations, will be tightly constrained in the areas of mass, volume and energy. Our historical method of implementing single function elements such as short and long‐range data and voice radios as well as short‐range radar sensors does not lend itself to mass, volume or energy efficiencies that can support future resource challenged platforms. One method of enhancing limited resources is to leverage recent advances in the areas of Reconfigurable Software Defined Radio (SDR) Digital Signal Processing (DSP) technologies as well as RF components, materials and packaging to create advanced multifunction RF platforms. Recent advances in high speed digital electronics, especially where clock speeds exist in the range of several GHz, have blurred the lines between what was traditionally considered “analog” and digital”. Digital signal processing techniques with multi‐GHz clock rates can generate arbitrary user‐defined analog waveforms at RF frequencies as never before. These waveforms, when coupled with advanced RF electronics focused on S‐Band through Ka‐Band frequencies, greatly improve the functionality, performance and utility of space‐based communications devices. This naturally leads to advanced multi‐function RF platforms; platforms that serve more than one user or function and are reconfigurable, on‐demand, by the user for arbitrary applications. The commercial cellphone and wireless industries have been highly successful in developing multifunction RF and wireless platforms that serve a broad range of customers. NASA can leverage these techniques, hardware, algorithms and waveforms developed by industry for use in space applications. However, in order to leverage this increased level of configurability, functionality and performance, NASA needs to further invest in technologies for two key areas: Advanced waveform development in the digital domain. Specifically: the foundation has been laid through prior NASA investments in the area of generating the infrastructure for software‐based algorithms. These investments led to the development and demonstration of the Space Telecommunication Radio System (STRS) architectural standard for software‐defined radios. Now that the architecture has been instantiated, the next logical step in NASA’s investment portfolio is the development of actual application backend platforms and waveforms that meet this architectural standard. Advanced backend platforms generate (for transmission) or process (from reception) the appropriate waveform at a common Intermediate Frequency (IF) for transmission to, or reception from, an appropriate RF front‐end. In addition, the backend processor is reconfigurable, by the user, for a specific application at a given time (radar vs. short range communications link, etc.). The development and demonstration of advanced RF Front‐Ends that cover NASA RF bands of interest; specifically, S‐Band, X‐Band and/or Ka‐Band. These RF front‐ends may support time multiplexed waveforms such as radar or (digitized) half‐duplex voice transmissions as well as frequency duplexed waveforms such as full‐duplex two‐way navigation and data communications. Specifically, these front‐ends are expected to leverage state‐of‐the‐art RF materials (e.g., GaN, SiC, CMOS, etc.), packaging (e.g., MIC, SMT, etc.), device (e.g., MMIC, MEMS, etc.) and component techniques to minimize mass, volume and energy resource usage while supporting multi‐functionality. In implementing these multifunction RF Front‐Ends, we must note that there are three key functions embedded within these front‐ends that require further development: High Efficiency Microwave Power Amplifiers - Compact, lightweight, space qualifiable Ka‐band solid‐state power amplifiers (SSPAs) with integrated electronic power conditioner that can deliver an output power on the order of 10 to 20 Watts (CW) with bandwidth on the order of 1% to 2% and mass less than 1 kg is of interest to NASA. In addition, low‐noise amplifiers (LNAs) with noise figures on the order of a dB or less is of interest to NASA. Since overall efficiency is of paramount importance for low dc power consumption, efficiency enhancement techniques are of interest. Furthermore, SSPAs with good linearity and capable of functioning in tandem with software defined radios (SDRs) for amplifying spectrally efficient digital modulation format signals are also of interest. Electronically Steered Antennas - Electronically steered antennas, especially at Ka‐Band, are of interest. Applications include large, high‐performance electronicallysteered antennas required for a dedicated communications relay spacecraft with multiple simultaneous connections, advanced multifunction antennas to support science missions that utilize a multifunction antenna to both communicate and conduct science, and small, lightweight antennas for communications only that provide moderate gain without the use of mechanical steering. Antennas that are reconfigurable in frequency, polarization, and radiation pattern that reduce the number of antennas needed to meet the communication requirements of NASA missions are desired. Ultrawideband (UWB) Antennas and Electronics - Recent developments in commercial chipsets and antennas that implement UWB modulation techniques are of interest to NASA. Advanced signal processing techniques that can leverage investments made in the commercial communications industry for space applications as well as UWB antennas that function in the standard NASA S/X/Ka‐Band frequency ranges are of interest to NASA. This includes modulation and demodulation techniques and algorithms for UWB signal transmission and reception. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards Phase II hardware/software demonstration with delivery of a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase I Deliverables - Feasibility study, including simulations and measurements, proving the proposed approach to develop a given product (TRL 3‐4). Verification matrix of measurements to be performed at the end of Phase II, along with specific quantitative pass-fail ranges for each quantity listed. Phase II Deliverables - Working engineering model of proposed product, along with full report of development and measurements, including populated verification matrix from Phase I (TRL 5‐6). Opportunities and plans should also be identified and summarized for potential commercialization. Read less>>"

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,H3.01Habitat Outfitting, JSC," LaRC, MSFC"," TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems", 2017,"Early definition of habitat outfitting for a vehicle is important because it will influence the overall vehicle architecture and layout. Vehicle outfitting provides the equipment necessary for the crew to perform mission tasks as well as provide them a comfortable, safe and livable habitable volume. Effective and efficient human-system interfaces and interactions are critical and should be considered as an integral part of this effort and demonstrated. Integrated outfitting is often a distributed hardware set that operates in unison or independently to perform a habitation function. Outfitting includes secondary structure (e.g., floors and walls), crew structures (e.g., crew quarters, radiation storm shelters) as well as the distribution of outfitting items (e.g., crew personal items) and utilities (e.g., avionics, ventilation, lighting) to sustain the crew during a mission. Habitat features and capabilities that allow autonomous monitoring or robotic interaction of items to enable habitat outfitting (e.g., high accuracy localization systems or mounting approaches) prior to crew arrival or after crew departure are also of interest. Concepts that can reuse launch support structure for outfitting are advantageous if it can be done without significant or with no crew interaction. Concepts should be capable of outfitting habitats with diameters of 3-8 meters and lengths of 4-10 meters. Habitat atmospheric pressure may vary from 0-1 atm for launch and 0.5-1 atm during crew usage. The following habitat outfitting specific habitat outfitting areas are requested. Interior Structures Deployable, inflatable, 3D printable from processed launch packaging, reusable secondary structure, and crew structures for outfitting the vehicle habitable volume. Concepts should not be constrained to the ISS rack geometry or attachments. Concepts must be volumetrically and mass efficient, and have a metric less than 25 kg/m3 for an enclosed volume. Proposed technologies that provide a surface area (e.g., floor) or utility (e.g., plumbing) should define a normalized metric (e.g., kg/ m2 or kg/m/plumbing run). The selection of non-metallic materials is very important in a spacecraft and will need to meet off-gassing and flammability requirements. Concepts should also have surfaces that either resist the accumulation of dust and dander or are readily cleanable. Structures should include appropriate factors of safety and assumptions should be included in the proposal. Concepts should be capable of sustaining launch loads (which can be in a stowed configuration) of 6g axial and 2g lateral. Crew structures must be capable of withstanding crew kick loads of 125 lbs when fully deployed. Concepts that are also applicable to habitat and life support equipment mounting are desirable. Autonomous Outfitting Capabilities Development of features and systems are required that can enable habitat structures, crew equipment, logistics, and trash to be interacted with autonomously with no direct crew involvement. Requested capabilities are rapid identification, localization in 3D space (including pose or orientation), and interaction with items. The intent is to allow robotic interaction with items prior to crew arrival and after crew departure. This may include deployment of interior structures, maintenance of the habitat, or monitoring of the habitat including health and status of items. Systems may also enable or facilitate human-machine interactions by providing greater situational awareness. Development of the robotic elements themselves are excluded from this subtopic. Mechanisms, electro-mechanical, and software applications and algorithms that enable autonomous outfitting and maintenance capability are requested. Dependencies on batteries are highly undesirable. Concepts that provide significant automated vehicle health monitoring should consider submission to the 'Autonomous Systems' topic.

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,H3.02Environmental Monitoring for Spacecraft Cabins, JPL," ARC, JSC, MSFC"," TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems", 2017,"Environmental Monitoring is comprised of the following four monitoring disciplines: air, water, microbial and acoustics. ISS has employed a wide variety of analytical instruments to deal with critical items. These functional needs are required to address identified risks to crew health during Exploration-class missions. The current approach onboard ISS, if any, will serve as the logical starting point to meeting the functional needs. However, the following limitations were found common to all the current approaches on-board ISS for any missions beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO): reliance on return sample and ground analysis, require too much crew time, constraints on size, mass, and power, lack of portability, and insufficient calibration life. Hence a concerted effort is underway to address these gaps and mature those solutions to ground and flight technology demonstrations. Technologies that show improvements in miniaturization, reliability, life-time, self-calibration, and reduction of expendables are of interest. In-Line Silver Monitoring Technologies NASA is interested in sensing technologies for the in-line measurement of ionic silver in spacecraft potable water systems. Overall, the sensing technology should offer small, robust, lightweight, low-power, compatible design solutions capable of stable, continuous, and autonomous measurements of silver for extended periods of time. Sensors of particular interest would provide: Continuous in-line measurement of ionic silver at concentrations between 0 and, at least, 1000 parts per billion (ppb); A minimum detection limit of 10 ppb or less; Measurement accuracies of at least 2.5% full scale (1000 ppb); Stable measurements in flows up to 0.5 L/min and pipe diameters up to ¾ inch; High sampling frequency, e.g., up to 1 measurement per minute; Stable calibration, greater than 3 years preferred; Minimal and/or no maintenance requirements; Operation at ambient temperature, system pressures up to 30 PSIG, and a solution pH between 4.5 - 9.0; A volumetric footprint less than 2000 cubic centimeters; Input/output signal(s) capable of interfacing with small embedded controllers, e.g., 4-20 mA or 0 – 5 V. In addition, the sensing technology should have a little to no impact on the overall volume, portability and concentration of silver being maintained within the spacecraft water system. Sample Processing Module for the ISS Microbial Monitors NASA continues to invest in the near- and mid-term development of highly-desirable systems and technologies that provide innovative ways to monitor microbial burden and enable to meet required cleanliness level of the closed habitat. To date, developing sample collection module and sample detection PCR systems such as RAZOR, Wet-lab 2 systems are planned for surface, water, and air. The sample collection and sample concentration modules are being developed but biomolecule (DNA, protein, etc.) processing and subsequent sample transfer modules that could deliver biological materials to the sample detection systems (PCR, microarray, sequencers, etc.) are not matured. More importantly, the future sample processing/transfer module should be compatible with existing NASA sample detection PCR systems. NASA is interested in an integrated sample collection/concentration/extraction system that could feed samples to conventional or molecular microbial monitoring techniques. The scope of this solicitation is the sample processing and sample transfer systems. Furthermore, integration of sample collection, concentration steps and a sample delivery to the molecular instruments (such as PCR) as a single module is solicited. Required technology characteristics include: 2-year shelf-life and functionality in microgravity and low pressure environment (~8 psi). Technologies that show improvements in miniaturization, reliability, life-time, self-calibration, and reduction of expendables are also of interest. The proposed integrated sample collection/concentration/extraction delivery system for molecular microbial monitoring detection should be capable of collecting all kinds of microorganisms as well as identifying “problematic” microbial species on-board ISS (ISS MORD: SSP 50260; http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf(link is external)). Existing PCR systems are: Biofire’s Razor (http://biofiredefense.com/razorex/(link is external)) and Cephied’s Smart Cycler (http://www.cepheid.com/us/cepheid-solutions/systems/smartcycler(link is external)). Hydrazine Measurement Technology NASA currently has hydrazine measurement technology that is sensitive, selective, and reliable – but the time to make the measurement is relatively slow. It takes 15 minutes to collect and analyze a sample. This is operationally acceptable for the current operational environment, but future missions will likely need a hydrazine measurement capability that responds more quickly. The primary use of the Hydrazine Monitor is for measurements of spacecraft cabin atmosphere. NASA is especially interested in systems with the following performance parameters: Hydrazine lower detection limit of 1 ppm when measured in STP conditions. Ammonia / hydrazine selectivity ratio of 25:1 or better (e.g., background concentrations of 50ppm ammonia will measure as no more than 2 ppm hydrazine). Response time (T90) or 30 seconds or faster. Measurement range of 1 ppm to 1000 ppm. Instrument size smaller than 2500 cubic centimeters. Read less>>"
Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,H3.03Environmental Control and Life Support, JSC," ARC, GRC, MSFC"," TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems", 2017,"Spacecraft Cabin Carbon Dioxide Removal NASA currently has CO2 removal and capture systems that are compact and effective, but future missions may require CO2 capture technology that control to lower levels, and operate with greater power efficiency. NASA is especially interested in systems with the following performance parameters: Removal rate of 4 kg/day. Operate in an environment with 1.5 mmHg ppCO2. System size 0.3 cubic meters. System power use 500 watts of power. Effectively separate out water vapor (less than 100 ppm water vapor in the CO2 product is desired). Oxygen Separation from Air NASA mission planners envision future mission scenarios that require oxygen separation from spacecraft cabin air. New technology developments show promise for reliable, low power performance. System safety, and the ability to easily verify oxygen product purity are especially important. Reliable operation without service or repair is key, but many R&D designs cannot report Mean Time Between Failure. If MTBF data is not available, an assessment of reliability should be provided. Although pressurization of product oxygen is not the intent of this call, future requirements for oxygen delivery pressure are variable, depending on mission scenario: some scenarios use ambient pressure (<5psig) oxygen, while other scenarios intend to store oxygen at pressures as high as 3600 psig. NASA is interested in systems with the following performance parameters: Production rate: 15 slpm. Power use: ≤450 W (30 Watts/liter). Sound level: <45 dB. System size: 0.03 cubic meters (200 cc/liter). Carbon Repurposing Several oxygen recovery technologies currently under consideration for future long-duration missions involve production of solid carbon. For technologies whose goal is to maximize oxygen recovery by producing this carbon, approximately 1 kg of solid carbon must be disposed of or repurposed daily for a crew of four. Repurposing this carbon will reduce logistical challenges associated with disposal and will ultimately result in materials or processes advantageous to long-duration missions. The carbon product includes nanofibers, microfibers, and amorphous carbon. It may contain quantities of metals including, but not limited to iron, nickel, and cobalt. Venting or disposal of this carbon to space will present considerable logistical challenges and will result in large volumes of space debris. Disposal of this carbon on a planetary surface may result in concerns for Planetary Protection or science. NASA is seeking technology and/or processes that repurpose solid carbon and its contaminants and that result in useful products for transit, deep space, or planetary surface missions. Filtration of Particulate Carbon and Hydrocarbons from Process Gas Streams Oxygen recovery technology options almost universally result in particulates in the form of solid carbon or solid hydrocarbons. Mitigation for these particulates will be essential to the success and maintainability of these systems during long duration missions. Techniques and methods leading to compact, regenerable methods for removing residual particulate matter generated from Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) system process equipment such as carbon formation reactors and methane plasma pyrolysis reactors is desirable for long-duration manned life support. Filtration performance approaching HEPA rating is desired for ultrafine particulate matter with minimal pressure drop. The gas filter should be capable of operating for hours at high particle loading rates and then employ techniques and methods to restore its capacity back to nearly 100% of its original clean state through in-place and autonomous regeneration or self-cleaning operation. The device must minimize crew exposure to accumulated particulate matter and enable easy particulate matter disposal or chemical repurposing. Solid State Microwave Generator for Environmental Control and Life Support Many possible future technologies for human spaceflight may utilize microwave energy, including plasma pyrolysis of methane, incineration and solid waste drying, and ovens for food heating. Traditional microwave generating systems have significant inefficiencies resulting in a high mass, high volume power system. Solid state microwave generators have the potential to limit the total mass and volume of a microwave power system. However, limited advancement has been achieved at power levels of 1kW and higher. NASA is seeking solid state microwave generators with the following capabilities: Microwaves generated and controlled at 2.38-2.54GHz (nominally 2.45GHz). Maximum output power level capability of 1-5kW. Variable power output over entire range (0-max kW). Input power of 120VDC. Efficiency greater than or equal to 50%. Method of measuring/monitoring output power. Method of measuring/monitoring reflected power. Method of dispersing/absorbing reflected power up to maximum output power.

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,H3.04Logistics Reduction, JSC," ARC, LaRC"," TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems", 2017,"All human space missions, regardless of destination, require significant logistical mass and volume that is directly proportional to mission duration. As our exploration missions increase in distance and duration, logistics reduction becomes even more important since they may need to be pre-deployed 2-5 years before a crew arrives. Reducing the initial mass and volume of supplies, or reusing items that have been launched, will be very valuable. Logistics unique to a spacecraft system (i.e., life support and propulsion) are not addressed by this subtopic and are not requested. Three of the largest logistics consumables are the logistical packaging (e.g., cargo bags, foam, retention straps, and cargo support pallets), clothing, and food. Approximately 1,000 cargo bags (0.053 m3 each) may be required for a Mars mission's logistics. Cargo is typically packed in foam, placed in a bag, and strapped to the vehicle or a cargo pallet/structure in the vehicle. Clothing is currently disposed of on the Space Station when it becomes too dirty to wear because there is no way to clean it. Food nutritional content and quality decreases over time and depends on the specific nutrients, food matrix, food packaging, and storage environment. Food may need to be stored up to five years before consumption, and maintaining stable nutrition is a significant challenge. Reductions in food mass, nutrient studies, and nutrient generation are not requested as part of this subtopic. All proposals should consider maintainability as well as dormancy periods without crew. Vehicle Level Cold/Alternate Atmosphere Food Storage Innovative use of materials, insulation, and heat removal systems are requested. Standalone systems as well as innovative approaches integrated into portions of the vehicle structure and thermal loops are acceptable. One method of increasing food nutrient shelf-life is with cold stowage and/or alternate atmospheres (i.e., low oxygen composition). Stored food volumes of 2-8 m3, with average packaged food density of 250-500 kg/m3, may be required at temperature ranges of -80° to +20°C. Oxygen levels <21% and food compartment pressures less than one atmosphere are being studied for their effects. Ability to control the atmosphere and pressure in the cold stowage volume is beneficial but is not required of a submitted technology, nor is the full temperature range listed above required. Systems must be capable of surviving launch loads (6g axial and 2g lateral) when fully loaded and be capable of autonomous operation for up to five years in microgravity. Concepts must be volumetrically efficient, mass efficient, and highly reliable since loss of food quality can result in loss of crew performance. The advantages of proposed concepts compared to the ISS Refrigerator/Freezer Rack (RFR) and terrestrial high efficiency freezers must be described. The ISS RFR, which never flew but achieved temperatures of -22°C and +4°C in freezer and refrigerator modes, had a secondary mass penalty of 1.36 kg for every 1 kg of food due to cabinet, drawers, insulation, cooling system and rack masses. (NASA/TP-2015–218570) The goal is to lower this secondary mass penalty for cold stowage below 0.2 kg per 1 kg of food. For long term storage of food, drawers are not required. At the same time, the refrigeration and insulation systems should be efficient enough to run (at steady state) on less than 0.15 Watts per kg of food frozen at -22°C in a 23°C ambient. Alternative Launch Packaging of Logistics and Cargo Alternatives to the existing ISS use of Cargo Transfer Bags (CTBs), foam, straps, and cargo pallets is required. Cargo densities of 510 kg/m3 (single CTB capability) must be supported during launch acceleration of 6g axial and 2g lateral. Total packaging mass efficiencies of all required materials between the cargo and the vehicle pressure shell structure should be less than 0.3 kg packaging/kg of cargo. Concepts should be capable of scaling between logistics vehicles with diameters of 3-8 meters and lengths of 4-10 meters. Logistics vehicle atmospheric pressure may vary from 0-1 atm for launch and 0.5-1 atm during crew use. Innovative Crew Clothing Systems to Extend Duration of Wear Innovative systems that refresh crew clothing to extend the duration of wear are requested. Crew exercise clothing, for example, is currently discarded into the trash after 2-3 uses because there are no space laundry systems. The goal is to extend the duration of wear by 2-3 times or more for several types of garments. Systems must be capable of sanitizing/refreshing a small set of crew clothing that includes exercise t-shirts, exercise socks, exercise shorts, male and female undergarments, and male and female daily wear, such as crew polo shirts. The system should provide odor control while preserving the appearance, color and brightness, and the physical and mechanical properties of the fabrics, which include cotton, wool and modacrylic. Odor control can be through absorption, adsorption, denaturation, or neutralization of pH and odorous compounds, etc. Innovative use of technologies, such as ultraviolet light, microwaves, vacuum, ozone, steam, CO2, charcoal filtration, minimal water, or other technologies will be considered. The crew clothing sanitizing/refreshing system must be capable of operating for a minimum of 3 years in microgravity with minimal consumables, crew time requirement and electrical power. Cleaning/washing agent should be limited to less than 10 grams of consumables per kg of crew clothing for each refresh. No water or extremely low water usage systems are preferred, but if water is used, water usage should be less than 200 grams per kg of clothing washed. No hazardous gases or particles can be released into the crew atmosphere during or after operation. Concepts must be volumetrically efficient, mass efficient, not adversely impact the closed loop life support systems, and be highly reliable. Cleaning/washing systems may be used during outbound transit to Mars, then be dormant for up to 18 months prior to the return trip to Earth. Controlling microbial activity and odor during this dormancy is important to habitat and crew health.

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,H4.01Damage Tolerant Lightweight Pressure Structures, JSC," ARC, LaRC"," TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems", 2017,"Damage to and the resultant leakage of the suit structure is a criticality 1 failure that could result in loss of mission or life. NASA is striving to build a robust suit structure that can withstand the wear and tear related to exploration of a planetary surface. A highly mobile exploration spacesuit must have lightweight and robust hard upper torso. Hard upper torsos are used on the current Extravehicular Mobility Unit systems and desirable for the future because they are robust structures that require little maintenance, they provide simple and robust interfaces with the portable life support system, and they create a consistent and well sized structure for the mobility joints. On recent development of the Z-2 space suit, NASA evaluated the use of carbon fibers, fiberglass, and kevlar composite structures to push the state of the art for a complex geometry, lightweight, and damage tolerant hard upper torso structure. Development included evaluation of various lay-ups, material combinations, and polymer systems. The end product was a hybrid composite structure of carbon and fiber glass composite. The hybrid structure was able to withstand impact energies around 100J. NASA is interested in developing an innovative, new structure that is even more robust to impact and can maintain a low leakage level or re-seal the pressure structure after impact or damage. Hybrid laminates, materials, and construction methods should be considered to optimize toughness and damage tolerance (strength and durability). Special consideration should be given to select materials and configurations which lend themselves to manufacturability to complex shapes and repair-ability. NASA has also investigated the use of thin films on pressure vessels to make a composite structure more robust to damage and leakage. Mechanical strength of the selected materials should be characterized in both the “pristine” and “damaged” (after impact) condition, including Tension, Compression, and Interlaminar shear. Performance targets: No leakage after Low Velocity Impact (LVI) of 300J of energy using ASTM D-7136 impact test with 2"" diameter steel impactor and impact velocities of less than 15 ft/s. Structure density of less than 1.7 g/cm3. Primary structure and sample thickness of 0.125"" or less.

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,"H4.02Small, Accurate Oxygen Compatible Gas Flow Meter for Suit Operations", JSC," ARC, LaRC"," TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems", 2017,"The current state of the art for flow measurement on the current ISS Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) space suit is a flapper valve tied to a microswitch. The current EMU flapper valve technology only supports microgravity EVAs (single flow rate requirement) with a sufficient versus non-sufficient flow measurement capability. With the multi-mission goals of the advanced space suit, variable flow rates are required. Therefore, the goals for the required flow meter include accurate measurement of 2-8 acfm ± 1% with a pressure drop requirement of less than 0.68 in-H20 in a pure oxygen (O2) environment. This flow meter needs to also fit within a volume/shape factor of approximately 2.5 in x 1.5in x 3in or less. An innovation is required since currently available flow meters do not meet these specifications. The Portable Life Support System (PLSS) capable of supporting planned exploration missions is capable of adapting between varied Space Suit Assembly (SSA) architectures that are optimized for micro-gravity Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs) from vehicles such as the International Space Station (ISS) to rear-entry walking suits suitable for operation on the lunar and Martian surfaces. The varied suit designs and associated crewmember exertion within the suits under micro-gravity to partial gravity require the ability to vary the suit ventilation flow rate and also to vary the monitoring/alarming for the selected ventilation flow rates. This limits the application of existing flapper-microswitch style low pressure drop flow switches and requires application of technologies such as flow/pressure drop measurements or thermal mass flow measurements. One of the most constraining requirements is the low permissible pressure drop as the flow measurement has been integrated as a measured pressure drop across the ventilation loop heat exchanger 0.68 +/- 0.07 in-H2O with ventilation gas flow at 6 acfm (170 lpm) and suit pressure of 4.3 psia and 60°F and 100% O2 (traces of NH3, H2O, CO2); the allocation of differential pressure (DP) will be ~0.5 in-H2O should the measurement not be acquired across an existing pressure drop in the system. Evaluation of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) DP sensors has yielded units that are either too large or orientation/vibration sensitive as this hardware needs to operate and tolerate up to 2 grms Grms vibration during operation and >9 grms Grms while stowed. Volume/shape factor is approximately 2.5 in x 1.5 in x 3 in or less including fluid ports and electrical connectors; if added as an in-line flow, 1 in inlet/outlet porting will be necessary. The absolute pressure range with 100% oxygen is up to 25 psia; the optimal choices would include materials not considered flammable in this environment to reduce compatibility issues with things such as kindling chain ignitions of human generated debris. A thermal mass flow measurement would also seek to minimize the energy input and operating temperature above the core stream temperature to further improve oxygen compatibility. The measurement range for the sensor is 2-8 acfm +/- 1% with 100% O2, suit pressure from 3.5-25 psia, temperature from 50-90°F, RH 0-50%, and CO2 from 0-15mmHg. The sensor must also tolerate low dose rate to 30 krad as well as high energy particles to 75 MeV-cm2/mg without destructive Single Event Effects (SEE) such as latchup, gate rupture, burnout, etc. The ambient operating environment will range from sea level conditions to vacuum with ambient thermal sink ~50°F. Operating life will need to be 8 years without calibration and 5000 hrs of powered operation. Read less>>"
Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,H4.03Sensors to Measure Space Suit Interactions with the Human Body, JSC, JSC," TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems", 2017,"Space suits can be tested unmanned for range of motion and joint torque in an attempt to quantify and compare space suit joint designs and overall suit architecture. However, this data is irrelevant if humans using the suits aren't effective. Characterizing human suited performance has continued to be a challenge, partly due to limitations in sensor technology. One concept is to use sensors placed at/on the human body, underneath the pressure garment to obtain knowledge of the human bodies movements. This data could then be compared against the suit motion. Various sensors, sensor technologies, and sensor implementations have been attempted over two decades of efforts, but each has had issues. Previous efforts have used Force Sensitive Resistors (FSR), TouchSense shear sensors, pressure-sensing arrays (Tek scan etc.), piezo-electric sensors, among others but have not met all requirements. Most issues have centered around accuracy when placed on the pliant surface of the skin, and accuracy when placed over curved surfaces of the skin. Accuracy has been sufficient to delineate low, medium or high levels of force but not a reliable quantitative value. This, combined with aberrant readings when the sensor is bent has led to these sensors only providing a rough idea of the interaction between the suit and the skin: while in a controlled environment the sensors are accurate to within 10% or so, the accuracy falls significantly when measuring the skin and being bent or pressed in inconsistent ways; on the order of 50% accuracy or worse. The sensors also are prone to drift (falling out of calibration) quickly during use. Lastly, the sensors, while pliant, are still relatively thick and as such translates to discomfort and loss of tactility. This is typical during all previous testing but most notable when sensors are bent along an axis (or worse, along two axis such as required to follow a complex anatomical contour). As such, the effect on the suit/skin interface that is being measured is changed, which adds an additional complication to interpreting data output from these sensors. Much of the work within JSC has improved the integration, comfort, and calibration of these sensors, but the accuracy performance characteristics when in use have not been sufficient to meet requirements. A new sensor technology is warranted for use in our application. Current critical needs that this technology would enable include the ability to optimize suit design for ergonomics, comfort and fit without the sole reliance on subjective feedback. While subjective feedback is important, developing a method to quantify the amount of force or pressure on a particular anatomical or suit landmark will aid in providing a richer definition of the suit/human interface that can be leveraged to make space suits more comfortable while reducing risk of injury. Taken together, these improvements will enhance EVA performance, reduce overhead and reduce personnel and programmatic risk. This technology implementation would require relatively accurate pressure or force readings in the medium to high range. In the future, alternative space suit architectures such as mechanical counter pressure may be feasible, and a critical ancillary to such an architecture is to verify that necessary physiological pressure requirements are being met to ensure the health and safety of the crew. To this end, the technology should be able to accurately measure mechanical pressure on the human skin in the low pressure (< 10 psi) range. Performance targets vary upon application, but the sensing technology should have the following characteristics: Measures force and/or mechanical pressure. Accurate to within 10%. Resistant to aberrant readings when under moderate bending, shear or torsion. Either sufficiently pliant, or high enough spatial resolution, to follow anatomical curves on the human skin without discomfort or lack of mobility. Thin profile (~mm). Packaged at high spatial resolution (~cm) or sufficiently small to facilitate a custom packaging/substrate solution with a high spatial resolution. Free of rigid or sharp points that would cause discomfort. Low power (~5V, ~mA). Capable of integration to the inside of the pressurized suit surface as well as the human skin (or integrated to conformal garment). At this early stage, a simple digital readout capability to evaluate sensor performance. For this SBIR opportunity specifically, we are looking for a single sensor technology that targets the above requirements including readout capability. They should either be packaged into a component level prototype (shoulder or arm segment with multiple sensors) or a flexible packaging option (multiple sensors that could be integrated ad-hoc into a component level prototype through placement of said sensors on the skin or comfort garment). The most attention should be paid to maximizing spatial resolution, accuracy and thinness for this prototype. Lastly, as previous work has demonstrated a relatively high failure rate of these sensor types over time, the individual sensor elements should be replaceable and/or spares should be provided.

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,H6.01Integrated System Health Management for Sustainable Habitats, ARC," JSC, MSFC"," TA11 Modeling, Simulation, Information Technology and Processing", 2017,"Habitation systems provide a safe place for astronauts to live and work in space and on planetary surfaces. They enable crews to live and work safely in deep space, and include integrated life support systems, radiation protection, fire safety, and systems to reduce logistics and the need for resupply missions. Innovative health management technologies are needed in order to increase the safety and mission-effectiveness for future space habitats on other planets, asteroids, or lunar surfaces. For example, off-nominal or failure conditions occurring in safety-critical life support systems may need to be addressed quickly by the habitat crew without extensive technical support from Earth due to communication delays. If the crew in the habitat must manage, plan and operate much of the mission themselves, operations support must be migrated from Earth to the habitat. Enabling monitoring, tracking, and management capabilities on-board the habitat and related EVA platforms for a small crew to use will require significant automation and decision support software. This subtopic seeks to broaden the scope of traditional caution and warning systems, which are typically triggered by out-of-bounds sensor values, by including machine learning and data mining techniques. These methods aim to reveal latent, unknown conditions while still retaining and improving the ability to provide highly accurate alerts for known issues. The performance targets for known faults and failures will be based upon false alarm rate, missed detection rate, and detection time (first time prior to the adverse event that the algorithm indicates an impending fault/failure). Methods should explore the trade space for ISHM data and processing needs in order to provide guidance for future habitat sensor and computational resource requirements. Proposals may address specific system health management capabilities required for habitat system elements (life support systems, etc.). In addition, projects may focus on one or more relevant subsystems such as water recycling systems, photovoltaic systems, electrical power systems, and environmental monitoring systems. Proposals that involve the use of existing testbeds or facilities at one of the participating NASA centers (e.g., Sustainability Base at ARC) for technology validation, verification, and maturation are strongly encouraged. Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) of 4 to 6 or higher are sought. Key features of Sustainability Base that make it relevant to deep space habitat technology are its use of a grey water recycling system and a photo-voltaic array. Data logged from other facility management/building automation systems include environmental data (temp, CO2, etc.) and facility equipment sensors (flowrates, differential pressures, temperatures, etc.). Also, information on power consumption (whole building, plug load, other loads metered at the panel/circuit level) can be made available. These remaining systems, while conventionally ""green,"" have no unique feature that can't be exclusively used for terrestrial purposes. However, the fact that all such systems require less power to support human occupancy can be used as a focal point to serve as a testbed for deep space habitats that will need to operate within finite energy budgets. Specific technical areas of interest related to integrated systems health management include the following: Machine learning and data mining techniques that are capable of learning from operations data to identify statistical anomalies that may represent previously unknown system degradations. Methods should facilitate the incorporation of human feedback on the operational significance of the statistical anomalies using techniques such as active learning. Demonstration of advanced predictive capability using machine learning or data mining methods for known system fault or failure modes, within prescribed performance constraints related to detection time and accuracy. Prognostic techniques able to predict system degradation, leading to system robustness through automated fault mitigation and improved operational effectiveness. Proposals in this area should focus on systems and components commonly found in space habitats or EVA platforms. Innovative human-system integration methods that can convey a wealth of health and status information to mission support staff quickly and effectively, especially under off-nominal and emergency conditions. Proposals that address lower TRL research on the foundational principles of sustainable technologies and systems involving academic partnerships should consider responding to STTR subtopic T6.01 - Closed-Loop Living System for Deep Space ECLSS with Immediate Applications for Sustainable Planet.

Focus Area 7 Human Research and Health Maintenance,H12.01Radioprotectors and Mitigators of Space Radiation-induced Health Risks, LaRC, JSC," TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems", 2017,"Space radiation is a significant obstacle to sending humans on long duration missions beyond low earth orbit. NASA is concerned with the health risks to astronauts following exposures to galactic cosmic rays (GCR), the high energy particles found outside Earth’s atmosphere. Astronaut health risks from GCR are categorized into cancer, late and early central nervous systems (CNS) effects, and degenerative risks, which includes cardiovascular diseases and cataracts (see references below for more detail). This subtopic is for biological countermeasures to minimize or prevent adverse health effects from space radiation: chronic, low dose, low dose-rate, mixed field (high LET and low LET) and mission relevant doses (0.25 to 0.5 Gy). Radioprotectors or mitigators are needed that can target common pathways (e.g., inflammation) across cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration. This subtopic will consider: FDA approved drugs. FDA Off-label usage drugs. FDA IND Status drugs. Dietary supplements. Biological countermeasures under development for acute radiation syndrome or prevention of secondary radiation-induced diseases from radiation therapy may be ideal for this topic and allow the company to expand its product line to space radiation, carbon ion therapy and ground based late effects from nuclear fallout. The biological countermeasure criteria: Medical products and regimens that prevent and/or mitigate adverse health effects due to space radiation with emphasis on broad activity (i.e., multi-tissue) Mechanism of action well known Independent of sex Capable of being delivered chronically for the period of the mission (potentially up to 3 years) Easily administered; capable of self-administration (e.g., Oral, inhaled) Known/potential benefits greater than known potential risks; minimal adverse events No contraindications with other drugs used for treating other symptoms or diseases during the mission Long shelf-life Phase I will test radioprotectors or mitigators using mixed radiation fields that must include a low LET source such as gamma combined with high LET radiation such as neutrons or alpha particles to determine efficacy in mixed fields at space relevant doses. This testing can be done at the location of choice. Companies should provide a test plan that will demonstrate the compound being proposed provides protection or mitigation of radiation-induced injury for normal tissues and does not protect cancer cells. A kickoff meeting with NASA is mandatory prior to the start of this award. Phase II will test effective radioprotectors or mitigators in space radiation simulated environments (HZE) to determine if they are able to minimize or prevent late effects directly related to the development of cancer, neurodegeneration or cardiovascular disease. Companies should provide a test plan for in vivo evaluation that describes the expected effect from the compound.

Focus Area 7 Human Research and Health Maintenance,H12.02Advanced Model-based Adaptive Interfaces and Augmented Reality, JSC," ARC, JPL, KSC, MSFC"," TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems", 2017,"NASA is seeking innovative solutions for the design of adaptive interfaces for complex information systems that will be used on autonomous missions by crewmembers in various states of workload, stress, and fatigue. Adaptive user interfaces, also called intelligent user interfaces, can decrease workload in cases of high attentional loads by presenting the information needed in simpler forms or in different formats. For example, to decrease attentional load, the interface may be modified from text to icons, or the interaction may change from written procedures to voice commands. There is evidence that workload can be reduced if some of the visual information is presented in a different modality or format in high attentional demand situations. Adaptive user interfaces can also provide displays that offer improved and optimized navigation tailored for the current state of the user. Interfaces can be augmented with visual and auditory elements that, again, adapt based on the needs of the user. Thus, the adaptability of the interface is increased in a different dimension. The augmented reality (AR) technology holds the promise to improve crew performance to execute complex procedures in a deep-space human spaceflight missions where communication back to the Earth-based mission control is limited and delayed. In Phase I, a proof-of-concept prototype for an adaptive interface system with augmented reality should be developed and tested for a high workload (e.g., fault management or critical time constraints) scenario. The work should include a literature review on the effects of modality (visual, auditory, tactile, and combination of these) and format (e. g., text, icons, graphs) on workload. A model should be developed based on these principles, as well as an adaptive interface framework for a selected system used for spaceflight. Example scenarios and displays will be provided by NASA for this purpose. Model inputs can be simulated or emulated with hardware. The key technology areas are image registration, new software approaches to integrate augmented reality content from multimedia and multiple modalities, fusion of vision, human tracking, and integration of digital data with live sensor data and models. In Phase II, the prototype adaptive interface system with augmented reality should be designed and validated for the selected high workload use case, as well as a procedure-based task. Display components should dynamically change as a function of the cognitive state and the level of expertise of the operator. The cognitive states (stress, fatigue, and workload) do not need to be measured or prototype; they can be simulated with various levels and treated as input parameters to the prototype. The usability of the prototype should be tested, including trigger events and timing of adaptation. The team should include expertise on augmented reality, interface design, task analysis, and workload. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II system/software demonstration and delivering a demonstration system/software package including source code for NASA testing. This technology will support NASA's Human Spaceflight Architecture Team List of Critical Technologies, including HAT 4.7.a-E Crew Autonomy Beyond LEO (systems and tools to provide the crew with independence from Earth-based ground support) and HAT 6.3.e-E Deep Space Mission Human Factors and Habitability (human factors technology in design).

State of the art (SOA) technologies for these ISRU processes either do not exist, are too small of scale, or are too complex, heavy, inefficient, or consume too much power. Proposals must consider and address operating life issues for Mars surface applications that can last for up to 480 days of continuous (day/night) operation. All proposals need to identify the State of the Art of applicable technologies and processes. Hardware to be delivered at the conclusion of Phase II will be required to operate under Mars surface pressure, atmosphere constituent, and temperature conditions. Therefore, thermal management during operation of the proposed technology will also need to be specified in the Phase I proposal. Requirements and specifications for Mars surface conditions and soil properties can be found in the ISRU Topic Description. Phase I proposals for innovative technologies and processes must include the design and test of critical attributes or high risk areas associated with the proposed technology or process. Proposals will be evaluated on mass, power, complexity, and the ability to achieve hardware specifications below. Technologies are sought for collection and compression of Mars atmosphere gases for subsequent processing into oxygen and possibly fuel. Based on redundancy and production margin assumptions (40% of total production rate), carbon dioxide in the Mars atmosphere must be acquired and compressed to a minimum of 103.4 KPa (15 psi) pressure and up to a desired 517.1 KPa (75 psi) at a rate of 0.6 kg/hr for oxygen and fuel production and 2.7 kg/hr for oxygen production alone. Multiple units are allowed, but should be justified based on overall mass, power, thermal, and/or operation duration requirements. Understanding the change in mass, power, volume, and complexity as a function of outlet pressure is also an important factor in selection. Since carbon dioxide is the main gas of interest, techniques and technologies that separate the carbon dioxide from the other gases in the Mars atmosphere before, during, or after compression are considered beneficial in the selection process. Proposers should consider but not be limited to past work on Mars atmosphere collection, separation, and compression technologies such as carbon dioxide freezing, rapid cycle adsorption pumps, and mechanical compressors. For concepts that separate carbon dioxide from other Mars gases at Mars atmosphere pressures, proposers must include an active flow device to ensure the remaining gases do not prevent further separation and collection of the carbon dioxide. Proposals should consider the impact on atmosphere flow to overcome flow resistance due to filtration devices that will need to be placed at the inlet. Power needed for the proposed technology operation should be differentiated between electrical and thermal, and consideration should be given on how the thermal management system and the Mars environment could minimize the need for electrical-to-thermal energy conversion. Since downstream carbon dioxide processing technologies are performed at a minimum of 400°C, cooling of the compressed gas to below this temperature is not required for downstream operations. Technologies are sought for separation of nitrogen and argon from the Mars atmosphere during or after Mars carbon dioxide separation and compression. Mars atmosphere gas flow rates, pressures, and temperatures are as specified above for Mars atmosphere/carbon dioxide compression. Power needed for the proposed technology operation should be differentiated between electrical and thermal, and consideration should be given on how the thermal management system and the Mars environment could minimize the need for electrical-to-thermal energy conversion. All proposals need to identify the State of the Art of applicable technologies and processes. At this time, it is not known whether the nitrogen and argon will be stored as a pressurized gas or a cryogenic liquid, so it should be noted which storage option is more beneficial for the proposed technology.

Focus Area 8 In-Situ Resource Utilization,H1.02Mars Soil Acquisition and Processing for In Situ Water, JSC," ARC, GRC, JPL, KSC, LaRC, MSFC", TA7 Human Exploration Destination Systems, 2017,"Innovative technologies and approaches are sought related to ISRU processes associated with excavating and processing soils on Mars to remove, collect, and clean in-situ water for subsequent use in oxygen and fuel production or delivery to the habitat for life support and radiation shielding usage. Proposals must consider and address operating life issues for Mars surface applications that can last for up to 480 days of continuous (day/night) operation. All proposals need to identify the State of the Art of applicable technologies and processes. Hardware to be delivered at the conclusion of Phase II will be required to operate under Mars surface pressure, atmosphere constituent, and temperature conditions.

Phase I proposals for innovative technologies and processes must include the design and test of critical attributes or high risk areas associated with the proposed technology or process. Proposals will be evaluated on mass, power, complexity, and the ability to achieve hardware specifications below. Technologies are sought for excavation and transfer of hydrated and icy Mars soils. For hydrated soils, the excavated soil can be delivered to a centralized soil processing plant or processed on the excavation rover itself. The amount of water content in the hydrated Mars soil can vary from as low as between 1.5 and 2% on the surface at almost all locations on Mars to above 10% depending on the location and mineral. The concentration of water may also increase below a desiccated layer of soil at the surface, so technologies for excavation and transfer need to consider soil properties and water content as a function of depth and minerals and should be applicable to a range of landing sites where icy soils do not exist. The need to excavate down to at least 0.5 meters should be considered. The amount of water content in icy Mars soil can vary greatly as a function of depth and latitude. Based on analysis of Mars orbital data, proposers should assume a minimum of 10% by weight of water/ice up to 90%. Due to human landing and ascent considerations, Mars water based resources should be constrained between +/1 50 deg. latitude. Based on the potential high water content by mass in icy soils, it is expected that icy soil excavated will be either processed in-situ or on the excavation rover itself. Proposers should also assume that up to 0.5 m of soil may exist above icy soils and that excavation down to at least 1 meter is required. Proposers should note the impact on concept mass, power, and complexity for excavation down to 3 meters. Proposals should consider water loss due to hardware temperature, material agitation, and duration of soil exposure to the environment before transfer to soil processing systems. Note requirements for the mobility platform associated with hydrated soil excavation and transfer will be included in the H8 Robotic Systems Topic. Technologies are sought for processing of hydrated and icy Mars soils to extract water. Soil processing for water extraction needs to consider the range of water content in Mars soils and water extraction rates defined below. Proposals for soil processing also need to define potential water loss due to valve/enclosure sealing for closed soil reactors or losses due to exposure to the surrounding environment or soil for open soil reactors. Proposals need to consider what other volatiles and contaminants are released due to soil processing/heating. Proposed solutions that perform in a non-continuous fashion are acceptable, as long as they achieve the same total production quantities on a daily or weekly basis. Understanding the change in mass, power, volume, complexity, and contaminant release as a function of water content in the soil, heating temperature, and heating method are important factors in selection. Power needed for the proposed technology operation should be differentiated between electrical and thermal, and consideration should be given on how the thermal management system and the Mars environment could minimize the need for electrical-to-thermal energy conversion. Based on past and recent human Mars exploration mission studies, to meet ascent propellant production rates with margin, approximately 1.6 kg/hr of water must be collected and cleaned for subsequent processing. At this time, 3 soil processing units for extraction of water from Mars soils is baselined for human Mars missions. Multiple excavation and processing units are allowed, but should be justified based on overall mass, power, thermal, and/or operation duration requirements. Proposers can submit combined excavation and soil processing technologies. Technologies are sought for the separation, collection, and cleaning of water released from soil processing of hydrated and icy Mars soils. Separation of contaminants from water can be performed in the vapor phase during release or after collection, but technologies need to be regenerative. Separate and multiple technologies for collection, separation, and cleanup can be proposed for any one or all of the functions (separation, collection, and cleaning) All must operate in conjunction with the soil processing reactors for the soil/water production rates, contaminants, and mission durations specified above. It is encouraged that proposers for soil processing of Mars soils also consider including technologies requested below for water separation, collection, and cleanup since the two technology needs can be highly interconnected. Multiple units are allowed, but should be justified based on overall mass, power, thermal, and/or operation duration requirements. Water will need to be clean enough to be fed to a proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis unit. Proposals for ISRU hardware for Mars material excavation, transfer, and processing for the extraction of water need to consider physical, mineral, and volatile characteristics and variations for hydrated and icy soils, as well as the types of volatiles and contaminants released during heating. Information on potential Mars water-based resources and mineral properties can be found in the recent Mars Water In-Situ resources Utilizations (ISRU) Planning (M-WIP) Study posted at https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/reports/Mars_Water_ISRU_Study.pdf, and information on what volatiles and contaminants are released due to soil processing/heating can be found in “Volatile, Isotope, and Organic Analysis of Martian Fines with the Mars Curiosity Rover” by Leshin et al., For example, besides water, varying amounts of CH3CI, HCN, SO2, HCI, and H2S were released as a function of temperature. Further research and evaluation of mineral properties, constituents, and potential contaminants based on different hydrated and icy soil minerals is highly recommended and should be addressed in proposals.

Focus Area 8 In-Situ Resource Utilization,H2.01Lunar Resources, KSC," ARC, GRC, GSFC, JPL, JSC, LaRC, MSFC", TA7 Human Exploration Destination Systems, 2017,"Whereas the Moon was once thought to be dry, more recent discoveries indicate that there are a variety of resources that exist on the Moon in an embedded or frozen state in the regolith. When acquired and exposed to higher temperatures and vacuum, these resources will change state into the vapor phase and are known as volatiles. Examples of this are polar water ice or hydrogen and helium 3 embedded in the regolith grains by the sun. Lunar volatiles are a meaningful first focus area for a space exploration strategy because: Use of local space resources, including lunar volatiles, for propellant, life support, etc. will improve the sustainability of human space exploration. Technologies and methods for accessing lunar volatiles are relevant to potential future Mars resource utilization. An ancillary benefit is that the volatiles are of great interest to the science community and provide clues to help understand the solar wind, comets, and the history of the inner solar system. Recent data from NASA's Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS), and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) missions indicate that as much as 20% of the material kicked up by the LCROSS impact was volatiles, including water, methane, ammonia, hydrogen gas, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. The instruments also discovered relatively large amounts of light metals such as sodium, mercury and possibly even silver. Small payloads up to 2 kg in mass are needed to characterize and map the lunar volatiles resources so that they can be included in a future lunar ISRU strategy. This payload may be delivered to the Moon on a small commercial lunar lander and could be stationary on the lander, mobile on a mobility device, or it may itself be mobile and/or deployable. Impactors and other devices that are used or released in lunar orbit are not within the scope of this solicitation. The entire surface of the Moon is covered with fragmental and unconsolidated crushed rock material known as regolith, which was formed over billions of years of high-energy impacts by meteorites, comets and other solar system debris. Estimates are that this regolith covers the top 8-10 meters of the Moon’s surface. Regolith represents a significant resource due to the bound oxygen that is present in some minerals; metals such as aluminum, iron and magnesium that can be extracted to make parts; and its use as a bulk construction aggregate material for civil engineering structures or radiation shielding. In addition other engineering parameters such as trafficability must be known before effective exploration can take place. Silicate minerals, composed dominantly of silicon and oxygen, are the most abundant constituents, making up over 90% by volume of most lunar rocks. The most common silicate minerals are pyroxene, (Ca,Fe,Mg)2Si2O6; plagioclase feldspar, (Ca,Na)(Al,Si)408; and olivine, (Mg,Fe)2SiO4. Oxide minerals, composed chiefly of metals and oxygen, are next in abundance after silicate minerals. They are particularly concentrated in the mare basalts, and they may make up as much as 20% by volume of these rocks. The most abundant oxide mineral is ilmenite, (Fe,Mg)TiO3, a black, opaque mineral that reflects the high TiO2 contents of many mare basalts. The second most abundant oxide mineral, spinel, has a widely varying composition and actually consists of a complex series of solid solutions. Members of this series include: chromite, FeCr2O4; ulvöspinel, Fe2TiO4; hercynite, FeAl2O4; and spinel (sensu stricto), MgAl2O4. Another oxide phase, which is only abundant in titanium-rich lunar basalts, is armalcolite, (Fe,Mg)Ti2O5. Small payloads up to 2 kg in mass are needed to characterize and map the mineral resources so that they can be included in a future lunar ISRU strategy. This payload may be delivered to the Moon on a small commercial lunar lander and could be stationary on the lander, mobile on a mobility device, or it may itself be mobile and/or deployable.

I-D-7 Subsection g: Concentration of water and other volatiles species with depth 1-2 m scales Polar cold traps are likely less than ~2 Ga, so only the upper 2-3 m of regolith are likely to be volatile-rich. I-D-9 Subsection I: mineralogical, elemental, molecular, isotopic make up of volatiles Water and other exotic volatile species are present; must know species and concentrations. I-D-10 Subsection j: Physical nature of volatile species (e.g., pure concentrations, inter-granular, globular) Range of occurrences of volatiles; pure deposits (radar), mixtures of ice/dirt (LCROSS), H2-rich soils (neutron).

III-G Test radiation shielding technologies Protecting human crews beyond the magnetic fields of the Earth from space radiation is a critical. In addition to Earth-based testing, could be further accomplished during lunar robotic missions. All proposals need to identify the state-of-the-art of applicable technologies and processes. Hardware to be delivered at the conclusion of Phase II will be required to operate under lunar equivalent vacuum and temperature conditions, so thermal management during operation of the proposed technology will need to be specified in the Phase I proposal. Phase I proposals for innovative technologies and processes must include the design and test of critical attributes or high risk areas associated with the proposed payload technology or process to achieve the objectives of the Phase II delivered payload hardware. Proposals will be evaluated on mass, power, volume, and complexity. At the end of Phase II, the payload hardware should be capable of being ready to be flown in space within one year, with additional testing taking place during that year. Read less>>"
"Focus Area 9 Sensors, Detectors and Instruments",S1.01Lidar Remote Sensing Technologies, GSFC," JPL, LaRC"," TA8 Science Instruments, Observatories & Sensor Systems", 2017,"NASA recognizes the potential of lidar technology in meeting many of its science objectives by providing new capabilities or offering enhancements over current measurements of atmospheric and topographic parameters from ground, airborne, and space-based platforms. To meet NASA’s requirements for remote sensing from space, advances are needed in state-of-the-art lidar technology with an emphasis on compactness, efficiency, reliability, lifetime, and high performance. Innovative lidar subsystem and component technologies that directly address the measurement of atmospheric constituents and surface topography of the Earth, Mars, the Moon, and other planetary bodies will be considered under this subtopic. Compact, high-efficiency lidar instruments for deployment on unconventional platforms, such as balloon, small sat, and CubeSat are also considered and encouraged. Proposals must show relevance to the development of lidar instruments that can be used for NASA science-focused measurements or to support current technology programs. Meeting science needs leads to four primary instrument types: Backscatter - Measures beam reflection from aerosols to retrieve the opacity of a gas. Ranging - Measures the return beam’s time-of-flight to retrieve distance. Doppler - Measures wavelength changes in the return beam to retrieve relative velocity. Differential Absorption - Measures attenuation of two different return beams (one centered on a spectral line of interest) to retrieve concentration of a trace gas. Phase I research should demonstrate technical feasibility and show a path toward a Phase II prototype unit. Phase II prototypes should be capable of laboratory demonstration and preferably suitable for operation in the field from a ground-based station, an aircraft platform, or any science platform amply defended by the proposer. For the 2017 SBIR Program, NASA is soliciting the component and subsystem technologies described below: Compact and rugged single-frequency continuous-wave and pulsed lasers operating between 290 nm and 2.05 micrometer wavelengths suitable for Lidar. Specific wavelengths of interest to match absorption lines or atmospheric transmission: 0.29 – 0.32 micrometer (ozone absorption), 0.45 – 0.049 micrometer (ocean sensing), 0.532 micrometer, 0.815 micrometer (water line), 1.0 micrometer, 1.57 micrometer (CO2 line), 1.65 micrometer (methane line), and 2.05 micrometer (CO2 line). Architectures involving new developments in diode laser, quantum cascade laser, and fiber laser technology are especially encouraged. For pulsed lasers two different regimes of repetition rate and pulse energies are desired: from 1 kHz to 10 kHz with pulse energy greater than 1 mJ and from 20 Hz to 100 Hz with pulse energy greater than 100 mJ. Optical amplifiers for increasing the energy of pulsed lasers in the wavelength range of 0.28 micrometer to 2.05 micrometer. Specific wavelengths of interest are listed in the above bullet. Also, amplifier and modulator combinations for converting continuous-wave lasers to a pulsed format are encouraged. Amplifier designs must preserve the wavelength stability and spectral purity of the input laser. Ultra-low noise photoreceiver modules, operating at 1.6 micrometer wavelength, consisting of the detection device, complete Dewar/cooling systems, and associated amplifiers. General requirements are: large single-element active detection diameter (>200 micrometer), high quantum efficiency (>85%), noise equivalent power of the order of 10-14 W/sqrt(Hz), and bandwidth greater than 10 MHz. Novel, highly efficient approaches for High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) receivers. New approaches for high-efficiency measurement of HSRL aerosol properties at 1064, 532 and/or 355 nm. New or improved approaches are sought that substantially increase detection efficiency over current state of the art. Ideally, complete receiver subsystems will be proposed that can be evaluated and/or implemented in instrument concept designs. New space lidar technologies that use small and high-efficiency diode or fiber lasers to measure range and surface reflectance of asteroids and comets from >100 km altitude during mapping to <1 m during landing and sample return with a size, weight, and power substantially less than 28x28x26 cm3, 7.4 kg, and 17 W respectively. Technologies that can significantly extend the receiver dynamic range of the current space lidar without movable attenuators, providing sufficient link margin for the longest range but not saturating during landing. The output power of the laser transmitters should be continuously adjusted according to the spacecraft altitude. The receiver should have single photon sensitivity to achieve a near-quantum limited performance for long distance measurement. The receiver integration time can be continuously adjusted to allow trade-off between the maximum range and measurement rate. The lidar should have multiple beams so that it can measure not only the range but also surface slope and orientation. Fast laser beam steering mechanism to increase the sampling density, coverage, and signal to noise ratio of pulsed space-based Lidar. The mechanism needs to steer a 1064 nm pulsed laser beam through a set of at least 8 discrete and repeatable angles spanning a range of 10 mrad or greater along one dimension. The scan repetition rate needs to be 8 kHz or higher. Desired specifications include a pointing accuracy of 0.1 mrad or better, a settling time of <15 microseconds to switch between two angles apart, and a usable aperture of 10 mm (can be achieved using a beam expander as long as the outgoing beam meets all requirements).

High electronic gain (10E4 to 10E6), low noise, fast time response (<10 ns), minimal dead time (<5% dead time at 10 ns response time), high segmentation with low dead area (<20% nominal, <5% goal), and the ability to tailor pixel size to match that dictated by the imaging optics. Optical designs under consideration dictate a pixel size ranging from approximately 2 x 2 mm2 to 10 x 10 mm2. Focal plane mass must be minimized (2g/cm2 goal). Individual pixel readout is required. The entire focal plane detector can be formed from smaller, individual sub-arrays. Neutral density filter for hard x-rays (> 1 keV) to provide attenuation by a factor of 10 to 1000 or more.

Proposals that address the development of supporting technologies that would help enable X-ray Surveyor mission that requires the development of X-ray microcalorimeter arrays with much larger field of view, ~105-106 pixels, of pitch ~ 25-100 um, and ways to read out the signals. For example, modular superconducting magnetic shielding is sought that can be extended to enclose a full scale focal plane array. All joints between segments of the shielding enclosure must also be superconducting.

As such, technological improvements to cryogenic systems further advance the mission goals of NASA through enabling performance (and ultimately science gathering) capabilities of flight detectors and sensors. There are four potential investment areas that NASA is seeking to expand state of the art capabilities for possible use on future programs such as WFirst (http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/), the Europa Jupiter System Science missions (http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/podcasting/jpl-europa20090218.html), and flagship missions under consideration for the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey (http://cor.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/PCOS_facility_missions_report_final.pdf). The topic areas are: Cryocooler Systems and Components Miniaturized/Efficient Cryocooler Systems - Cryocooler systems are sought for application on SmallSat and small low power instrument space platforms. Present state-of-the-art capabilities provide 0.4 W of cooling at 77 K with approximately 5 W input power, while rejecting heat at 300 K, and having a system mass of 400 grams. Desired performance specifications for cryocoolers include a cooling capability on the order of 0.2 W at a temperature of approximately 30 K. For application on missions to outer planets, cryocoolers are needed with a cooling power of 0.3 W at approximately 35 K, with a heat rejection temperature as low as 150 K. Desired masses and input powers in both cases are < 400 grams and < 5W respectively. Component level improvements are also desirable. Low Temperature/High Efficiency Cryocoolers - High efficiency, multi-stage coolers with a low temperature stage capable of reaching 4 to 10 K will be needed for future astrophysics missions. Current state-of-the-art coolers include a device providing 0.04 W at 4.5 K and another providing 0.09 W at 6 K. Cryocoolers are sought that provide higher cooling power, for example >0.3 W at 10 K, with high efficiency. Devices that produce extremely low vibration, particularly at frequencies below a few hundred Hz are of special interest. Component level improvements are also desirable. Cryogenic/Rad-Hard Accelerometers - Accelerometers that can operate at 150 K, withstand a 0.01 Tesla magnetic field and are radiation hard to mega-rad level doses are needed for cryocooler control and monitoring in missions to outer planets. Sub-Kelvin Cooling Systems Magnetic Cooling Systems - Sub-Kelvin cooling systems include Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerators (ADRs) and Active Magnetic Regenerative Refrigerators (AMRRs). The ADR in the Soft X-ray Spectrometer instrument on the Hitomi mission represents the state of the art in sub-Kelvin cooling systems for space application. Future missions requiring sub-Kelvin coolers will need devices that provide lower operating temperature (<50 mK), higher (preferably 100%) duty cycle, higher heat rejection temperature (preferably > 10K), higher overall system efficiency, and lower mass. Improvements at the component level are needed to achieve these goals. Specific components sought include: Compact, lightweight, low current superconducting magnets capable of producing a field of at least 4 Tesla while operating at a temperature of at least 10 K, and preferably above 15 K. Desirable properties include: A high engineering current density, preferably > 300 Amp/mm2. A field/current ratio of >0.33 Tesla/Amp, and preferably >0.66 Tesla/Amp. Low hysteresis heating. Lightweight Active/Passive magnetic shielding (for use with 4 Tesla magnets) with low hysteresis and eddy current losses, and low remanence.

Atom interferometers exploit the quantum mechanical wave nature of atomic particles and quantum gases for sensitive interferometric measurements. Ground-based laboratory experiments and instruments have already demonstrated beyond the state of the art performances of accelerometer, gyroscope, and gravity measurements. The microgravity environment in space provides opportunities for further drastic improvements in sensitivity and precision. Such inertial sensors will have great potential to provide new capabilities for NASA Earth and planetary gravity measurements, for spacecraft inertial navigation and guidance, and for gravitational wave detection and test of properties of gravity in space. Currently the most mature development of atom interferometers as measurement instruments are those based on light pulsed atom interferometers with freefall cold atoms. There remain a number of technical challenges to infuse this technology in space applications. Some of the identified key challenges are (but not limited to): Compact high flux ultra-cold atom sources for free space atom interferometers (Example: >1x106 total useful free-space atoms, <1 nK, Rb, K, Cs, Yb, Sr, and Hg.

Flight qualifiable lasers or laser systems of narrow linewidth, high tunability, and/or higher power for clock and cooling transitions of atomic species of interest. Cooling and trapping lasers: 10 kHz linewidth and ~ 1 W or greater total optical power. Compact clock lasers: 5x10-15 Hz/τ1/2 near 1 s (wavelengths for Yb+, Yb, Sr clock transitions are of special interest). Analysis and simulation tool of a cold atom system in trapped and freefall states relevant to atom interferometer and clock measurements in space.

For the NASA Roadmap for Ocean World Exploration see: http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/ROW(link is external). The icy moons of the outer Solar System are of astrobiological interest. The most dramatic target for sampling from a plume is for Enceladus. Enceladus is a small icy moon of Saturn, with a radius of only 252km. Cassini data have revealed about a dozen or so jets of fine icy particles emerging from the south polar region of Enceladus. The jets have also been shown to contain organic compounds, and the south-polar region is warmed by heat flow coming from below. As a target for future missions, Enceladus rates high because fresh samples of interest are jetting into space ready for collection. Indeed, Enceladus has been added to the current call for New Frontiers missions with a focus on habitability and life detection. Particles from Enceladus also form the E-ring around Saturn. The particles in the E-ring are known to contain organics and are thus also an important target for sample collection and analysis. Recent data have indicated a possible plume at Europa that may also be carrying ocean water from that world into space. In addition to plumes, there are other energetic processes that can spray material from the surface of these low-gravity worlds into space where they could also be collected in-flight and analyzed. Collecting samples for a variety of science purposes is required. These include samples that allow for determination of the chemical and physical properties of the source ocean, samples for detailed characterization of the organics present in the gas and particle phases, and samples for analysis for biomarkers indicative of life. Thus these “Ocean Worlds” of the outer Solar System offer the opportunity for a conceptually new approach to life detection focusing on in-flight sample collection of material freshly injected into space. Technologies of particular interest include sample collection systems and subsystems capable of: Capture, containment, and/or transfer of gas, liquid, ice, and/or mineral phases from plumes to sample processing and/or instrument interfaces.

Potential architecture implementations must package into an existing launch volume, deploy and be self-aligning to the micron level. The target space environment is expected to be the Earth-Sun L2. This subtopic solicits proposals to develop enabling, cost effective component and subsystem technology for deploying large aperture telescopes with low cost. Research areas of interest include: Precision deployable structures and metrology for optical telescopes (e.g., innovative active or passive deployable primary or secondary support structures). Architectures, packaging and deployment designs for large sunshields and external occulters. In particular, important subsystem considerations may include: Innovative concepts for packaging fully integrated subsystems (e.g., power distribution, sensing, and control components). Mechanical, inflatable, or other precision deployable technologies. Thermally-stable materials (CTE < 1ppm) for deployable structures. Innovative systems, which minimize complexity, mass, power and cost. Innovative testing and verification methodologies. The goal for this effort is to mature technologies that can be used to fabricate 16 m class or greater, lightweight, ambient or cryogenic flight-qualified observatory systems. Proposals to fabricate demonstration components and subsystems with direct scalability to flight systems through validated models will be given preference. The target launch volume and expected disturbances, along with the estimate of system performance, should be included in the discussion. Proposals with system solutions for large sunshields and external occulters will also be accepted. A successful proposal shows a path toward a Phase II delivery of demonstration hardware scalable to 5 meter diameter for ground test characterization. Before embarking on the design and fabrication of complex space-based deployable telescopes, additional risk reduction in operating an actively controlled telescope in orbit is desired. To be cost effective, deployable apertures that conform to a cubesat (up to 3-U) or ESPA format are desired. Consequently, deployment hinge and latching concepts, buildable for these missions and scaleable to larger systems are desired. Such a system should allow <25 micron deployment repeatability and sub-micron stability for both thermal and mechanical on-orbit disturbances. A successful proposal would deliver a full-scale cubesat or ESPA ring compatible deployable aperture with mock optical elements. Proposals should show an understanding of one or more relevant science needs, and present a feasible plan to fully develop the relevant subsystem technologies and to transition into future NASA program(s).

Focus Area 10 Advanced Telescope Technologies,S2.03Advanced Optical Systems and Fabrication/Testing/Control Technologies for EUV/Optical and IR Telescope, MSFC," GSFC, JPL"," TA8 Science Instruments, Observatories & Sensor Systems", 2017,"This subtopic matures technologies needed to affordably manufacture, test or operate complete mirror systems or telescope assemblies. Solutions are solicited in the following areas: Components and Systems for potential EUV, UV/O or Far-IR mission telescopes. Technology to fabricate, test and control potential UUV, UV/O or Far-IR telescopes. Specific needs are listed in the Technical Challenges Section. New for 2017 are two areas using additive manufacturing technology: Lightweight mirror substrates for Far-IR with < 100 nm rms cryo-deformation at 10K. Ultra-stable support structures for potential telescope assemblies: 0.5 meter LISA, 4-m monolithic HabEx, or 12-m segmented LUVOIR. Proposals must show an understanding of one or more relevant science needs, and present a feasible plan to develop the proposed technology for infusion into a NASA program: sub-orbital rocket or balloon; competed SMEX or MIDEX; or, Decadal class mission. An ideal Phase I deliverable would be a precision optical system of at least 0.25 meters; or a relevant sub-component of a system; or a prototype demonstration of a fabrication, test or control technology leading to a successful Phase II delivery; or a reviewed preliminary design and manufacturing plan which demonstrates feasibility. While detailed analysis will be conducted in Phase II, the preliminary design should address how optical, mechanical (static and dynamic) and thermal designs and performance analysis will be done to show compliance with all requirements. Past experience or technology demonstrations which support the design and manufacturing plans will be given appropriate weight in the evaluation. An ideal Phase II project would further advance the technology to produce a flight-qualifiable optical system greater than 0.5 meters or relevant sub-component (with a TRL in the 4 to 5 range); or a working fabrication, test or control system. Phase I and Phase II mirror system or component deliverables would be accompanied by all necessary documentation, including the optical performance assessment and all data on processing and properties of its substrate materials. A successful mission oriented Phase II would have a credible plan to deliver for the allocated budget a fully assembled and tested telescope assembly which can be integrated into the potential mission; and, demonstrate an understanding of how the engineering specifications of their system meets the performance requirements and operational constraints of the mission (including mechanical and thermal stability analysis). Successful proposals will demonstrate an ability to manufacture, test and control ultra-low-cost optical systems that can meet science performance requirements and mission requirements (including processing and infrastructure issues). Material behavior, process control, active and/or passive optical performance, and mounting/deploying issues should be resolved and demonstrated. Technical Challenges To accomplish NASA’s high-priority science requires low-cost, ultra-stable, large-aperture, normal incidence mirrors with low mass-to-collecting area ratios. After performance, the most important metric for an advanced optical system is affordability or areal cost (cost per square meter of collecting aperture). Current normal incidence space mirrors cost $4 million to $6 million per square meter of optical surface area. This research effort seeks a cost reduction for precision optical components by 5 to 50 times, to between $100K/m2 to $1M/m2. Specific metrics are defined for each wavelength application region: Aperture Diameter for all wavelengths Monolithic: 1 to 8 meters Segmented: > 12 meters For UV/Optical Areal Cost < $500K/m2 Wavefront Figure < 5 nm RMS Wavefront Stability < 10 pm/10 min First Mode Frequency 250 to 500 Hz Actuator Resolution < 1 nm RMS For Far-IR Areal Cost for Far-IR < $100K/m2 Cryo-deformation for Far-IR < 100 nm RMS For EUV Slope < 0.1 micro-radian Also needed is ability to fully characterize surface errors and predict optical performance. 1. Optical Components and Systems for potential UV/Optical Missions Large UV/Optical (LUVOIR) and Habitable Exoplanet (HabEx) Missions Potential UV/Optical missions require 4 to 16 meter monolithic or segmented primary mirrors with < 5 nm RMS surface figures. Active or passive alignment and control is required to achieve system level diffraction limited performance at wavelengths less than 500 nm (< 40 nm RMS wavefront error, WFE). Additionally, potential Exoplanet mission, using an internal coronagraph, requires total telescope wavefront stability on order of 10 pico-meters RMS per 10 minutes. This stability specification places severe constraints on the dynamic mechanical and thermal performance of 4 meter and larger telescope. To meet this requirement requires active thermal control systems, ultra-stable mirror support structures, and vibration compensation. Mirror areal density depends upon available launch vehicle capacities to Sun-Earth L2 (i.e., 15 kg/m2 for a 5 m fairing EELV vs. 150 kg/m2 for a 10 m fairing SLS). Regarding areal cost, a good goal is to keep the total cost of the primary mirror at or below $100M. Thus, an 8-m class mirror (with 50 m2 of collecting area) should have an areal cost of less than $2M/m2. And, a 16-m class mirror (with 200 m2 of collecting area) should have an areal cost of less than $0.5M/m2. Key technologies to enable such a mirror include new and improved: Mirror substrate materials and/or architectural designs. Processes to rapidly fabricate and test UVO quality mirrors. Mirror support structures that are ultra-stable at the desired scale. Mirror support structures with low-mass that can survive launch at the desired scale. Mechanisms and sensors to align segmented mirrors to < 1 nm RMS precisions. Thermal control (< 1 mK) to reduce wavefront stability to < 10 pm RMS per 10 min. Dynamic isolation (> 140 dB) to reduce wavefront stability to < 10 pm RMS per 10 min. Also needed is ability to fully characterize surface errors and predict optical performance via integrated opto-mechanical modeling. Potential solutions for substrate material/architecture include, but are not limited to: ultra-uniform low CTE glasses, silicon carbide, nanolaminates or carbon-fiber reinforced polymer. Potential solutions for mirror support structure material/architecture include, but are not limited to: additive manufacturing, nature inspired architectures, nano-particle composites, carbon fiber, graphite composite, ceramic or SiC materials, etc. Potential solutions for new fabrication processes include, but are not limited to: additive manufacture, direct precision machining, rapid optical fabrication, roller embossing at optical tolerances, slumping or replication technologies to manufacture 1 to 2 meter (or larger) precision quality components. Potential solutions for achieving the 10 pico-meter wavefront stability include, but are not limited to: metrology, passive, and active control for optical alignment and mirror phasing; active vibration isolation; metrology, passive, and active thermal control; Ultra-Stable Balloon Telescopes and Telescope Structures Multiple potential balloon and space missions to perform Astrophysics, Exoplanet and Planetary science investigations require a complete optical telescope system with 0.5 meter or larger of collecting aperture. 1-m class balloon-borne telescopes have flown successfully, however, the cost for design and construction of such telescopes can exceed $6M, and the weight of these telescopes limits the scientific payload and duration of the balloon mission. A 4X reduction in cost and mass would enable missions which today are not feasible. Space-based gravitational wave observatories (eLISA) need a 0.5 meter class ultra-stable telescope with an optical path length stability of a picometer over periods of roughly one hour at temperatures near 230K in the presence of large applied thermal gradients. The telescope will be operated in simultaneous transmit and receive mode, so an unobstructed design is required to achieve extremely low backscatter light performance. Exoplanet Balloon Mission Telescope A potential exoplanet mission seeks a 1-m class wide-field telescope with diffraction-limited performance in the visible and a field of view > 0.5 degree. The telescope will operate over a temperature range of +10 to -70 C at an altitude of 35 km. It must survive temperatures as low as -80 C during ascent. The telescope should weigh less than 250 kg and is required to maintain diffraction-limited performance over: The entire temperature range. Pitch range from 25 to 55 degrees elevation. Azimuth range of 0 to 360 degrees. Roll range of –10 to +10 degrees. The telescope will be used in conjunction with an existing high-performance pointing stabilization system. Planetary Science Balloon Mission Telescope A potential planetary balloon mission requires an optical telescope system with at least 1-meter aperture for UV, visible, near- and mid-IR imaging and multi/hyperspectral imaging, with the following optical, mechanical and operational requirements: Optical Requirements: ≥ 1-meter clear aperture. Diffraction-limited performance at wavelengths ≥ 0.5 μm over entire FOV. System focal length: 14.052-meters. Wavelength range: 0.3 – 1.0 μm and 2.5 – 5.0 μm. Field of view: 60 arc-sec in 0.3 – 1.0 μm band, 180 arc-sec in 2.5 – 5.0 μm band. Straylight rejection ratio ≥ 1e-9. Mechanical/Operational Requirements: Overall length: ≤ 2.75 meters. Overall diameter: ≤ 1.25 meters. Mass: ≤ 250 kg. Temperature: -80 to +50°C. Humidity: ≤ 95% RH (non-condensing). Pressure: sea level to 1 micron Hg. Shock: 10G without damage. Elevation angle range: 0° to 70° operating, -90° to + 90° non-operating. Other Requirements: Must allow field disassembly with standard hand tools. Maximum mass of any sub-assembly < 90 kg. Largest sub-assembly must pass through rectangular opening 56 by 50 inches (1.42 by 1.27 meters). 2. Optical Components and Systems for potential Infrared/Far-IR missions Large Aperture Far-IR Surveyor Mission Potential Infrared and Far-IR missions require 8 m to 24 meter class monolithic or segmented primary mirrors with ~ 1 μm RMS surface figure error which operates at < 10 K. There are three primary challenges for such a mirror system: Areal Cost of < $100K per m2. Areal Mass of < 15 kg per m2 substrate (< 30 kg per m2 assembly). Cryogenic Figure Distortion < 100 nm RMS from 300K to <10K. Infrared Interferometry Balloon Mission Telescope A balloon-borne interferometry mission requires 0.5 meter class telescopes with siderostat steering flat mirror. There are several technologies which can be used for production of mirrors for balloon projects (aluminum, carbon fiber, glass, etc.), but they are high mass and high cost. 3. Fabrication, Test and Control of Advanced Optical Systems While Sections 1 and 2 detail the capabilities need to enable potential future UVO and IR missions, it is important to note that this capability is made possible by the technology to fabricate, test, and control optical systems. Therefore, this subtopic also encourages proposals to develop such technology which will make a significant advance of a measurable metric. Read less>>"
Focus Area 10 Advanced Telescope Technologies,"S2.04X-Ray Mirror Systems Technology, Coating Technology for X-Ray-UV-OIR, and Free-Form Optics", GSFC," JPL, MSFC"," TA8 Science Instruments, Observatories & Sensor Systems", 2017,"This subtopic solicits proposals in the following areas: Components, Systems, and Technologies of potential X-Ray missions. Coating technologies for X-Ray, EUV (extreme ultraviolet), LUV (Lyman ultraviolet), VUV (vacuum ultraviolet), Visible, and IR (infrared) telescopes. Free-form Optics surfaces design, fabrication, and metrology. This subtopic focuses on three areas of technology development: X-Ray manufacturing, coating, testing, and assembling complete mirror systems in addition to maturing the current technology. Coating technology including Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) for wide range of wavelengths from X-Ray to IR (X-Ray, EUV, LUV, VUV, Visible, and IR). Free-form Optics design, fabrication, and metrology for CubeSat, SmallSat and various coronagraphic instruments. A typical Phase I proposal for X-Ray technology would address the relevant optical sub-component of a system with necessary coating and stray light suppression for X-Ray missions or prototype demonstration of a fabricated system and its testing. Similarly, a Coating technology proposal would address fabrication and testing of optical surfaces for a wide range of wavelengths from X-Ray, EUV, LUV, VUV, Visible and IR. The Free-form Optics proposals tackle the challenges involved in design, fabrication, and metrology of non-spherical surfaces for small-size missions such as CubeSat, NanoSat, and coronagraphic instruments. In a nutshell, a successful proposal demonstrates a low-cost ability to address NASA science mission needs and technical challenges specified under each category with feasible plan to develop the technology for infusion into NASA Decadal class missions and sub-orbital rockets and/or balloon for IR-class telescopes. The National Academy Astro2010 Decadal Report identifies studies of optical components and ability to manufacture, coat, and perform metrology needed to enable future X-Ray observatory missions such as Next Generation of X-Ray Observatories (NGXO). The Astrophysics Decadal specifically calls for optical coating technology investment for future UV, Optical, Exoplanet, and IR missions while Heliophysics 2009 Roadmap identifies the coating technology for space missions to enhance rejection of undesirable spectral lines, improve space/solar-flux durability of EUV optical coatings, and coating deposition to increase the maximum spatial resolution. Future optical systems for NASAs low-cost missions, CubeSat and other small-scale payloads, are moving away from traditional spherical optics to non-spherical surfaces with anticipated benefits of freeform optics such as fast wide-field and distortion-free cameras. Technical Challenges: X-Ray Optical Component, Systems, and Technologies NASA large X-Ray observatory requires low-cost, ultra-stable, light-weight mirrors with high-reflectance optical coatings and effective stray light suppression. The current state-of-art of mirror fabrication technology for X-Ray missions is very expensive and time consuming. Additionally, a number of improvements such as 10 arc-second angular resolutions and 1 to 5 m2 collecting area are needed for this technology. Likewise, the stray-light suppression system is bulky and ineffective for wide-field of view telescopes. In this area, we are looking to address the multiple technologies including: improvements to manufacturing (machining, rapid optical fabrication, slumping or replication technologies), improved metrology, performance prediction and testing techniques, active control of mirror shapes, new structures for holding and actively aligning of mirrors in a telescope assembly to enable X-Ray observatories while lowering the cost per square meter of collecting aperture and effective design of stray-light suppression in preparation for the Decadal Survey of 2020. Currently, X-Ray space mirrors cost $4 million to $6 million per square meter of optical surface area. This research effort seeks a cost reduction for precision optical components by 5 to 50 times, to less than $1M to $100 K/m2. Coating Technologies for X-Ray, EUV, LUV, UV, Visible, and IR Telescopes The optical coating technology is a mission-enabling feature that enhances the optical performance and science return of a mission. Lowering the areal cost of coating determines if a proposed mission could be funded in the current cost environment. The most common forms of coating used on precision optics are anti-reflective (AR) coating and high reflective coating. The current coating technology of optical components needs to achieve TRL-6 by approximately 2018 to support the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal process. A number of optical coating metrics specific to each wavelength are desired such as: The Optical Coating Metrics The telescope optical coating needs to meet low temperature operation requirement. It’s desirable to achieve 35° Kelvin in future. X-Ray Metrics: Multilayer high-reflectance coatings for hard X-Ray mirrors similar to NuSTAR. Multilayer depth gradient coatings for 5 to 80 KeV with high broadband reflectivity. Zero-net-stress coating for iridium or other high-reflectance elements on thin substrates (< 0.5 mm). EUV Metrics: Reflectivity > 90% from 6 nm to 90 nm and the ability to be applied onto a < 2 meter mirror substrate. LUVOIR Metrics: Broadband reflectivity > 70% from 90 nm to 120 nm (LUV); > 90% from 120 nm to 2500 nm (VUV/Visible/IR); Reflectivity non-uniformity < 1% from 90 nm to 2500 nm. Induced polarization aberration < 1% from 400 nm to 2500 nm and depositable onto 1 to 8 m substrates. Non-Stationary Metric: Non- uniform optical coating to be used in both reflection and transmission that vary with location and optical surface. Variation pertains to ratio of reflectivity to transmissivity, optical field amplitude, phase, and polarization change. The optical surface area ranges from1/2 to 6 cm. Scattered Light Suppression Using Carbon Nanotube (CNT) Coating A number of future NASA missions require suppression of scattered light. For instance, the precision optical cube utilized in a beam-splitter application forms a knife-edge that is positioned within the optical system to split a single beam into two halves. The scattered light from the knife-edge could be suppressed by CNT coating. Similarly, the scattered light for gravitational-wave application and lasercom system where the simultaneous transmit/receive operation is required, could be achieved by highly absorbing coating such as CNT. Ideally, the application of CNT coating needs to achieve: Broadband (visible plus Near IR), reflectivity of 0.1% or less. Resist bleaching of significant albedo changes over a mission life of at least 10 years. Withstand launch conditions such vibe, acoustics, etc. Tolerate both high continuous wave (CW) and pulsed power and power densities without damage. ~10 W for CE and ~ 0.1 GW/cm2 density, and 1 kW/nanosecond pulses. Adhere to the multi-layer dielectric or protected metal coating including Ion Beam Sputtering (IBS) coating. Freeform Optics Design, Fabrication, and Metrology Future NASA missions with alternative low-cost science and small-size payload are constrained by the traditional spherical form of optics. These missions could benefit greatly by the freeform optics as they provide non-spherical optics with better aerodynamic characteristics for spacecraft with lightweight components to meet the mission requirements. Currently, the design and utilization of conformal and freeform shapes are costly due to fabrication and metrology of these parts. Even though various techniques are being investigated to create complex optical surfaces, small-size missions highly desire efficient small packages with lower cost that increase the field of view and expand operational temperature range of un-obscured systems. For the coronagraphic applications, freeform optical components allow coronagraphic nulling without shearing and increase the useful science field of view. In this category, freeform optical prescription for surfaces of 0.5 cm to 6 cm diameters with tolerances of 1 to 2 nm rms are needed. In this respect, the freeform refers to either 2nd order conic prescription with higher order surface polished onto it or without underlying conic prescription with no steps in the surface. The optics with underlying conic prescription would need to be in F/# range of F/2 to F/20. In addition to the freeform fabrication, the metrology of freeform optical components is difficult and challenging due to the large departure from planar or spherical shapes accommodated by conventional interferometric testing. New methods such as multibeam low-coherence optical probe and slope sensitive optical probe are highly desirable. Ultra-Stable X-Ray Grazing-Incident Telescopes for Sub-Orbital Balloons and Rocket-Borne Missions Technology maturation to build complete low-cost, lightweight X-ray telescopes with grazing-incident optics that can be flown on potential long duration high-altitude balloon-borne or rocket-borne missions. The focus here is to reduce the areal cost of telescope by 2x such that the larger collecting area can be produced for the same cost or half the cost. Read less>>"
Focus Area 11 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,S3.05Terrestrial and Planetary Balloons, GSFC, JPL, TA5 Communication and Navigation, 2017,"Terrestrial Balloons NASA’s Scientific Balloons provide practical and cost effective platforms for conducting discovery science, development and testing for future space instruments, as well as training opportunities for future scientists and engineers. Balloons can reach altitudes above 36 kilometers, with suspended masses up to 3600 kilograms, and can stay afloat for several weeks. Currently, the Balloon Program is on the verge of introducing an advanced balloon system that will enable 100 day missions at mid-latitudes and thus resemble the performance of a small spacecraft at a fraction of the cost. In support of this development, NASA is seeking innovative technologies in power storage and satellite communications bitrates as described below: Power Storage - Improved and innovative devices to store electrical energy onboard balloon payloads are needed. Long duration balloon flights can experience 12 hours or more of darkness, and excess electrical power generated during the day from solar panels needs to be stored and used. Improvements are needed over the current state of the art in power density, energy density, overall size, overall mass and/or cost. Typical parameters for balloon are 28 VDC and 100 to 1000 watts power consumption. Rechargeable batteries are presently used for balloon payload applications. Lithium Ion rechargeable batteries with energy densities of 60 watt-hours per kilogram are the current state of the art. Higher power storage energy densities, and power generation capabilities of up to 2000 watts are needed for future support. Satellite Communications - Improved and innovative downlink bitrates using satellite relay communications from balloon payloads are needed. Long duration balloon flights currently utilize satellite communication systems to relay science and operations data from the balloon to ground based control centers. The current maximum downlink bit rate is 150 kilobits per second operating continuously during the balloon flight. Future requirements are for bit rates of 1 megabit per second or more. Improvements in bit rate performance, reduction in size and mass of existing systems, or reductions in cost of high bit rate systems are needed. TDRSS and Iridium satellite communications are currently used for balloon payload applications. A commercial S-band TDRSS transceiver and mechanically steered 18 dBi gain antenna provide 150 kbps continuous downlink. TDRSS K-band transceivers are available but are currently cost prohibitive. Open port Iridium service is under development, but the operational cost is prohibitive. Planetary Balloons Innovations in materials, structures, and systems concepts have enabled buoyant vehicles to play an expanding role in planning NASA's future Solar System Exploration Program. Balloons are expected to carry scientific payloads at Venus that will perform in-situ investigations of the atmosphere. Venus features extreme environments that significantly impact the design of balloons. Proposals are sought in the following areas: Floating Platforms for Venus - NASA is interested in conducting long term monitoring of the Venus atmosphere and the signatures of seismic and volcanic events from the planetary surface using floating platforms at altitudes of between 50 and 60 km for periods in excess of 100 days. The temperature at 50 km is roughly 75°C; at 60 km it is about -10°C. Sulfuric acid aerosols are known to exist in this altitude range on Venus. A target payload mass of 100 kg shall be used for system sizing purposes. The primary focus should be on the design of the floating platform system and the materials for achieving long duration operation. Concepts may include fixed altitude and/or variable altitude (controlled) floating vehicles. Systems that use alternative lift gases such as ammonia, or phase change fluids should be considered. Traditional lift gases such as helium or hydrogen are acceptable. Additional areas of interest for developing floating platforms include: Analytical tools for predicting vehicle dynamic behavior in the atmosphere. Packaging and storage methods for inflatable components. Methods for deployment, inflation, and component separation during descent in the atmosphere. It is expected that a Phase I effort will consist of a system-level design and a proof-of-concept experiment on one or more key components. Read less>>"
Focus Area 11 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,S3.07Slow and Fast Light, MSFC, JPL, TA5 Communication and Navigation, 2017,"Steep dispersions in engineered media of a wide variety have opened up a new direction of research in optics. A positive dispersion can be used to slow the propagation of optical pulses to extremely small velocities. Similarly, a negative dispersion can lead to conditions where pulses propagate superluminally. These effects have now moved beyond the stage of intellectual curiosity, and have ushered in studies of a set of exciting applications of interest to NASA, ranging from ultraprecise superluminal gyroscopes to spectral interferometers having enhanced resolving power. This research subtopic seeks slow-light and/or fast-light enhanced sensors for space applications of interest to NASA including: Superluminal gyroscopes and accelerometers (both passive and active) Enhanced strain and displacement sensors for non-destructive evaluation and integrated vehicle health management applications. Slow-light-enhanced spectrally-resolved interferometers for astrophysical and Earth science observations, as well as for exploration goals. Other applications of slow and fast light related to NASAs mission areas. Superluminal Gyroscopes In conventional ring laser gyroscopes, sensitivity increases with cavity size. Fast light, however, can be used to increase gyro sensitivity without having to increase size, for spacecraft navigation systems which are constrained by weight and volume. The increased sensitivity also opens up new science possibilities such as detection of subsurface geological features, tests of Lorentz invariance, improving the bandwidth sensitivity product for gravity wave detection, and tests of general relativity. This research subtopic seeks: Prototype fast light gyroscopes, active or passive, that unambiguously demonstrate a scale factor enhancement of at least 10 with the potential for 1000. The minimum or quantum-noise limited angular random walk (ARW) should also decrease. Designs for fast light gyros that do not require frequency locking, are not limited to operation at specific frequencies such as atomic or material resonances, and permit operation at any wavelength. Fast light gyroscope designs that are rugged, compact, monolithic, rad-hard, and tolerant to variations in temperature and varying G-conditions. Slow-Light Enhanced Spectral Interferometers Slow light has the potential to increase the resolving power of spectral interferometers such as Fourier transform spectrometers (FTS) for astrophysical applications without increasing their size. Mariner, Voyager, and Cassini all used FTS instruments for applications such as mapping atmospheres and examining ring compositions. The niche for FTS is usually thought to be for large wavelength (IR and beyond), wide-field, moderate spectral resolution instruments. Slow light, however, could help boost FTS spectral resolution making FTS instruments more competitive with grating-based instruments, and opening up application areas not previously thought to be accessible to FTS instruments, such as exoplanet detection. A slow-light FTS could also be hyper-spectral, providing imaging capability. FTS instruments have been employed for remote sensing on NASA Earth Science missions, such as the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS), Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) experiments, and have long been considered for geostationary imaging of atmospheric greenhouse gases. This research subtopic seeks research and development of slow-light-enhanced spectral interferometers that are not restricted by material resonances and can operate at any wavelength. An inherent advantage of FTS systems are their wide bandwidth. It will therefore of importance to develop slow light FTS systems that can maintain a large operating bandwidth. Read less>>"

Identify the improvements over the current state of the art. Outline the feasibility of the technical and programmatic approach. Present how it could be infused into a NASA program. Furthermore, proposals developing hardware should indicate an understanding of the intended operating environment, including temperature and radiation. It should be noted that environmental requirements can vary significantly from mission to mission.

Shielding thicknesses must be able to achieve up to 3 g/cm2 for initial shielding applications. At the end of Phase I, delivery of layered slabs and/or half sphere samples is expected with areal densities from 1 -3 g/cm2; samples must be able to show a strong interface property to avoid delamination and consistent density and thickness (areal density) uniformity.

Includes propellants that are transported along with the mission or propellants that can be generated using local resources. Other targets are small bodies with very complex geography and very little gravity, which present difficult navigational and maneuvering challenges. In addition, the spacecraft will be subject to extreme environmental conditions including low temperatures (-270°C), dust, and ice particles.

Focus Area 11 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,S4.05Contamination Control and Planetary Protection, JPL," ARC, GRC, GSFC, LaRC, MSFC"," TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems", 2017,"A need to develop technologies to implement Contamination Control and Planetary Protection requirements has emerged in recent years with increased interest in investigating bodies with the potential for life detection such as Europa, Enceladus, Mars, etc. and the potential for sample return from such bodies. Planetary Protection is concerned with both forward and backward contamination. Forward contamination is the transfer of viable organisms from Earth to another body. Backward contamination is the transfer of material posing a biological threat back to Earth's biosphere. NASA is seeking innovative technologies or applications of technologies to facilitate meeting portions of forward and backward contamination Planetary Protection requirements as well as analytical technologies that can ensure hardware and instrumentation can meet organic contamination requirements in an effort to preserve sample science integrity. For contamination control efforts, analytical technologies and techniques for quantifying submicron particle and organic contamination for validating surface cleaning methods are needed. In particular, capabilities for measuring Total Organic Carbon (TOC) at <<40 ppb or <<20 ng/cm2 on a surface and detection of particles <0.2 microns in size are being sought. In addition, techniques for detection of one or more of the following molecules and detection level are being needed: DNA (1 fmole). Dipicolinic acid (1 pg). N-acetylglucosamine (1 pg). Glycine and alanine (1 pg). Palmitic acid (1 pg). Sqalene (1 pg). Pristane (1pg). Chlorobenzene (<1 pg). Dichloromethane (<1 pg). Naphthalene (1 pg). For many missions, Planetary Protection requirements are often implemented in part by processing hardware or potentially entire spacecraft with one or more sterilization processes. These processes are often incompatible with particular materials or components on the spacecraft and extensive effort is made to try to mitigate these issues. Innovative new or improved sterilization/re-sterilization processes are being sought for application to spacecraft hardware to increase effectiveness of reducing bio-load on spacecraft or increase process compatibility with hardware (e.g., toxicity to hardware, temperature, duration, etc.). Accepted processes currently include heat processing, gamma/electron beam irradiation, cold plasma, and vapor hydrogen peroxide. Options to improve materials and parts (e.g., sensors, seals, in particular, batteries, valves, and optical coatings) to be compatible with currently accepted processes, in particular heat tolerance, are needed. NASA is seeking novel technologies for preventing recontamination of sterilized components or spacecraft as a whole (e.g., biobarriers). In addition, active in-situ recontamination/decontamination approaches (e.g., in-situ heating of sample containers to drive off volatiles prior to sample collection) and in-situ sterilization approaches (e.g., UV or plasma) for surfaces are desired. Missions planning sample return from bodies such as Mars, Europa, and Enceladus are faced with developing technologies for sample return functions to assure containment of material from these bodies. Thus far, concepts have been developed specifically for Mars sample return but no end-to-end concepts have been developed that do not have technical challenges remaining in one or more areas. Options for sample canisters with seal(s) (e.g., brazing, explosive welding, soft) with sealing performed either on surface or in orbit and capability to verify seal(s), potentially by leak detection are needed. In addition, capability is needed for opening seals while maintaining sample integrity upon Earth return. These technologies need to be compatible with processes the materials may encounter over the lifecycle of the mission (e.g., high temperature heating). Containment assurance also requires technologies to break-the-chain of contact with the sampled body. Any native contamination on the returned sample container and/or Earth return vehicle must be either be fully contained, sterilized, or removed prior to return to Earth, therefore, technologies or concepts to mitigate this contamination are desired. Lightweight shielding technologies are also needed for meteoroid protection for the Earth entry vehicle and sample canister with capability to detect damage or breach to meet a 10-6 probability of loss of containment.Read less>>"

A hot structure is a type of multifunctional structure that can reduce or eliminate the need for a separate thermal protection system (TPS) to protect the structure. The potential advantages of using a hot structure in place of a cool structure with a separate TPS are: reduced mass, increased mission capability such as reusability, improved aerodynamics, improved structural efficiency, and increased ability to inspect the structure. Hot structures is an enabling technology for reusability between missions or mission phases, such as aerocapture followed by entry, and have been used in many prior NASA programs: Space Shuttle (nosecap and leading edges), HyperX (nose and all-moving control surfaces), X-37 (flaperon and ruddervator control surfaces), and many Department of Defense programs.

"Focus Area 12 Entry, Descent, and Landing Systems","S4.01Planetary Entry, Descent and Landing and Small Body Proximity Operation Technology", JPL," ARC, JSC, LaRC"," TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems", 2017,"NASA seeks innovative sensor technologies to enhance success for entry, descent and landing (EDL) operations on missions to other planetary bodies, including Earth's Moon, Mars, Venus, Titan, Europa, and proximity operations (including sampling and landing) on small bodies such as asteroids and comets. Sensing technologies are desired that determine any number of the following: Terrain relative translational state (altimetry/3-axis velocimetry). Spacecraft absolute state in planetary/small-body frame (either attitude, translation, or both). Terrain point cloud (for hazard detection, absolute state estimation, landing/sampling site selection, and/or body shape characterization). Atmosphere-relative measurements (velocimetry, pressure, temperature, flow-relative orientation). NASA also seeks to use measurements made during EDL to better characterize the atmosphere of planetary bodies, providing data for improving atmospheric modeling for future landers or ascent vehicles. Successful candidate sensor technologies can address this call by: Extending the dynamic range over which such measurements are collected (e.g., providing a single surface topology sensor that works over a large altitude range such as 1m to >10km, and high attitude rates such as greater than 45° /sec). Improving the state-of-the-art in measurement accuracy/precision/resolution for the above sensor needs. Substantially reducing the amount of external processing needed by the host vehicle to calculate the measurements. Significantly reducing the impact of incorporating such sensors on the spacecraft in terms of Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP), spacecraft accomodation complexity, and/or cost. Providing sensors that are robust to environmental dust/sand/illumination effects.

"Focus Area 12 Entry, Descent, and Landing Systems","Z7.01Supersonic Parachute Inflation Materials Testing, And Instrumentation", JPL, LaRC," TA9 Entry, Descent and Landing Systems", 2017,"Mars landed missions have traditionally relied on large (nominal diameter between 11.5 and 21.5 m) disk-gap-band (DGB) parachutes that must be inflated between Mach 1.2 and 2.2 at dynamic pressures between 300 and 850 Pa to ensure that the terminal landing phase occurs before hitting the ground. For robotic payloads larger than the Curiosity rover, larger parachutes will be required. These parachutes need to be tested under the low-density supersonic conditions that match Mars conditions. However understanding the shape history, dynamics, and induced stresses in the parachute structure and broadcloth during the inflation event is needed to ensure that minimum strength margin requirements are met. Further understanding the strength capability of materials under bi-axial and shear stress is essential. The measured material capabilities and stress conditions during inflation will be matched with computer models that will eventually be used as predictive tools in the parachute design process. This SBIR asks for help inventing and utilizing techniques for measuring parachute materials strength capabilities under flight-like loading conditions, and measuring, or inferring, parachute material stress and shape histories found during the inflation process during supersonic parachute inflation testing planned for the 2018 timeframe. Parachute Materials Testing Low mass, high strength parachute fabrics typically are constructed using various woven low mass Dacron or nylon broadcloth (e.g., 1.2 oz./yd2) that are sewn as gores onto Kevlar (or other high strength) webbing that forms a circumferential and radial skeleton primary structure. These materials as well as associated seams and joints are typically strength tested uni-axially. In some cases bi-axial testing has occurred however test fixtures and test facilities that attempt to reproduce the bi-axial and shear-induced stresses and strain associated with the dynamic inflation event do not appear to exist. Proposers to this subtopic should suggest ideas and provide the capability for determining the strength of these classes of materials including joints and seams under various bi-axial stress and shear conditions (materials, sample joints and seams will be provided) that are representative of the manner in which the materials are loading during and after inflation. Phase I will be expected to deliver: Measurement detailed design (and design review), Details of material test requirements (to be worked with the lead center in this phase), Implementation and cost plan, and Test facility and calibration plan Phase II will be expected to deliver: Tested and calibrated material test instrumentation and/or facility, Material testing (using samples provided by parachute manufacturers), Test data analysis and results. In-situ Instrumentation Ultimately, to prove that sufficient strength margin exists in the parachute design we need to determine the stresses or strains of the materials, seams and joints during the supersonic inflation event(s). Computer models that attempt to predict these stresses have not been validated due to an absence of data to ground the simulation results. NASA may execute supersonic, high-altitude inflation testing using various sized DGB parachutes in the 2018 timeframe. Plans include the use of high-speed stereo machine vision cameras that will allow shape history reconstruction of the very fast (< 1 sec) inflation event. Load cells on the riser(s) will provide estimates of the integrated tension during the event. After the test, the parachute and its instrumentation will be recovered and data extracted to gain understanding of the event. Some strain might be observable. What is missing are means to more directly measure or infer the peak stresses in the skeleton and broadcloth during the inflation event. Creative solutions have been proposed in the past, to instrument the parachute directly but these suffer from immaturity, use unproven integration techniques, and/or have questionable accuracies. These past solutions include: stress paint, strain threads that act as peak strain telltales, ultra-low-mass miniature self-contained strain gauges, and passive peak stress detection sewn into the circumferential and radial skeleton webbing (ball-strain yielding). These and other ideas are encouraged. Proposers should suggest and have the ability to deliver various types of in-situ or remote instrumentation. Care should be taken to ensure that the incorporation of these devices do not excessively interfere with the operation of the parachute during the mortar-launched parachute inflation. Phase I will be expected to deliver: Detailed design concepts, Implementation and cost plan, Details of accommodation (to be worked with the lead NASA center), and Instrument test and calibration plan. Phase II will be expected to deliver: Tested and calibrated instrumentation, System test support (use of instrument in a ground or flight test), and Instrument data analysis. Read less>>"

The weave thickness should be ~0.1 inches with a finished skirt diameter in the 1-3 meter range. Development of alternate 3D weave architectures that utilize multiple fiber types, including but not limited to non-ablating fibers on the outer mold line side that transition to structural and/or insulating fiber types.

The benefit to deployable decelerators is that relatively large atmospheric entry vehicles can be designed to fit within a comparatively small vehicle launch fairing. Deployable decelerator technology will enable delivery of an estimated 20 metric tons of payload required to support human exploration of Mars, and will also enable return of large payloads from Low Earth Orbit as well as launch asset recovery for reduced cost of space access. For Mars human exploration it is estimated that a deployable may have a diameter of 18 meters which, for an inflatable system, will require over 100 cubic meters of hydrogen gas at a weight of nearly 700 kilograms. This subtopic area solicits innovative technology solutions applicable to deployable entry vehicles. Specific technology areas included in the subtopic can include the development of gas generator technologies used as inflation systems that result in improved mass efficiency and system complexity over current pressurized cold gas systems. Inflation gas technologies can include warm or hot gas generators, sublimating powder systems, or hybrid systems. Proposed approaches should clearly demonstrate that the inflation technology can be scaled to inflated aero-shells at a size relevant to human scale Mars exploration missions.

The approach of this subtopic is to seek novel software and hardware technologies that provide notable benefits to NASA's supercomputing users and facilities, and to infuse these technologies into NASA supercomputing operations. Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, NASA's high-end computing (HEC) projects - the High End Computing Capability project at Ames and the Scientific Computing project at Goddard. To assure maximum relevance to NASA, funded SBIR contracts under this subtopic should engage in direct interactions with one or both HEC projects, and with key HEC users where appropriate. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and NASA relevance during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration. Offerors should demonstrate awareness of the state-of-the-art of their proposed technology, and should leverage existing commercial capabilities and research efforts where appropriate. Open source software and open standards are strongly preferred. Note that the NASA supercomputing environment is characterized by: HEC systems operating behind a firewall to meet strict IT security requirements. Communication-intensive applications. Massive computations requiring high concurrency. Complex computational workflows and immense datasets. The need to support hundreds of complex application codes - many of which are frequently updated by the user/developer. Projects need not benefit all NASA HEC users or application codes, but demonstrating applicability to an important NASA discipline, or even a key NASA application code, could provide significant value. For instance, a GPU accelerated (or multi-core) planetary accretion code such as LIPAD (Lagrangian Integrator for Planetary Accretion and Dynamics). The three main technology areas of S5.01 are aligned with three objectives of NSCI, the National Strategic Computing Initiative, announced by the White House in July 2015.

This area seeks technologies to accelerate the development of an efficient and practical exascale computing system (1018 operations per second). Innovative file systems that leverage node memory and a new exascale operating system geared toward NASA applications are two possible technologies for this element. At the same time, this area calls for technology to support co-design (i.e., concurrent design) of NASA applications and exascale supercomputers, enabling application scaling to billion-fold parallelism while dramatically increasing memory access efficiency. This supports NSCI Objective 1 (Accelerating delivery of a capable exascale computing system that integrates hardware and software capability to deliver approximately 100 times the performance of current 10 petaflop systems across a range of applications representing government needs.). Data analytics is becoming a bigger part of the supercomputing workload, as computed and measured data expand dramatically, and the need grows to rapidly utilize and understand that data. This area calls for technologies that support convergence of computing systems optimized for modeling & simulation and those optimized for data analytics (e.g., data assimilation, data compression, image analysis, machine learning, visualization, and data mining). In-situ data analytics that can run in-memory side-by-side with the model run is another possible technology for this element. This supports NSCI Objective 2 (Increasing coherence between the technology base used for modeling and simulation and that used for data analytic computing.). Presently it is difficult to integrate cyberinfrastructure elements (supercomputing system, data stores, distributed teams, instruments, mobile devices, etc.) into an efficient and productive science environment. This area seeks technologies to make elements of the supercomputing ecosystem much more accessible and composable, while maintaining security. Thus supports NSCI Objective 4 (Increasing the capacity and capability of an enduring national HPC ecosystem by employing a holistic approach that addresses relevant factors such as networking technology, workflow, downward scaling, foundational algorithms and software, accessibility, and workforce development.).

Enable disciplined system analysis for the design of future missions, including modeling of decision support for those missions and integrated models of technical and programmatic aspects of future missions. Such models might also be made useful to evaluate technology alternatives and impacts, science valuation methods, and programmatic and/or architectural trades. Specific areas of interest are listed below. Proposers are encouraged to address more than one of these areas with an approach that emphasizes integration with others on the list: Conceptual phase modeling and tools that assist design teams to develop, populate, and visualize very broad, multidimensional trade spaces; methods for characterizing and selecting optimum candidates from those trade spaces, particularly at the architectural level. There is specific interest in models that are able to easily compare architectural variants of systems. Capabilities to rapidly and collaboratively generate models of function or behavior of complex systems, at either the system or subsystem level. Such models should be capable of eliciting robust estimates of system performance given appropriate environments and activity timelines, and should be tailored: To support design efforts at the conceptual and preliminary design phases, while being compatible with transition to later phases. To operate within highly distributed, collaborative design environments, where models and/or infrastructure that support/encourage designers are geographically separated (including Open Innovation environments). This includes considerations associated with near-real-time (concurrent?) collaboration processes and associated model integration and configuration management practices.

Ideally, models should have the ability to quickly adjust fidelity to match the requirements of the simulation (e.g., from broad-and-shallow to in-depth). Processes, tools, and infrastructure to support modeling-as-design paradigms enabled by emerging model-based engineering (MBE) capabilities. MBE approaches allow a paradigm shift whereby integrated modeling becomes the inherent and explicit act of design, rather than a post hoc effort to represent designs converged using traditional methods. Modeling-as-design processes will first instantiate changes and/or refinements to models at all relevant levels, accompanied by frequent simulations that drive the integrated models to elicit performance of the system being designed. Target models (e.g., phenomenological or geophysical models) that represent planetary surfaces, interiors, atmospheres, etc. and associated tools and methods that allow them to be integrated into system design models and processes such that instrument responses can be simulated and used to influence design.

Since this process is not dependent on buoyancy driven convection to achieve material consolidation, it is highly functional in the microgravity environment and no microgravity effects on material outcomes have been observed to date. To expand material capabilities and impart an ability to produce high-strength, precision components on-orbit, candidate metal manufacturing technologies are currently being investigated for adaptation to microgravity. This part of the subtopic seeks to develop concepts for innovative manufacturing technologies for on-demand production of precision parts in the microgravity environment. For example, an innovative manufacturing solution could be a hybrid system that consists of an additive manufacturing process that can produce near-net shape parts and a traditional subtractive process that finishes the parts to the desired net shape. The quality of fabricated parts (dimensional accuracy, surface finish, etc.) should be comparable to what is achievable by a commercial off the shelf CNC machine. This subtopic seeks innovative technologies in the following areas for in-space use: Innovative on-demand manufacturing technologies and techniques adaptable for use in the microgravity environment (such as hybrid additive and subtractive systems or other novel manufacturing techniques). Systems that address microgravity considerations such as debris / cutting fluid management and control of feedstock are of special interest.

Many NASA programs baseline AM components in their design, however qualification efforts are complicated by the absence of industry-accepted standards and process controls. The near-term methodology for part quality assurance is to use pre-process and post-process measurements to show that a part design and as-built hardware meet the established requirements to safely and reliably complete the intended mission. This method relies heavily on the ability to non-destructively evaluate parts to identify process escapes resulting in flaws in the AM parts. For parts of complex geometry, which is often the motivation toward AM, post-build inspections can be limited. The long-term goal of part qualification is to ""qualify as you go."" This concept uses pre-process, in-process, and post-process measurements to demonstrate that a part will perform to requirements. Successful technology demonstration has the potential to reduce scrap rates, and the cost and quantity of post-build NDE required for part qualification. The principal desired outcome of this subtopic is to develop reliable in-process sensing and monitoring technologies for powder bed fusion (PBF) AM processes to aid in the quality of processes used to produce critical components for aerospace applications. Current AM PBF technologies run with limited or no process feedback; therefore, the ability to rely on process control alone is limited and the ability to non-destructively inspect AM parts is critical to the flight rationale for fracture critical components. The ability to augment AM process controls with verifiable feedback regarding process stability and part quality will significantly reduce the risk associated with complex AM parts that cannot be readily inspected with available non-destructive evaluation methods. The objective of the subtopic is to support activities that provide a foundation for practical application of AM sensing and monitoring technology in the aerospace sector, and also enable and stimulate development and innovation within the topic area. Supported activities will be based on long-term vision and the immediate needs of NASA programs and projects. Specific research objectives include: Sensing technologies for layer-by-layer quality confirmation. In-process monitoring and sensing to detect off-nominal process conditions or defects. In-process monitoring and sensing for melt pool characterization. Predictive modeling of system response to sensing-related process changes.

The impact on total cycle time and cost from CAD to final part should be assessed as part of the justification for the approach proposed. Linking process parameters to mechanical properties, microstructure, grain texture and grain size through empirical observations, real time process monitoring, or modeling. In-situ assessment or process monitoring of grain size, defect detection, build anomalies, and defect repair.

In the specialty materials processing area, the focus for this solicitation is on bulk metallic glasses (BMG) and BNNT reinforced MMCs. Specific areas of interest relate to optimized processing to fabricate these materials while retaining their unique microstructures and properties. Of specific interest for BNNT MMCs are innovative processing methods that: Achieve uniform distribution and alignment of BNNTs within the metal matrix. Minimize the formation of brittle phases at the “reinforcing agent / metal” interface. Product forms of interest include continuously- or discontinuously- reinforced nano-composites, and hybrid laminate materials. Improved processing may involve modifying incumbent methods such as powder metallurgy, melting/solidification, thermal spray, and electrochemical deposition or introduction of new method. The success of proposed processing improvements will be measured by increases in tensile strength achieved over existing alloys. Consequently, proposals must include characterization and testing of the fabricated materials. Of specific interest for BMGs are innovative processing methods for rapid prototyping of net shape bulk metallic glass components. Product forms of interest are uniformly thin walled structures and structures of high dimensional accuracy and precision (from nm to cm scales). Consideration must be given to the availability of BMG feedstocks or accommodating the raw materials for in-situ alloy fabrication.

Nominal overall size of the solar array ""farm"" is 2500 m2. Because of the critical nature of electrical power, this equipment may be prepositioned and validated prior to human landings. Modular solar array designs could be based on individual deployable structures with 50-150 m2 of area each. Another approach could be a single monolithic structure. Regardless of the configuration, autonomous deployment/assembly is assumed to be required. This subtopic seeks innovations in lightweight structures, robust deployment/retraction mechanisms, and autonomous assembly focusing on the process of post-landing deployment and erection of a large solar power system on the surface of Mars. Each lander might have its own modular power system that could be relocated closer to the loads to reduce cabling lengths and grow available power as the human Mars base grows. Design guidelines for these autonomously deployed Mars solar array structures are: 2500 m2 total solar cell area; < 5000 kg total mass including all mechanical and electrical components; and < 20 m3 total launch volume. Loads: 5 g axial, 2 g lateral, 145 dB OASPL for launch and 50 m/s Mars surface winds. Ideally > 1 g deployed strength to allow unconstrained Earth deployment qualification.

Lightweight, compact components including booms, ribs, substrates, and mechanisms. Optimized use of advanced ultra-lightweight materials (but not materials development). Validated modeling, analysis, and simulation techniques. High-fidelity, functioning laboratory models and test methods.

Of special interest are modular designs that are self-supporting in 1 g and can be autonomously deployed, retracted, relocated, and optionally interfaced with other power sources at least twice after months of operation on the Mars surface. Sharing of conceptual CAD models and analyses with NASA for mission studies, and delivery of prototype hardware to NASA at the end of Phase II for independent testing, are highly encouraged. In Phase I, contractors should prove the feasibility of proposed innovations using suitable analyses and tests. In Phase II, significant hardware or software capabilities that can be tested at NASA should be developed to advance their Technology Readiness Level (TRL).

This topic area seeks to develop advanced ground test technology components and system level ground test systems that enhance Chemical and Advanced Propulsion technology development and certification. The goal is to advanced propulsion ground test technologies to enhance environment simulation, minimize test program time, cost and risk and meet existing environmental and safety regulations.

Focus Area 16 Ground & Launch Processing,H10.02Improved Operations via Interface Design, KSC," AFRC, SSC", TA13 Ground and Launch Systems Processing, 2017,"This subtopic seeks to simplify prelaunch and surface operations through improved interface design concepts. Development and adoption of improved, standardized interfaces holds the potential of reducing the cost and complexity of future space systems and their related design and implementation, which can increase the funding available for additional flight hardware. NASA is interested in areas of interface technology that lower launch vehicle operations costs and provide evolution paths for in-space exploration. This includes interfaces between systems normally present within a launch system. For the purpose of this subtopic a launch system includes a vehicle ready for flight with payload, and includes all related support systems and infrastructure. A substantial portion of pre-launch processing involves the integration of spacecraft assemblies to each other or to the ground/surface systems that supply the commodities, power or data. Each assembly requires a reliable interface that connects it to the adjacent hardware which includes flight critical seals or connectors and other components. The benefits of standardized, simplified interfaces are particularly strong for small launch vehicles. Due to a lack of common specifications and standards, each launch vehicle system may impose different interface requirements thereby resulting in unique components/subsystems tailored for each vehicle. This complicates recent efforts to establish a multi-user capability within the existing launch infrastructure. For the launch provider, unique interface requirements result in higher recurring cost per launch vehicle and reduced ability to incorporate newer subsystems as the vehicle matures. Future activities at exploration destinations in space and on other surfaces will rely on a combination of structures and systems working together with a high degree of reliability. The impact of these interface-dependent tasks are of particular concern for surface systems where the additional work must be accomplished by crew performing Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs) or by purpose-built robotic systems. Areas of interface technology development relevant for surface operations may include (but are not limited to) cryogenics, modular systems, dust tolerance, standardized disconnects, and embedded intelligence. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II demonstration, and delivering a demonstration package for NASA testing in operational or analog test environments at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase I Deliverables - Research to identify and evaluate candidate technology applications, demonstrate the technical feasibility, and show a path towards a demonstration.

Focus Area 16 Ground & Launch Processing,H10.03Cryogenic Purge Gas Recovery and Reclamation, SSC," GRC, KSC", TA13 Ground and Launch Systems Processing, 2017,Helium is becoming a major issue for NASA and the country. Helium is used as a purge gas to reduce the concentration of hydrogen below the flammable threshold at test and launch complexes. Most of the Nation's helium comes from the National Helium Reserve operated by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The statutory authority for BLM to operate is expiring and responsibility is being transferred to the commercial sector. Helium is a non-renewable gas that is in limited supply. There are already helium supply constrictions and prices are going up. Conservation and/or reuse of this non-renewable resource would substantially reduce the cost of operating NASA's test and launch facilities. Specific areas of interest include the following technologies: Development of non-proton exchange helium/hydrogen gas separation technologies. Technologies for the rapid capture and safe storage of high volumes of mixed helium/hydrogen gas mixtures. Development of zero trapped gas system technologies to improve purge effectiveness. Development of sensor technologies that can validate that recycled gases meet stringent cleanliness levels of Table 2 of MSFC-STD-3535.Read less>>
Focus Area 17 Thermal Management Systems,S3.06Thermal Control Systems, GSFC," ARC, JPL, JSC, LaRC, MSFC", TA14 Thermal Management Systems, 2017,"Future Spacecraft and instruments for NASA's Science Mission Directorate will require increasingly sophisticated thermal control technology. Innovative proposals for the cross-cutting thermal control discipline are sought in the following areas: Advanced thermal devices capable of maintaining components within their specified temperature ranges are needed for future advanced spacecraft. Some examples are: Phase change systems with high thermal capacity and minimal structural mass. High performance, low cost insulation systems for diverse environments. High flux heat acquisition and transport devices. Thermal coatings with low absorptance, high emittance, and good electrical conductivity. Radiator heat rejection turndown devices (e.g., mini heat switches, mini louvers). Miniature pumped fluid loop systems with passive valve for radiator heat rejection turndown, and consumes minimal power. Current capillary heat transfer devices require tedious processes to insert the porous wick into the evaporator and to seal the wick ends for liquid and vapor separation. Advanced technology such as additive manufacturing is needed to simplify the processes and ensure good sealing at both ends of the wick. Additive manufacturing technology can also be used to produce integrated heat exchangers for pumped fluid loops in order to increase heat transfer performance while significantly reducing mass, labor and cost. Science missions are more dependent on optically sensitive instruments and systems, and effects of thermal distortion on the performance of the system are critical. Current Structural-Thermal-Optical (STOP) analysis has several codes that do some form of integrated analysis, but none that have the capability to analyze any optical system and do a full end-to-end analysis. An improvement of existing code is needed in order to yield software that can integrate with all commonly used programs at NASA for mechanical, structural, thermal and optical analysis. The software should be user-friendly, and allow full STOP analysis for performance predictions based on mechanical design, and structural/thermal material properties. Thermoelectric converts (TEC) have advantages of small size, long life, solid state design, and no moving parts or fluid operation, and have been used on many science instruments requiring dedicated/localized cooling to meet their stringent requirements. However, they have historically exhibited poor efficiency and have not been able to provide the cold temperatures needed by certain types of space science instruments. Research and development in areas of advanced materials, processes, and designs are needed in order to improve its efficiency, and extend its low temperature (<90K) capability for space science application. Water has been used in two-phase thermal control devices such as heat pipes due to its high heat transport capability. However, water has two main drawbacks that limit its use in many aerospace applications. Its expansion upon freezing creates a concern about rupture of the heat pipe and the concern for reliable startup from an initially frozen state. Water-containing azeotropes, which behave as a single-component working fluid, can offer substantial benefits as alternatives to use of pure water for applications where freeze/thaw and frozen startup concerns exist. High-performance water azeotropes which can lower the freezing point of water below -40°C while providing improved reliability for aerospace thermal control systems are needed. Three-dimensional (3D) integrated circuits (ICs) offer unprecedented functionality and efficiency in small form factors, but their operation is constrained by the current remote cooling paradigm that relies on conduction and heat spreading across multiple interfaces. An embedded approach, which facilitates in-situ cooling of the chip stack is needed. Such a cooling device must also accommodate high heat fluxes and minimize the thermal resistance between the heat source and sink. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II hardware demonstration. Phase II should deliver a demonstration unit for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.

Focus Area 17 Thermal Management Systems,Z2.01Thermal Management, JSC," GRC, GSFC, JPL, MSFC", TA14 Thermal Management Systems, 2017,"Exploration Vehicle Thermal Systems Variable Heat Rejection Technologies Exploration vehicles require variable heat rejection due to the potential to operate in environments ranging from full sun on one side to a cold deep space environment, while rejecting a range of waste heat loads. NASA Technology Roadmap Area 14 identifies a turn down goal of 6 to 1 for a thermal control system. Room temperature thermal control systems are sought that are sized for nominal operation in full sun exposure, yet are able to maintain set point control and stable operation at one-sixth of their design heat load when in a deep space (0°K) environment. Solutions for variable heat rejection may include novel architectures, novel thermal control fluids, advanced radiator technologies, and/or variable working fluid/radiator conductance. Radiator-based technologies should have an areal mass no greater than 5.8 kg/m2. Advanced-Closed Loop Extravehicular Activity Thermal Control NASA continues to evolve space suit technology for exploration missions; however, the portable life support system (PLSS) includes a water evaporator to reject waste energy produced by the suit. Closed-loop, non-venting thermal heat rejection systems that are capable of rejecting heat in the Martian atmosphere are needed to create a PLSS that minimizes consumable use and does not impact the Mars environment. NASA seeks novel approaches to close the thermal control system of the space suit, targeting 80% or greater reductions in evaporated water mass for the same heat rejection. However, the mass and volume of the system must be limited as it must be carried on the crewmember's back. Approaches may include novel radiative approaches and/or desiccant systems to reclaim evaporants, as well as other novel solutions. Examples of such technologies and goals are outlined in NASA's Technology Roadmap Area 06, but more innovative concepts are also sought. Advanced Heat Exchangers and Coldplates Air/liquid heat exchangers (HXs), liquid/liquid HXs, and coldplates are at the core of any active thermal control system for a space vehicle. While these individual components are small, they are found throughout spacecraft vehicles and their cumulative mass and volume is significant. Advances in materials or manufacturing may yield a considerable mass savings over the current state of the art heat exchangers. NASA's Technology Roadmap Area 14 details various points of interest for these heat exchangers, and key goals are listed below: Corrosion resistant coldplates with less than the state of the art 8.8 kg/m2 mass per area. Heat exchangers with minimal structural mass and good thermal performance to reduce mass below 2 kg/kW of heat transfer, assuming delta-T on the order of 5°C. Condensing heat exchangers (air/liquid heat exchangers) for closed loop life support, achieving highly reliable 3-year minimum lifetime, not contaminated by microbial growth, and whose coatings do not impact the life support system's water recovery system. High Lift Heat Pumping Devices Heat pumps are needed to reject spacecraft waste heat to a higher temperature sink. At lunar equatorial locations, lunar surface temperatures can climb to 400°K, making it difficult to reject waste heat at nominal temperatures. A more severe application involves rejecting waste heat for a Venus lander where environmental sink temperatures can exceed 700°K. Ground-based designs that do not rely on gravity for elements of heat pump operation, such as lubricant management, contaminant control, or phase separation, are a reasonable starting point for a high lift heat pump device for extreme environment applications. However, these designs must be adapted or proven to work in space applications. Intermittent operation in microgravity, low gravity, and/or in severe environments, such as hard vacuum, radiation, and extreme temperatures, are significant challenges to viable space-based heat pumps. NASA seeks targeted improvements for space-based heat pump technology, which may include exceptionally long life, low mass, and operation with high temperature lifts (50°C or more) and a coefficient of performance at least at 30% of Carnot efficiency. Thermal Insulation for Pressurized Environments To enable longer duration missions to the surface of Venus, advanced insulation systems are required. External insulation on a Venus lander pressure vessel allows the system to take advantage of the thermal mass of the pressure vessel and reduce the heat transfer rate into the pressure vessel. The goal is to extend mission lifetime to collect and transmit more science data by allowing multiple communication passes with an orbiter. In addition to Venus in-situ explorers, this insulation can be used for future deep atmospheric probes for gas giant planets, or even in high temperature and pressure chemical processes in other systems. The current state-of-the-art in insulation systems considered for the Venus atmosphere are heavy, fragile and difficult to implement on the exterior of a pressure vessel. NASA seeks a lightweight, flexible insulation system that can be accommodated on the exterior of a pressure vessel. The insulation thermal conductivity should be less than 0.1 W/m-K at 470°C and 90 bar pressure in a carbon dioxide environment. Read less>>"
Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,A1.01Structural Efficiency-Tailored Airframe & Structures, LaRC, AFRC," TA12 Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems and Manufacturing", 2017,"A primary goal of structural efficiency is to reduce structural mass. Reduced mass has the direct benefit of fuel burn savings, and it also influences noise and emissions by enabling advances in airframe configurations and in propulsion. The state of the art for lightweight airframe structures are carbon fiber reinforced polymeric composite structures which make up approximately 50% of the weight of Boeing's 787. Further improvements in structural efficiency above the state of the art are possible with tailored materials and structures. Tailored materials can improve the mechanical properties that directly affect structural mass, can provide functional properties that eliminate systems that add parasitic mass (e.g., to accommodate thermal, electrical, acoustic loads), or both. Tailored structures can improve the structural efficiency of existing airframe configurations and can enable new, non-traditional airframes. The tailoring covered for this subtopic solicitation is intended to apply to fuselage structures, and is further focused on one or more of the following: Tailoring mechanical properties beyond the state of the art by taking advantage of newly available product forms and precision robotic fabrication such as to control composite ply thicknesses and orientations Tailoring mechanical and functional properties through “designer microstructures” such as alloys that enhance fatigue, polymer composites with advanced fibers and/or nanostructured constituents, or hybrid metal-composite laminates, where the additional functional capability eliminates a parasitic mass (e.g., lightning protection, cooling systems, acoustic dampening) Design and analysis codes that enable development of structural concepts that utilize the aforementioned tailored properties, product forms, and fabrication processes to developed fuselage structures for traditional tube-wing and for advanced configurations. For this subtopic, the Phase I proposal should identify an airframe component/application that would be the target of the tailored material and/or structural approach, should describe how the proposed approach would provide a significant improvement in structural efficiency over the state of the art, and should describe how the feasibility of the innovation to achieve this improvement will be demonstrated in a Phase I effort. The intention of a Phase II follow-on effort would be to develop or to further mature the necessary design/analysis codes, and to validate the approach though design, build, and test of an article representative of the component/application identified in Phase I.

Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,A1.04Aerodynamic Efficiency-Active Flow Control Actuators and Design Tools, LaRC, AFRC, TA15 Aeronautics, 2017,"NASA’s Aeronautical Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) has developed the Strategic Implementation Plan (SIP) that describes its research plan for advancing aeronautics research to meet the aviation industry’s demands over the next 25 years and beyond. One element of the plan focuses on developing ultra-efficient commercial vehicles. Improved vehicle efficiency will be achieved by reducing fuel burn and emissions. Active flow control (AFC) is a technology that has the potential to aid in achieving the efficiency goals of the next two generations of commercial vehicles. Active flow control is the on-demand addition of energy into a boundary layer for maintaining, recovering, or improving vehicle performance. AFC actuation methods have included steady mass transfer via suction or blowing, and unsteady perturbations created by zero net mass flux actuators, pulsed jets, and fluidic oscillators. Previous wind tunnel and flight tests demonstrated that this technology is capable of improving vehicle performance by reducing and/or eliminating separation and increasing circulation. When integrated into a transport aircraft, therefore, AFC would result in smaller control surfaces creating less drag and thereby less fuel consumption during flight. Widespread application of the technology on commercial transports, however, requires that AFC actuation systems be energy-efficient, reliant, and robust. Another challenging aspect of the design of the actuation system involves understanding how and where to integrate the actuator into the vehicle. Computational tool development is needed, in parallel with actuator development, to enable a more synergistic approach to active flow control system design thus maximizing the potential benefits of an AFC system. This solicitation is for innovative AFC actuator concepts and design tools, applicable to subsonic transports and/or civil aircraft that incorporate vertical lift capability, that take advantage of reduced order models to develop AFC actuators and AFC actuation systems that will aid in advancing AFC technology.Areas of specific interest where research is solicited include but are not limited to the following: Development of simple, low-cost, and efficient tools for modeling AFC actuator performance. Development of design tools for optimizing AFC actuator system integration. Development of actuator concepts capable of controlling separation due to large adverse pressure gradients or shock/boundary layer interactions.

Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,A1.05Computational Methods & Tools - High Fidelity Mesh and Geometry Tools, LaRC," AFRC, GRC", TA15 Aeronautics, 2017,"During 2012-2014, NASA sponsored a study aimed at determining future directions for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) research that would subsequently enable significant advancements in aeronautics. This study (CFD 2030 Study: A Path to Revolutionary Computational Aerosciences (http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140003093.pdf), noted many shortcomings in the existing technologies used for conducting high-fidelity simulations, and made specific recommendations for investments necessary to overcome these challenges. Chief among the recommendations was the need for robust higher-order discretization schemes, scalable solvers on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms, and adaptive h-p mesh refinement. It was recognized that the generation of meshes suitable for high-accuracy CFD simulations constitutes a principal bottleneck in the simulation workflow process as it requires significant human intervention. Similarly, providing access to the underlying geometry definition, as needed for both high-order simulations and adaptive gridding, is currently not available and is a further roadblock to the ubiquitous use of these technologies. In the area of geometry definition, a critical need arises from the fact that laser scans of the aircraft surfaces are often used to generate computer aided design (CAD) files. This often leads to surface geometries with unphysical surface waviness as part of the surface fitting process of the laser scan point clouds resulting in poor CFD meshes and, hence, erroneous CFD solutions. Also, in some cases the CAD geometry is only represented as a tessellated surface while continuous and differentiable surfaces are needed for meshes that would yield accurate solutions and accurate mesh refinement results. A tool that could remove unphysical surface waviness as well as fit tessellated CAD surfaces and output a continuous and watertight spline surface is needed for practical applications. To enable accurate CFD solutions, proposals are solicited in two areas: To develop robust means for generating meshes suitable for high-order accurate flow solvers, that can be demonstrated not to compromise the accuracy of the simulations. The three-dimensional unstructured grid tool developed during this research effort should be capable of creating mixed-element meshes. In conjunction with these meshes, geometry information must be easily accessible in a heterogeneous distributed computing environment through well-defined, yet lightweight, Application Programming Interface (API). To develop a CAD tool that could generate high-quality, continuously splined surfaces free of unphysical waviness and tessellated faces. The new capability will be demonstrated for configurations of interest to NASA aeronautics (http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/programs.htm) in terms of accuracy, speed and robustness. The proposers must present a convincing case that the proposed approach has the potential of meeting these metrics. Phase I research is expected to develop the technology and demonstrate it on relatively simpler configurations, while Phase II will increase the technology readiness level and include demonstration on more complex configurations. Note: This subtopic is focused on addressing high fidelity meshes and geometry tools as they relate to large scale, complex fluid dynamics simulations.

The use of small UAVs for commercial operations is rapidly increasing, and the rapid pace of technology advancements in electric and hybrid-electric power and autonomy systems expands the range of commercial missions that these vehicles are performing. With increased vehicle use there will be challenges self-monitoring performance and health status to efficiently maintain these vehicles, while detecting faults and degradations before they impact mission performance or cause the loss of the vehicle or payload. In addition, there will be trade-offs in vehicle operation between maximizing mission and propulsion system performance, while minimizing the environmental impact and annoyance from noise. These trade-offs will have to be taken into account within the vehicle health management system for mission planning and execution, given that the trade-offs may be different for different parts of a mission.

Responding to this call will require a proposal describing the intent to conduct novel research in materials and structures that is linked to enhancing aircraft propulsion efficiency. Reductions in vehicle weight, fuel consumption and increased component durability/life will increase propulsion efficiency. The extreme temperature and environmental stability requirements of advanced aircraft propulsion systems demand the development of new, reliable, higher performance materials. Research in the areas of high-temperature metals/alloys and ceramics and polymers (and their composites) provides fundamental understanding of the underlying process-structure-property relationships of these materials. Study of the interactions of material systems with harsh environmental conditions and the modes of failure of these systems are of particular importance to developing more advanced materials for future aircraft propulsion systems, which will be operating at higher temperatures than today’s turbine engines. Heat transport, diffusion, oxidation and corrosion, deformation, creep, fatigue and fracture are among the complex phenomena that can occur in the component materials in the extreme environment of turbine engine propulsion systems.

Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,A1.08Aeronautics Ground Test and Measurements Technologies, LaRC, GRC, TA15 Aeronautics, 2017,"NASA's ground-based test facilities, which include low speed, transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic wind tunnels, hypersonic propulsion integration test facilities, air-breathing engine test facilities, and simulation and loads laboratories, play an integral role in the design, development, evaluation, and analysis of advanced aerospace technologies and vehicles. In addition to design databases, these facilities provide critical data and fundamental insight required to understand complex phenomena and support the advancement of computational tools for modeling and simulation. The primary objective of the Aeronautics Ground Test and Measurements Technologies subtopic is to develop innovative tools and technologies that can be applied in NASA’s ground-based test facilities to revolutionize wind tunnel testing and measurement capabilities and improve utilization and efficiency. For this solicitation, NASA seeks proposals for innovative research and development in the following areas:Wind Tunnel Calibration and Characterization - Capabilities for wind tunnel calibration and characterization are critical for overall enhancement of facilities and will play a critical role in achieving the CFD 2030 Vision [1]. Systems that can provide planar or volumetric measurements of flow quantities such as multi-component velocities, density, and pressure in the airflow upstream and downstream of test articles are required to quantify tunnel inflow and outflow conditions and specify boundary conditions for numerical simulations. NASA envisions using these systems in large test sections (6 feet wide by 6 feet high and larger) and desires the system design to include provisions for combining these data into the regular stream of test data provided by a given facility. Model Attitude and Position Monitoring - Measurements of wind tunnel model attitude and position (e.g., roll, pitch, yaw angles and spatial coordinates X, Y, Z relative to a defined origin and coordinate system) are critical but are often difficult to make due to packaging constraints and model orientations where gravity based sensors are not applicable. To address some of these limitations, optical and non-optical techniques are needed to provide real-time or near real-time measurements of model attitude at high data rates of 10 Hz and with sufficient accuracy (0.005± 0.0025 degrees in pitch 0.025±0.025 degrees in roll and yaw). The setup and calibration time required for these systems should be 4 hours or less to minimize the impact on tunnel operations. With regard to position monitoring, many NASA wind tunnel facilities conduct tests at elevated temperatures (above 300°F) or at extremely low temperatures (-250°F). Displacement measurement components used in actuator systems for setting hydraulic cylinder positions and other hardware used in test article support and positioning systems must operate routinely in these extreme environments. Innovative designs for sensors, position measurement and monitoring, and hardware solutions are desired to provide accurate and reliable performance at these extreme conditions. Technologies for Engine Simulators - The need to assess aerodynamic performance at higher system levels with respect to fuel-burn and noise has created a great demand for propulsion-airframe integration (PAI) testing. Currently, PAI tests can be quite expensive due to issues related to the integration of the system into the model, reliability, complexity of the calibration, and the high pressure air and/or power which must cross the force and moment balance. NASA seeks innovative propulsion simulation systems that are more compact and capable of accurately simulating the flow, speed, and volume of actual propulsion systems, including approach and landing conditions for the assessment of airframe noise. Hydraulic, pneumatic, electric, or hybrid approaches are solicited. NASA also seeks innovative measurement systems and techniques for monitoring and evaluating the performance of these propulsion simulation systems. Example measurement systems and techniques include, but are not limited to, simulators that permit the measurement of loads on individual blades for studies involving boundary layer ingestion, force and moment balances capable of transferring high pressure air and/or power across the balance and operating at high temperatures (up to 350°F), and wireless sensor networks that are self-powered, intelligent (e.g., self-organizing, sensor fusion], and capable of performing preprocessing at or near the sensor to reduce bandwidth requirements.

Future air vehicles, especially autonomous vehicles, must operate with a high degree of awareness of their own well-being, and possess the internal intelligence to provide warning and potentially take action in response to off-nominal states. A vehicle’s capability to independently assure safety may be the only recourse in some situations, and addresses the recurring issue of inappropriate crew response. Further, early warning of impending maintenance conditions reduces maintenance cost and vehicle down-time through improved vehicle availability and throughput. Understanding the vehicle state also has impact on vehicle performance, efficiency, and environmental impact.

While cold gas or pulsed plasma systems are targeted for small delta-v, Δv application, modules that can provide more demanding maneuvers still need development. Small spacecraft buses other than cubesats have more flexibility to accommodate systems with several thruster units to provide more attitude control and also large single axis maneuvers. Missions have demonstrated these technologies successfully and performance data gathered has paved the way for future modifications of the existing hardware in order to re-adapt the designs to satisfy demanding constraints.

Focus Area 21 Small Spacecraft Technologies,Z8.02Small Spacecraft Communication Systems, GRC," ARC, GSFC, JPL, JSC, LaRC, MSFC", TA5 Communication and Navigation, 2017,"Space communications is an enabling capability to conduct NASA missions. Communications systems should impose the least possible constraints on mission spacecraft in order to meet required performance. Innovations and novel approaches are sought to reduce the mass, power consumption, volume, and operational constraints in order to increase the total data return, advance the technology readiness level, and reduce the cost and risk of communications systems for small spacecraft (generally considered to be on the order of 180 kg or less). Small spacecraft communication systems must be increasingly robust, flexible and diverse to support a wide variety of stand-alone and interconnected missions used by NASA to conduct space science, Earth science and exploration of the universe. Communication system components need to be able to operate over a range of environmental conditions, such as those imposed by launch vehicles and operations in space with appropriate levels of radiation tolerance. Infusion of new technologies or best commercial standards and practices (e.g., DVB-S2 standard, CubeSat form factors) that can demonstrably improve performance and be applied or adapted for use in Government, non-Government or commercial networks is desirable. Proposals for innovations and advancements in technology readiness are sought in any of the following areas of small spacecraft communications systems: High-gain Antennas (HGAs) - Development of HGAs are sought across a broad range of technologies including but not limited to deployable parabolic or planar arrays, active electronically steered arrays, novel antenna steering/positioning subsystems, and others suitable for use in high data rate transmission to, from and among small spacecraft. Operations compatible with NASA’s space communications infrastructure1 and Government exclusive or Government/non-Government shared frequency spectrum allocations (e.g., 25.5-27.0 GHz) is required. However, applicability or adaptability of the HGA technologies to non-Government use spectrum is also desirable [See References for applicable Government frequency spectrum allocations in the near Earth and deep space regions]. Transceivers and Radios - This area includes but is not limited to: radio frequency (RF) transmitters; amplifiers; low noise receivers, full duplex frequency selectable RF front-ends, integrated Global Navigation Satellite Service (GNSS) receivers, software defined or reconfigurable radios, or integrated transceivers and radios for links to relay satellites or direct to ground stations. In addition to reductions in mass, power consumption, volume and cost, increases in power and bandwidth efficiency, operational flexibility and frequency select-ability are sought. Small spacecraft transceivers and radios must be compatible with the operations of NASA’s space communications infrastructure.1 [See References for applicable NASA near Earth and deep space infrastructure guidelines and specifications]. Network and Application Service Protocols - Standard Internet protocols don’t work well over communication links that are subject to the frequent, transient service outages and/or long signal propagation delays that are characteristic of space flight communications. Innovations or advancements are sought in software and hardware systems that implement NASA’s delay/disruption tolerant networking (DTN) standards to support scalable, robust mission communications for small spacecraft missions. Implementation of protocols to enable low-power application communications among clusters of small spacecraft are also invited (e.g., Constrained Application Protocols, CoAP) [See References for applicable NASA and commercial networking standards]. Optical Communications - One-way optical communications for direct data downlink from small spacecraft can provide a useful communications mode for NASA and non-government missions while avoiding some of the complications associated with a two-way optical link (i.e., requiring an uplink beacon). Technology advancements or system-level solutions (i.e., space and ground segment components) are sought that increase the data rate or availability of optical communications for small spacecraft, or reduce mission risk, complexity or cost. A typical approach to advance the technology readiness level (TRL) leading to future flight hardware/software demonstration of any of the small spacecraft communications technologies would include: Phase I - Identify, evaluate and develop candidate small spacecraft communications technologies that offer potential advantages over the state of the art, demonstrate their technical feasibility, and show a path towards a hardware/software infusion into practice. Bench-level or lab-environment level demonstrations or simulations are anticipated deliverables. The Phase I proposal should outline a path that shows how the technology can be developed into space-qualifiable and commercially available small spacecraft communications systems through Phase II efforts and beyond.

These missions require reliable operation for several years in potentially harsh radiation environments. Industry has developed numerous cubesat components, but they lack the robustness needed for long duration missions. To address this capability gap, this subtopic will develop high reliability smallsat power generation and storage and thermal control systems that meet the performance and resource requirements of upcoming missions, while maximizing flexibility. An emphasis should be considered for energy management systems that combine power generation, storage and heat rejection in the compact cubesat platform as well as systems that enable electric propulsion. The development of advanced power generation and energy storage technologies are critical to enabling and expanding the use of future small satellite missions. Proposed research may focus on the development of new power generation and storage technologies, with particular interest in technologies that are approaching readiness for spaceflight testing. This subtopic solicits the development of modular, highly-reliable solar array, battery, power system electronics technologies that enable scalable smallsat and cubesat power systems with the following specifications: Solar array input power ranging from 15 W to 100 W. Battery capacity ranging from 5 Amp-hours to 20 Amp-hours (volume dependent). Provides from 12 to 20 switched power services to users, with output voltages configurable to meet mission-specific requirements. Maximum board size of 90 mm x 90 mm for power system electronics. Configurable via I2C, SPI, or CAN bus interface. Simple/modular power component designs (“plug and play”). Supports body mounted or deployed solar arrays. Supports power system reset initiated by external command (typically received from radio). Tolerant of extreme thermal and/or radiation environments. Ability to be stored in space for several years prior to use. Novel and/or integrated power with other subsystems (i.e., power and communications, energy storage and satellite structure, combined power/propulsion subsystems, etc.). Integration of the power and thermal subsystems is a synergistic combination that can result in mission-enabling resource savings. For example, batteries often carry the most restrictive temperature range of all spacecraft hardware, which can drive the thermal design. An integrated heat transfer turn-down device that helps to regulate temperature in extreme environments is a technology sought in this solicitation. Examples include miniaturized heat switches and lightweight thermal capacitance devices that are integrated into the battery assembly, each being scalable and tunable to a specific mission’s requirements. Deployable solar array systems are associated with higher waste heat dissipations, which in turn leads to higher volumetric heat fluxes for the small spacecraft. With limited area for suitable radiator placement, deployed radiator systems will also become necessary. Combining the radiator with the solar array will reduce the need for another deployment while also taking advantage of the environmental views. Technologies are sought to provide efficient heat transfer across the deployment mechanism. Thin radiator assemblies are needed to minimize increases in solar array thickness while also providing thermal isolation from the side with solar cells. Radiator concepts can be passive (e.g., solid-state material or heat pipes) or active (e.g., integrated fluid tubing is assumed to interface with a spacecraft-provided pumped loop). Integrating high thermal conductivity pathways from high heat flux power electronics components to chassis interfaces can provide incremental reductions in radiator sizes. Order of magnitude improvements over copper thermal ground plane/card-lock technologies are sought. In Phase I, contractors should prove the feasibility of proposed innovations using suitable analyses and tests. In Phase II, significant hardware or software capabilities that can be tested at NASA should be developed to advance their Technology Readiness Level (TRL). TRLs at the end of Phase II of 3-4 or higher are desired. NASA’s Small Spacecraft Technology Program will consider promising SBIR technologies for spaceflight demonstration missions and seek partnerships to accelerate spaceflight testing and commercial infusion.

Focus Area 21 Small Spacecraft Technologies,"Z8.04Small Spacecraft Structures, Mechanisms, and Manufacturing", ARC," GSFC, JPL, LaRC, MSFC"," TA12 Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems and Manufacturing", 2017,"Smallsats, including cubesats, are quickly maturing technologically towards advanced capabilities, which will result in significant contributions to the achievement of NASA’s scientific and exploration missions. In fact, smallsats are seriously being considered for complex, long duration missions to deep space locations and for Earth observing constellations. However, while smallsats have the benefit of small size and mass making them generally easier and cheaper to launch, many space applications require larger physical sizes or alternate structural architectures. These applications can be realized through the innovative blending of structural elements with other functional elements; reconfigurable, reusable structures; reliable deployment mechanisms and aggregation techniques; and novel manufacturing techniques driving the utility of smallsats even further. Three main thrust areas are envisioned for this subtopic. Structures In the area of smallsat structures, NASA is interested in materials and structural systems that optimize component or instrument packaging. This includes techniques to integrate or combine structural elements with other subsystem elements (multi-functionality; i.e., spacecraft chassis with electrical power management, or internal spacecraft communications). See related discussion below on Manufacturing on embedded systems into structures. Also of interest are technologies that can allow aggregation of smaller elements in space to create larger structures that cannot be launched as a single element, or that do not have to be designed to withstand launch loads. This implies integrative structural technologies that can share or distribute power, communications or thermal resources between the individual building blocks that can be arranged to perform a specific function in space. Further, these systems of building blocks can be reconfigured once launched to enable in space assembly architectures. Mechanisms This area focuses on the stowage (during launch) and deployment (during space operations) of various elements and subsystems. Included in this category are deployable solar cell arrays, radiators, antennas or other mission-enabling elements. These deployable mechanisms should be reliable in a wide variety of space environments (LEO and/or deep space) and be compatible with existing smallsat architectures. Ideally, deployable mechanisms should include methods to verify proper deployment (i.e., latch sensors, etc.) and should also employ robust technologies such as motorized actuators versus passive stored energy systems such as springs. Inflatable and on-orbit reconfigurable systems are also of interest. Manufacturing and Materials NASA is interested in technologies that take advantages of manufacturing advances as they apply to small spacecraft. Examples include model-based additive manufacturing technologies that can create fluid manifolds, propellant tanks, small thrusters, or unique geometries not currently possible via traditional manufacturing techniques. A related dimension to this area is multiple (or mass) production technologies that can be applied for the manufacturing of large numbers of spacecraft such as swarms or constellations. Other concepts involve integrating electrical components and interconnects within structural elements, especially when such integration results not only in mass savings, but also decreased integration and test flow timelines and increased overall systems reliability through the use of built-in-test approaches. Finally, NASA is interested in manufacturing technologies using novel materials that are low mass/density yet compatible with high radiation and extreme temperature deep space environments.

Focus Area 21 Small Spacecraft Technologies,Z9.01Small Launch Vehicle Technologies and Demonstrations, MSFC," KSC, LaRC", TA1 Launch Propulsion Systems, 2017,"As small spacecraft capabilities steadily expand the demand for low-cost dedicated launch capability is expected to grow and give rise to a viable small payload market segment. Servicing this market segment will likely require a variety of small launch vehicle capabilities to deliver payload masses ranging from 5-kg cubesats up to 180-kg ESPA-Class spacecraft. Orbital altitudes of interest range between 350 to 700 km with inclinations between 28 to 98.2 degrees to support CONUS operators and sun synchronous orbits at maximum altitude. Affordability objectives are focused on reducing launch costs below $60,000/kg with a goal of less than $20,000/kg. NASA is interested in fostering the small spacecraft commercial launch sector by investing in new technologies and innovations that are poised for rapid maturation and subsequent commercialization. It is recognized that a combination of multiple technologies and production practices will likely be needed, and it is highly desirable that disparate but complementary technologies formulate and adopt standardized interfaces to better allow for transition and integration into small spacecraft launch systems. Technologies of specific interest under this subtopic are as follow: Innovative Propulsion Technologies. Affordable Guidance, Navigation & Control. Manufacturing Innovations for Launch Vehicle Structures & Components. Proposers are expected to quantify improvements over relevant SOA technologies and substantiate the basis for investment. Potential opportunities for technology demonstration and commercialization should be identified along with associated technology gaps. Ideally, proposed technologies would be matured to TRL 5 or 6 by the end of Phase II effort. Technologies that can be developed and readied for flight-testing by the end of Phase II effort are of particular interest. A brief descriptive summary of desired technical objectives and goals are provided below. Innovative Propulsion Technologies Innovative chemical propulsion technologies and system concepts are sought that can serve as the foundational basis of an affordable ground-launch or air-launch system architecture. The scope of interest includes main propulsion systems and novel reaction control systems based on solid, liquid, or hybrid propellants. Technical approaches that address the critical challenges associated with downward scaling of launch vehicles are highly sought. Solutions that directly address staging sensitivities on deliverable payload mass, for instance, would be of keen interest. Design simplicity, reliability, and reduced development and recurring costs are all important factors. Proposers should explain how their technology works and provide a quantitative assessment of State-of-Art (SOA) in terms of key performance and/or cost metrics. The degree to which the proposed technology or concept is new, different, and important should also be made evident. Affordable Guidance, Navigation, & Control Affordable guidance, navigation & control (GN&C) is a critical enabling capability for achieving small launch vehicle performance and cost goals. Innovative GN&C technologies and concepts are therefore sought to reduce the significant costs associated with avionics hardware, software, sensors, and actuators. The scope of interest includes embedded computing systems, sensors, actuators, algorithms, as well as modeling & design tools. Low-cost commercially available components and miniaturized devices that can be repurposed as a basis for low-SWaP GN&C systems are of particular interest. Special needs include sensors that can function during prolonged periods of high-g and high-angular rate (i.e., spin-stabilized) flight, while meeting the stringent launch system environment requirements pertaining to stability and noise. A low-cost GPS receiver capable of maintaining lock, precision, and accuracy during ascent would be broadly beneficial, for example. Sensors that can withstand these conditions might be sourced from industrial and tactical applications, and performance requirements may be achievable by fusing multiple measurements, e.g., inertial and optical (sun, horizon) sensors. Modular actuator systems are also needed that can support de-spin and turn-over maneuvers during ascent. These can include cold-gas or yo-yo type mechanisms. Improved designs are needed to reduce the overall power and volume requirements of these types of actuator systems, while still providing enough physical force to achieve the desired maneuver and enable orbital insertion. Programmable sequencers are required to trigger actuators for events such as stage sequencing, yo-yo and shroud deployment. In addition to hardware, software algorithms for autonomous vehicle control are needed to support in-flight guidance and steering. Robust control laws and health management software are of interest, particularly those that address performance and reliability limitations of affordable hardware. This is especially important in the typical high dynamics (acceleration and angular velocity) conditions of proposed small launch vehicles. Algorithms that are able to merge data from redundant onboard sensors could improve reliability compared to expensive single-string sensors. Similarly, advanced ground-alignment, initialization, and state estimation routines that integrate noisy data are desired to support ascent flight. These algorithms take advantage of improved onboard computational capability in order to process observations from lower accuracy sensors to provide higher fidelity information. Implementations of state-of-the-art Unscented Kalman Filters, and Square-Root-Information Filters with robust noise and sensor models are particularly applicable. Successful technologies should eventually be tested in relevant environments and at relevant flight conditions. Potential testbeds include a variety of spacecraft and aircraft at a variety of scales. Capabilities include reduced gravity, suborbital reusable launch vehicles, high altitude balloons, subscale to ultra-high altitude aircraft, and in-flight simulation. Manufacturing Innovations for Launch Vehicle Structures & Components The development of more efficient vehicle structures and components are sought to improve small launch vehicle affordability. This may include the adoption and utilization of modern lightweight materials, advanced manufacturing inspired design innovations, or systems for actively alleviating launch loads and environments. Approaches for achieving life-cycle cost reductions might also include reduced part count by substitution of multifunctional components; additive and/or combined additive and subtractive manufacturing; repurposing launch structure for post-launch mission needs; incorporating design features that reduce operating costs; adoption of lean best practices for production and manufacturing; and shifting towards commercial practices and/or componentry. Alternatively, approaches based on the utilization of heavier materials could lead to simpler parts, fewer components, and more robust design margins. Although this could yield a larger rocket and impose performance penalties, significantly reduced life-cycle costs could be realized due to overall lower manufacturing and integration cost. Proposers should provide a quantitative assessment of State-of-Art (SOA) in terms of key performance and/or cost metrics. The degree to which the proposed technology or concept is new, different, and important should also be made evident. Read less>>"
Focus Area 22 International Space Station (ISS) Utilization,H8.01ISS Utilization and Microgravity Research, JSC," ARC, GRC, JPL, KSC, LaRC, MSFC", TA7 Human Exploration Destination Systems, 2017,"NASA continues to invest in the near- and mid-term development of highly-desirable systems and technologies that provide innovative ways to leverage existing ISS facilities for new scientific payloads and to provide on orbit analysis to enhance capabilities. Additionally, NASA is supporting commercial science, engineering, and technology to provide low earth orbit commercial opportunities utilizing the ISS. Utilization of the ISS is limited by available up-mass, down-mass, and crew time as well as by the capabilities of the interfaces and hardware already developed and in use. Innovative interfaces between existing hardware and systems, which are common to ground research, could facilitate both increased and faster payload development and subsequent utilization. Technologies that are portable and that can be matured rapidly for flight demonstration on the International Space Station are of particular interest. Desired capabilities that will continue to enhance improvements to existing ISS research and support hardware, with the potential of reducing crew time needs, and those that promote commercial enterprise ventures include but are not limited to, the below focus areas: Projects leading to the development of new research facilities and the enhancement of others in focus areas involving granular material research, material science for polymerization, soldiering, thermal diffusivity of organic liquids, particles suspension in plasma, and safe containment of samples while undergoing microscopy imaging. Additionally, projects that address enabling on-orbit capability for utilization of larger rodents for neuroscience research are of high interest. Technologies and flight projects that can enable significant terrestrial applications from microgravity development and lead to private sector and/or government agency product development within a number of discipline areas, including biotechnology, medical applications, material sciences, electronics, and pharmaceuticals. This includes modifications to existing flight instruments as well as the development of novel flight hardware for deployment on the ISS. Innovative software and hardware to facilitate enhanced station operations. The technology should increase the efficiency of crew operations by simplifying training and procedures, and provide teleoperation and tele-collaboration capabilities within the station, and between the station and ground operations. Instruments that can be used as inspection tools for locating and diagnosing material defects, leaks of fluids and gases, and abnormal heating or electrical circuits. The technology should be suitable for hand-held portable use. Battery powered wireless operation is desirable. Specific issues to be addressed include: pitting from micro-meteoroid impacts, stress fractures, leaking of cooling gases and liquids and detection of abnormal hot spots in power electronics and circuit boards. Mid-TRL space technology experiments are solicited to fly on a new space environmental effects platform on the outside of the ISS. The new platform is called MISSE-FF (MISSE-Flight Facility). MISSE-FF provides experiment accommodations for both active experiments (requires power and communications) and passive experiments. The technology can be materials or non-materials (devices). The physical size of the experiments can vary depending on the technology being demonstrated (1 inch by 1 inch up to 7.84 inches by 14 inches). Of special interest are space technologies already developed under the NASA SBIR Program, particularly technologies that would mature in TRL due to successful demonstration in the space environment. The proposal should justify the need for spaceflight exposure and justify that the ISS environment is adequate to gather the data they need. The MISSE-FF commercial partner, Alpha Space Test & Research Alliance, LLC, plans to service MISSE-FF every 6 months. The MISSE-FF data will be made available to the global community of researchers through the NASA Physical Sciences Informatics (PSI) system. Phase I deliverables could be data from ground testing the candidate technology and passive specimens for flight on MISSE-FF. Phase II deliverables could include an active technology experiment, packaged and ready for flight on MISSE-FF. For the above, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and prototype hardware development during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration and delivering an engineering development unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract that could be turned into a proof-of-concept system which can be demonstrated in flight.

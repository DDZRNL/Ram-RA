Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.01Aviation External Hazard Sensor Technologies, LaRC," AFRC, GRC","NASA is concerned with the prevention of encounters with hazardous in-flight conditions and the mitigation of their effects when they do occur. Hazardous flight conditions of particular interest are: wake vortices, clear-air turbulence, in-flight icing, lightning, and low visibility. NASA is interested in new and innovative methods for detection, identification, evaluation, and monitoring of in-flight hazards to aviation. In the case of lightning, interest is centered on the mitigation and in-flight measurement of lightning damage, particularly to composite aircraft.NASA seeks to foster research and development that leads to innovative new technologies and methods, or significant improvements in existing technologies, for in-flight hazard avoidance and mitigation. Technologies may take the form of tools, models, techniques, procedures, substantiated guidelines, prototypes, and devices. Proposed products may be for retrofit into current aircraft or for installation in future aircraft. Both manned and unmanned aircraft are of interest. A key objective of the NASA Aviation Safety Program is to support the research of technology, systems, and methods that will facilitate transformation of the National Airspace System to Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) (information available at www.jpdo.gov(link is external)). The general approach to the development of airborne sensors for NextGen is to encourage the development of multi-use, adaptable, and effective sensors that will have a strong benefit to safety. The greatest impact will result from improved sensing capability in the terminal area, where higher density and more reliable operations are required for NextGen. Under this subtopic, proposals are invited that explore new and improved sensors and sensor systems for the detection and monitoring of hazards to aircraft before they are encountered. With regard to hazardous lightning conditions, the emphasis is not on remote detection, but rather on developing systems that make aircraft more robust in a lightning environment or provide in-flight damage assessment or other hazard mitigating benefits. The scope of this subtopic does not include human factors and focused development of human interfaces, including displays and alerts. Primary emphasis is on airborne applications, but in some cases the development of ground-based sensor technology may be supported. Approaches that use multiple sensors in combination to improve hazard detection and quantification of hazard levels are also of interest. Areas of particular interest to NASA at this time are described in more detail below. The list and details are provided as encouragement but are not intended to exclude other proposals that fit the scope of this subtopic. Turbulence and Wake Vortex Remote detection of kinetic air hazards - The class of hazards including wake vortices, turbulence, and other hazards associated with air motion is referred to as kinetic air hazards. Within this class, wakes and turbulence are the highest priorities; however, NASA is particularly interested in sensor systems that can detect multiple hazards and thus provide greater utility. For example, air data systems are at times disabled by icing, and a multi-function, multi-hazard sensor that includes a robust alternative air data source would be a great asset in such conditions. Airborne detection of wake vortices -Airborne detection of wake vortices is considered challenging due to the fact that detection must be possible in nearly all weather conditions, in order to be practical, and because of the size and nature of the phenomena. In particular, NASA is interested in the ability to detect and measure wake vortex hazards for arbitrary viewing angles. Airborne detection of turbulence -NASA has made a major investment in the development of new and enhanced technologies to enable detection of turbulence to improve aviation safety. Progress has been made in efforts to quantify hazard levels from convectively induced turbulence events and to make these quantitative assessments available to civil and commercial aviation. NASA is interested in expanding these prior efforts to take advantage of the newly developing turbulence monitoring technologies, particularly those focused on clear air turbulence (CAT). NASA welcomes proposals that explore the methods, algorithms and quantitative assessment of turbulence for the purpose of increasing aviation safety and augmenting currently available data in support of NextGen operations. Lightning Lightning Strike Protection - NASA is investigating means for mitigating damage to aircraft, with a particular interest in protecting composite aircraft. Currently, an electrically-conductive screen protects composite aircraft by functioning as a Faraday shield and is intended to confine lightning and electromagnetic effects to the outside or outermost skin of the aircraft. The lightning strike protection system, hereafter referred to as the LSP, is incorporated in the coatings, layers, and structure that comprise the skin of the aircraft. NASA is most interested in LSP solutions that will be cost effective and light-weight. Mitigation of lightning strike damage - NASA is seeking solutions that will provide better protection from lightning damage by directing attachment points or lightning currents to safe or less hazardous areas and by reducing the susceptibility of the aircraft to thermal or other damage due to strikes. In-flight lightning damage measurement and assessment - A typical commercial aircraft is struck by lightning about once per year. At this time, composite aircraft that are struck in-flight are inspected upon landing for a damage assessment. Such assessments may be time-consuming and difficult. Innovations that will provide a measurement or damage detection system in the LSP are solicited. The objective would be to achieve a capability to have damage detection and assessment capability in the aircraft that will provide immediate information to the flight crew after a lightning attachment.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.02Inflight Icing Hazard Mitigation Technology, GRC," AFRC, GRC","NASA is concerned with the prevention of encounters with hazardous in-flight conditions and the mitigation of their effects when they do occur. Under this subtopic, proposals are invited that explore new and dramatically improved technologies related to inflight airframe and engine icing hazards for manned and unmanned vehicles. Technologies of interest should address the detection, measurement, and/or the mitigation of the hazards of flight into supercooled liquid water clouds and flight into regions of high ice crystal density. With these emphases in mind, products and technologies that can be made affordable and capable of retrofit into the current aviation system and aircraft, as well as for use in the future are sought. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to: Non-destructive 3-D ice density measurements of ice accretions on wind tunnel wing models. NASA has a need for non-optical methods to digitize ice shapes with rough external surfaces and internal voids as can occur with accretions on highly swept wings for comparison to computational simulations. Current methods based upon scanning with line-of-sight, visible-spectrum digitization methods have been found inadequate for many of these very complex ice shapes. Remote and in-situ technologies that can accurately quantify the super-cooled liquid water environment in the volume surrounding an airport. Of primary interest are remote sensing technologies that can, by themselves or with other instruments, quantify the temperature, liquid water content, and cloud droplet size spectrum to allow the production of a 3-D icing hazard map of the terminal airspace. Low-cost, expendable in-situ instruments are also of interest for validating and calibrating these remotely sensed measurements. Read less>>"
Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.03Flight Deck Interface Technologies for NextGen, LaRC," AFRC, GRC","Public benefits derived from continued growth in the transport of passengers and cargo are dependent on the improvement of the intrinsic safety attributes of current and future air vehicles that will operate in NextGen. The Aviation Safety Program (AvSP) is addressing this challenge by conducting cutting-edge fundamental and applied research that will yield innovative algorithms, tools, concepts and technologies from the discipline level up to the subsystem and system level. As a part of the AvSP, the Vehicle System Safety Technology (VSST) Project has initiated a Technical Challenge (TC) toward the improvement of Crew Decision-Making and response in complex situations (CDM), in current-day and NextGen operations. To address this TC, NASA seeks innovative flight deck interface research and technology that address the following major topic areas: The flight crew's needs for situation awareness/information in current-day and emerging NextGen operations. Research and technology development focused on novel display technologies and display methods that allow for new means of NextGen information portrayal and creating visual and aural interface methods to provide hazard and aircraft state awareness and protection during terminal maneuvering area operations. The development of flight deck interface technologies that assure pilot awareness and appropriate engagement (balancing awareness and workload) in current-day and emerging NextGen operations. Research and technology development to proactively address the potential impact of changing roles and responsibilities between the Air Navigation Services Providers (ANSP) and pilots as well as between the human and automation, and the robustness of these interfaces when responding to unexpected events. Integrated information management systems that assure the information needed by flight crews to make critical decisions is complete and not misleading. Research and technology development to better manage flight deck information during NextGen ""Net-Centric"" operations without overloading or underwhelming the operators/users. Understanding demographics and proficiency that impact human (pilot) decision-making. Research and technology development which addresses emerging pilot demographics and pilot proficiency standards to improve pilot decision-making and interactions with other human and automation Read less>>"
Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.04Vehicle Level Diagnostics, LaRC," AFRC, ARC, GRC","This SBIR subtopic augments on-going activities in the Vehicle Systems Safety Technology (VSST) project within NASA's Aviation Safety Program. Specifically, this subtopic addresses the ""Maintain Vehicle Safety between Major Inspections"" (MVS) technical challenge. The MVS technical challenge concentrates on capabilities to maintain vehicle safety between major inspection intervals with an emphasis on the subsystems of airframe, avionics, and propulsion. NASA is seeking proposals to combine information from, and within, the various subsystems to perform overall vehicle level diagnostics. The objective of this work is to provide an infrastructure to assess the health state of aircraft though the integration of full vehicle sensors and diagnostic information. Partnering with organizations that can provide relevant data is encouraged. Read less>>"
Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.05Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, ARC," AFRC, ARC, GRC","The fulfillment of the SSAT project's goal requires the ability to transform vast amounts of data produced by aircraft and associated systems and people into actionable knowledge that will aid in detection, causal analysis, and prediction at levels ranging from the aircraft-level, to the fleet-level, and ultimately to the level of the national airspace. For this topic, we are especially interested in automated discovery of previously unknown precursors to aviation safety incidents involving human - automation interaction. We expect to gain knowledge on latent deficiencies in crew training, communication, and operations that is of paramount importance to future SSAT project goals and objectives. The incorporation of human performance will be invaluable to the success of this effort, and as such it will be important to use heterogeneous data from varied sources that are matched on a per-flight basis with flight-recorded data, such as radar track data, airport information, weather data, flight crew schedule information, maintenance information, and Air Safety Reports. This topic will develop revolutionary and first-of-a-kind methods and tools that incorporate the limitations of human performance throughout the design lifecycle of human-automation systems to increase safety and reduce validation costs in NextGen. The focus of this effort will be on the fleet level or above. As such, the successful proposal will develop validated data mining and machine learning based methods to uncover systemic human-automation interaction issues that manifest at a much broader level than those incidents that occur within a single flight or for a single aircraft. Simulated data that is representative of the interactions between humans and automation found on flight systems and on data from real world aircraft and supporting ground-based systems should be used. The total of the data set under study should be at least 10 TB in size, and exhibit appropriate statistical and operational complexities found in real world human automation interactions. Furthermore, a deep knowledge of human-automation interaction from the human-factors perspective as well as the ability to create novel machine learning and data mining algorithms should be clearly demonstrated.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.06Assurance of Flight-Critical Systems, ARC, LaRC,"The purpose of this subtopic is to invest in mid- and long-term research to establish rigorous, systematic, scalable, and repeatable verification and validation methods for flight-critical systems, with a deliberate focus on safety for NextGen (http://www.jpdo.gov(link is external)). This subtopic targets NextGen safety activities and interests encompassing vehicles, vehicle systems, airspace, airspace concept of operations, and air traffic technologies, such as communication or guidance and navigation. Methods for assessing issues with technology, human performance and human-systems integration are all included in this sub-topic, nothing that multi-disciplinary research is required that does not focus on one type of component or phenomenon to the exclusion of other important drivers of safety. Proposals are sought for the development of: Safety-case methods and supporting technologies capable of analyzing the system-wide safety properties suitable for civil aviation vehicles and for complex concepts of operation involving airborne systems, ground systems, human operators and controllers. Technologies and mathematical models that enable rigorous, comprehensive analysis of novel integrated, and distributed, systems interacting through various mechanisms such as communication networks and human-automation and human-human interaction. Techniques, tools and policies to enable efficient and accurate analysis of safety aspects of software-intensive systems, ultimately reducing the cost of software V&V to the point where it no longer inhibits many safety innovations and NextGen developments. Tools and techniques that can facilitate the use of formal methods in V&V throughout the lifecycle such as graphical-based development environments (e.g., eclipse plug-ins for static analyzers, model checkers, or theorem provers) or tools facilitating translation from design formats used in industry to formal languages supporting automated reasoning. This subtopic is intended to address those flight-critical systems that directly conduct flight operations by controlling the aircraft, such as on-board avionics and flight deck systems, and safety-critical ground-based functions such as air traffic control and systems for communication, navigation and surveillance. It is not intended to cover V&V of computational models of physical systems (e.g., CFD codes or finite element analysis). In Phase II, a functional system shall be delivered to NASA for its retention and ownership. Read less>>"
Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Air Traffic Management Research and Development (ATM R&D) ,A2.01Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration into the National Airspace System Research, AFRC," ARC, GRC, LaRC","The following subtopic is in support of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Integration in the National Airspace System (NAS) Project under the Integrated Systems Research Program (ISRP). There is an increasing need to fly UAS in the NAS to perform missions of vital importance to National Security and Defense, Emergency Management, Science, and to enable commercial applications. The UAS Integration in the NAS Project is structured under the following technical challenges:Airspace Integration - validate technologies and procedures for UAS to remain an appropriate distance from other aircraft, and to safely and routinely interoperate with NAS and NextGen Air Traffic Services (ATS). Standards/Regulations - validate minimum system and operational performance standards and certification requirements and procedures for UAS to safely operate in the NAS. Relevant Test Environment - develop an adaptable, scalable, and schedulable relevant test environment for validating concepts and technologies for UAS to safely operate in the NAS. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations are built upon the condition of a pilot being in an aircraft.There exist few, if any, regulations specifically addressing UAS today. The primary user of UAS to date has been the military. The technologies and procedures to enable seamless operation and integration of UAS in the NAS need to be developed, validated, and employed by the FAA through rule making and policy development. The Project goal is to capitalize on NASA's unique capabilities and competencies by utilizing integrated system level tests in a relevant environment to eliminate or reduce critical technical barriers of integrating UAS into the NAS. The project is further broken down into five subprojects: Separation Assurance/Sense and Avoid Interoperability (SSI); Communications; Human Systems Integration; Certification; and Integrated Test and Evaluation. The fifth sub-project, Integrated Test and Evaluation, is responsible for developing a live, virtual, and constructive test environment for the other four subprojects. The first phase of the project includes the following:Conduct initial modeling, simulation, and flight testing. Complete early subproject-focused deliverables (spectrum requirements, comparative analysis of certification methodologies, etc.). Validate the key technical elements identified by this project.The second phase includes the following:Conduct systems-level, integrated testing of concepts and/or capabilities that address barriers to routine access to the NAS. Provide methodologies for development of airworthiness requirements and data to support development of certification standards and regulatory guidance. Develop a body of evidence (including validated data, algorithms, analysis, and recommendations) to support key decision makers in establishing policy, procedures, standards and regulations, enabling routine UAS access in the NAS. This solicitation seeks proposals, but is not limited, to develop: Certified control and non-payload communications (CNPC) system - Current civil UAS operations are significantly constrained by the lack of a standardized, certified control and non-payload communications (CNPC) system. The UAS CNPC system is to provide communications functions between the Unmanned Aircraft (UA) and the UA ground control station for such applications as: telecommands; non-payload telemetry; navigation aid data; air traffic control (ATC) voice relay; air traffic services (ATS) data relay; sense and avoid data relay; airborne weather radar data; and non-payload situational awareness video. New and innovative approaches to providing terrestrial and space-based high-bandwidth CNPC systems that are inexpensive, small, low latency, reliable, and secure offer opportunities for quantum jumps in UAS utility and capabilities. Of particular interest are: Technologies for High power C-band amplifiers and highly linear C-band power amplifiers/linearization of high power C-band amplifiers. Miniaturization of C-band radio components/systems.A Synthetic Vision System for a ground control station (GCS) - Integration of display technology that presents the visual environment external to the unmanned aircraft using computer-generated imagery in a manner analogous to how it would appear to the pilot in a manned aircraft. A synthetic vision system displays critical features of the environment external to the aircraft through a computer-generated image of the external scene topography using terrain and obstacle databases. Several research and technological developments have made synthetic vision systems possible. Fundamentally, these systems require only precise ownship location, a database, available graphics and computing capability and display media. In terms of safety benefits, synthetic vision may help to reduce many accident precursors including: Loss of awareness of vertical/ lateral path, terrain traffic, etc. Operational benefits may include transition from instruments to visual flight, non-normal and emergency situations, virtual visual self-spacing and station keeping capability, etc. SVS have been extensively studied and there is a vast body of knowledge on their application to manned aviation. Special interest is in the integration of a SVS into a UA ground control station to support operator in the loop, sense and avoid (SAA) functions for UAS operations in the NAS. Guidelines for sense and avoid requirements and functions are currently being developed by standards organizations (e.g., RTCA SC-203) and the FAA. Weather information systems for GCS - On-board, real-time graphic aviation weather information products have been developed and successfully implemented for manned cockpits. Their use is now widespread and their safety impact widely recognized. The applicability of such products for operators and ground control pilots to enhance situation awareness and improve mission planning and execution is of interest to NASA. Systems such as the NASA developed Aviation Weather Information (AWIN) system that included software, data and data-link applications, color weather graphics such as composite-radar mosaic, lightning-strike data, wind data, satellite images and forecasts could be integrated into a ground control station to provide pilots with weather awareness before and during mission execution. Improved weather awareness should allow aircrews to avoid most weather-related problems through both pre-flight and en-route planning. While the use of these systems has been explored for military UAS operations, their applicability to civil and public operations has not yet been explored. Operator Displays for Sense and Avoid Systems - While guidelines for the integration of UAS operations in the NAS are being developed new SAA systems are being designed to provide the ground control pilot with situation awareness and the ability to execute required ATC procedures. SAA systems provide UAS with the capability to avoid collisions and remain well clear of other aircraft by means of sensor systems and equipment specifically designed for this purpose. SAA systems consist of surveillance sensors, data communications, threat detection and/or resolution logic and the display of traffic information and/or resolution guidance/advice. Of interest is the development of display technologies to enable ground control pilots to participate in any phase of the SAA process as indicated by operator procedures. These new technologies should utilize the vast experience and body of knowledge developed over the years for airborne/ground separation assurance systems, TCAS displays, and cockpit displays of traffic information. In addition, these new displays will exhibit unique and very challenging new problems associated with the nature of unmanned systems as well as the communication latencies and potential safety risks of failure conditions. Human factors considerations should be applied in the design of these systems. Lost Communication Link Procedures and Operations - The procedures followed by unmanned aircraft and their pilots when the command and control link is lost with the ground station are not standardized and frequently do not take into account ATC regulations. Each UAS appears to have custom-designed procedures for ""lost link"" despite the existence of well-established rules for pilots to follow when communication capability is lost. Research should establish a desired set of procedures to be followed that parallel the existing requirements, but departing from those where necessary to meet critical safety considerations. These procedures may be codified in technologies used by the unmanned aircraft or the pilot in the ground control station to maximize the predictability of the UAS' actions from an ATC perspective. Safety Analysis and Methodologies - UAS operations are untried in the civil NAS. Unlike other aircraft, there is not an extensive record of civil operations upon which to forecast the safety of UAS operations in the NAS. The introduction of UAS into the NAS raises many safety issues and concerns. Typically, anytime a new capability is added into the NAS, an Operational Safety Assessment (OSA) is performed by the FAA, to determine whether that introduction of new capability will enhance or detract from the safety of the NAS. As these UAS represent a wholly new operational system, traditional approaches cannot suffice. Research is needed to identify and develop new safety analysis approaches, as well as prognostic indicators and potential new safety metrics. Read less>>"
Aeronautics Research,Topic A3 Air Vehicle Technologies ,A3.01Structural Efficiency - Airframe, LaRC," ARC, GRC, LaRC","Materials and Structural Concepts for Aeroelastically-Tailored Aircraft Wings The Fixed Wing and High Speed projects are focused on development of enabling technologies and advanced concepts for subsonic and supersonic cruise transport category aircraft, respectively, demonstrated to TRL 4-6 in the 2025 time frame. Both projects require simultaneous reduction of weight and drag to achieve their respective performance objectives. For subsonic transport aircraft, lift-induced drag is approximately 40% of the total drag at cruise and can be directly addressed via increased wing aspect ratio. For supersonic flight, speed requirements dictate highly swept wings with a very thin airfoil section. Both of these wing geometries, with higher aspect ratio or thinner airfoil section, result in more flexible structure that can exhibit aeroelastic instability and thus require more complicated aeroelastic design, analysis and control. The traditional solution to these aeroelastic issues has been primarily to stiffen the wing by adding additional structure, thus creating a weight penalty. Solutions that favorably modify the aeroelastic response of thin or high aspect ratio wings with no or little weight increase are needed. Furthermore, maneuverability of the vehicle is dependent upon the control authority achievable by wing-located control surfaces in traditional aircraft designs, and possibly actively tailorable portions of wings in more integrated aircraft designs. Designing the wing to have desired aeroelastic characteristics makes the wing amenable to minimal-input active control solutions to further modify the aeroelastic response. Using a building block approach in this research topic, the current solicitation focuses on materials and structural concepts for aeroelastically-tailored aircraft wings, while the more complex aeroservoelastic solution will be the subject of a future solicitation. This solicitation topic seeks innovative materials and/or structural concepts and technologies for lightweight wings with aeroelastic tailoring, such as tailored bending and torsional stiffness as an example. Proposals should involve novel materials, processes and structural concepts with significant potential to improve the structural efficiency and reduce specific weight. Laboratory scale approaches may be proposed for proof of concept, but must be scalable to application across a broad range of fixed wing aircraft sizes and speeds. Tailored stiffness may include spatial or temporal variations in stiffness achieved by a combination of passive stiffness tailoring of anisotropic or functionally graded materials, novel structural topologies, or active integrated elements to change structural and/or material properties. The use of existing design and analysis tools and techniques to the greatest extent possible is encouraged, as it is not the intent of this solicitation to develop new computational tools. Specifically, the following concepts and technologies are sought: Materials and processing routes to fabricate engineered materials with tailored material properties along all three axes. Aeroelastically-tailored structural concepts by which desired static or dynamic aeroelastic responses can be achieved. Phase I: Identify candidate material systems and structural concepts that enable aeroelastic tailoring of wing structure for reduced weight, for example, variable bending and torsional stiffness. Assess the feasibility and benefits of the proposed concept, including scale-up, necessary material property quantification, and design trade studies. The studies must include quantification of expected structural weight benefits. Identify limiting factors and recommendations for further technology development to address the shortfalls. For novel material systems and structural concepts requiring development, conduct initial proof of concept computational studies and/or element tests. Phase II: Perform scale-up of materials and processes as necessary, and produce a detailed structural design and hardware build of a subscale wing suitable for laboratory testing to assess structural performance of the concept. Structural testing of the subscale wing will be performed subsequently by NASA and is beyond the scope of the Phase II effort. Read less>>"
Aeronautics Research,Topic A3 Air Vehicle Technologies ,A3.02Quiet Performance, LaRC," ARC, GRC, LaRC","Innovative technologies and methods are necessary for the design and development of efficient, environmentally acceptable aircraft. In support of the Fundamental Aeronautics Program, improvements in noise prediction, measurement methods and control are needed for subsonic, transonic and supersonic vehicles targeted specifically at airframe noise sources and the interaction of airframe and engine noise. Innovations in the following specific areas are solicited: Fundamental and applied computational fluid dynamics techniques for aeroacoustic analysis, which can be adapted for design codes. Prediction of aerodynamic noise sources including those from airframe and sources which arise from significant interactions between airframe and propulsion systems. Prediction of sound propagation from the aircraft through a complex atmosphere to the ground. This should include interaction between noise sources and the airframe and its flow field. Innovative source identification techniques for airframe (e.g., landing gear, high lift systems) noise sources, including turbulence details related to flow-induced noise typical of separated flow regions, vortices, shear layers, etc. Concepts for active and passive control of aeroacoustic noise sources for conventional and advanced aircraft configurations, including adaptive flow control technologies, and noise control technology and methods that are enabled by advanced aircraft configurations, including integrated airframe-propulsion control methodologies.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A3 Air Vehicle Technologies ,A3.03Low Emissions/Clean Power, GRC," ARC, GRC, LaRC","Proposals are sought which support electric propulsion of transport aircraft, which includes various hybrid electric concepts, such as gas turbine engine-battery combinations and turboelectric propulsion (turbine prime mover with electric distribution of power to propulsors). Turboelectric propulsion for aircraft applications will require high specific power (hp/lb or kW/kg) and high efficiency components. Cryogenic and superconducting components will be required to achieve high specific power and high efficiency. The cryogenic components include fully superconducting generators and motors (i.e., superconducting stators as well as rotors), cryogenic inverters and active rectifiers, and cryocoolers. Proposals related to the superconducting machines may include aspects of the machines themselves as well as low AC loss superconducting materials for the stator windings. Generators with at least 10 MW capacity and motors of 2 to 3 MW capacity are of interest. Technology is sought that can contribute to superconducting machines with specific power more than 10 hp/lb. Superconducting wires with filaments less than 10 micrometers in diameter are of interest. Ideas are also sought for achieving 2-3X increase in specific power for non-cryogenic motors through a multidisciplinary approach utilizing advanced motor designs, better materials, and new structural concepts. Ideas are also sought to address challenges related to high voltage power transmission in future hybrid electric aircraft.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A3 Air Vehicle Technologies ,A3.04Aerodynamic Efficiency - Drag Reduction Technology, LaRC," ARC, GRC, LaRC","The challenge of energy-efficient flight has at its foundation aerodynamic efficiency, and at the foundation of aerodynamic efficiency is low drag. Drag can be broadly decomposed into four components: viscous or skin friction drag, lift-induced drag, wave or compressibility drag, and excrescence drag due to various protruding items such as antennae, wipers, lights, etc. The relative impact of these four forces depends upon the targeted flight regime and vehicle-specific design requirements. The first force, however, viscous skin friction, stands out as particularly significant across most classes of flight vehicles and effective measures for its control would have a major impact on flight efficiency. In particular, supersonic, low-boom flight and new generations of energy-efficient subsonic transport airplanes including high L/D strut-braced designs, the blended wing body (BWB), the so called ""double-bubble"" designs and other concepts with large expanses of surface area would benefit from effective viscous drag control. Viscous skin friction can be classified as either laminar or turbulent. While the laminar case and its attendant laminar flow control (LFC) techniques remain important scientific and technological disciplines, the goal of high Reynolds number flight efficiency requires that the turbulent case receive renewed attention. In place of the first-principles-derived theoretical framework of the laminar flow stability problem, in the turbulence case we have a wide collection of experimental observations, data correlations, various CFD approaches requiring turbulence closure models and, at low Reynolds numbers, full direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations (DNS). While such experimental and CFD-derived knowledge, has greatly increased our understanding of turbulent boundary layer physics over the past decades, key relationships between wall layer and outer layer dynamics essential to a full understanding remain to be identified and verified. Inadequacies in our understanding of boundary layer turbulence increase reliance upon a more qualitative, physics-guided approach to discovery. For example, the experimental observation of reduced skin friction in the corners of triangular cross-section pipes led to the discovery of drag-reducing V-groove riblets (subsequently also associated with the skin of certain shark species). The quasi-periodic, low-speed streak structures observed in the near-wall layer of turbulent boundary layers led to the implementation of mechanically controlled spanwise waves or lateral oscillations of the wall to disrupt the processes associated with low speed streak bursting. Similar observations have either been made or suggested with respect to the stabilizing influence of convex and in-plane curvature; long length-to-diameter ratio particulates; passive, active and reactive wall motion; manipulation of the wall layer by various geometrical devices (e.g., vortex generators (VG) and large eddy breakup devices (LEBU)), and various weakly ionized gas (WIG) and magnetohydrodynamic/electrohydrodynamic (MHD/EHD) concepts. This solicitation is offered in this spirit of innovation based on experimental or computational observations guided by a basic, though not necessarily complete, physical understanding of the turbulent processes. In order to stimulate innovation in the area of turbulent viscous drag reduction, proposals are sought subject to the following guidelines: Proposals shall address passive, active, or reactive concepts for external, attached, fully developed, turbulent boundary layer viscous drag reduction in air. Experimental, hardware-based proposals and theoretical/computational proposals based on realizable hardware are preferred. All practical physical concepts are acceptable including but not limited to: mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators, weakly-ionized-gas (WIG) concepts, laser/microwave energy deposition, MHD/EHD devices, surface microstructure/geometry, embedded mechanical devices (VG's, LEBU's), wall mass transpiration, heat transfer, wall motion, wall curvature effects and pressure gradient (vehicle shaping). Significant enhancements or refinements of existing concepts and technologies are acceptable. First order assessment or technically plausible discussion of any net system energy saving claims shall be provided. Proof-of-concept experimental demonstrations are encouraged for Phase I where applicable but are not required. Target conditions are flight-relevant Reynolds numbers at either high subsonic (0.7<M<0.9) or low supersonic (M<~ 3) speeds. Proposals at lower Mach and Reynolds numbers shall provide discussion of a developmental path towards flight-relevant conditions but not necessarily inclusive of actual flight. Read less>>"
Aeronautics Research,Topic A3 Air Vehicle Technologies ,A3.05Controls/Dynamics - Propulsion Systems, GRC, AFRC,"Propulsion controls and dynamics research is being done under various projects in the Fundamental Aeronautics Program (FAP). For turbine engines, work on Distributed Engine Control (DEC) and Model-Based Engine Control (MBEC)is currently being done under the Subsonic Fixed Wing (SFW) project, and Active Combustion Control research is currently being done under the Supersonics (SUP) project. These 3 efforts are expected to transition to the new Aeronautics Sciences (AS) project in FY13. Aero-Propulso-Servo-Elasticity (APSE) research will continue under the SUP project. Research activity on Controls/Dynamics for electric propulsion systems is expected to be initiated in FY13 under the reformulated Fixed Wing (FW) project. Propulsion control and dynamics technologies that help achieve the goals of FAP, in terms of: reducing emissions; increasing fuel efficiency; tool and technology development and validation to address challenges in High Speed flight; and enabling fast, efficient design and analysis of advanced aviation systems, are of interest. Proposed activities that are compatible with current propulsion controls and dynamics activities supported by the FAP will be given preference. Following technologies are of specific interest: High Efficiency Robust Engine Control - Typical current operating engine control logic is designed using SISO (Single Input Single Output) PI (Proportional+Integral) control. The control logic is designed to provide minimum guaranteed performance while maintaining adequate safety margins throughout the engine operating life. Additionally, the control logic provides control of variables of interest such as Thrust, Stall Margin etc. indirectly since these variables cannot be measured or are not measured in flight because of restrictions on sensor cost/placement/reliability etc. All this results in highly conservative control design with resulting loss in efficiency. NASA is currently conducting research in Model-Based Engine Control (MBEC) where-in an on-board real-time engine model, tuned to reflect current engine condition, is used to generate estimate of quantities of interest that are to be regulated or limited and these estimates are used to provide direct control of Thrust etc. Alternate methods such as Model Predictive Control, Adaptive Control, direct non-linear control, etc. which will achieve the same objectives as the current MBEC approach while providing practical application of the control logic in terms of operation with sensor noise, operation across varying atmospheric conditions, operation across varying engine health condition over the operating life, and real-time operation within engine control hardware limits, are of interest. The emphasis is on practical application of existing control methods rather than theoretical derivation of totally new concepts. Control design approaches that can accommodate small to medium engine component faults and can still provide desired performance with safe operation are of special interest. The pre-requisite for proposals for engine control design methods is that the NASA C-MAPSS40k (Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation for 40,000 lb class thrust engine) be used for control design and evaluation. This simulation can only be used by U.S. citizens since it is subject to export control laws. Methods for real-time engine parameter identification using flight data are also of interest by themselves. Distributed Engine Control - Current engine control architectures impose limitations on the insertion of new control capabilities primarily due to weight penalties and reliability issues related to complex wiring harnesses. Obsolescence management is also a primary concern in these systems because of the unscheduled cost impact and recertification issues over the engine life cycle. NASA in collaboration with AFRL (Air Force Research Lab) has been conducting research in developing technologies to enable Distributed Engine Control (DEC) architectures. The current need is to develop a DEC test-bed which can be used to investigate a wide range of issues such as system robustness, stability and performance of various DEC architectures, the development of network communications requirements, network performance evaluation, robustness of DEC architectures to data transmission faults and impact on system performance. The tools just described must be compatible with the NASA C-MAPSS40k simulation software and easily integrated into the Hardware-in-the-Loop research facility currently being developed under a separate contract. Restrictions on access to these technologies require that any proposed effort will be limited to work being done by U.S. citizens. Active Combustion Control - The overall objective is to develop all aspects of control systems to enable safe operation of low emissions combustors throughout the engine operating envelope. Low emission combustors are prone to thermo-acoustic instabilities. So far NASA research in this area has focused on modulating the main or pilot fuel flow to suppress such instability. Advanced, ultra-low emissions combustors utilize multi-point (multi-location) injection to achieve a homogeneous, lean fuel/air mixture. There is new interest in using precise control of fuel flow in such a manner as to suppress or avoid thermo-acoustic instabilities. Miniature fuel metering devices (and possibly also fuel flow measurement devices) are needed that can be physically distributed to be close to the multi-point fuel injector in order to enable the control system to accurately place a given proportion of the overall fuel flow to each of the fuel injection locations. Aero-Propulso-Servo-Elasticity (APSE) - The objective of NASA research effort in APSE is to develop a comprehensive dynamic propulsion system model that can be utilized for thrust dynamics and integrated APSE vehicle controls and performance studies, like vehicle ride quality and vehicle stability under typical vehicle maneuvering and atmospheric disturbances, for supersonic vehicles. Innovative approaches to dynamic modeling of supersonic external compression inlets; parallel flow path modeling of the compression and whole propulsion system to accurately model the distortion effects of flexible modes, maneuvering and atmospheric disturbances; and integration of dynamic propulsion models with aircraft simulations incorporating flexible modes, are of interest. Electric Propulsion Systems -The objective is to achieve the required increase in the specific power of high efficiency electric components to make a 10 mega-watt onboard power generation and/or utilization feasible for propulsion. Specific areas of interest are: advanced electric power control systems for energy management of battery and fuel cell systems including potentiostatic sensor array to determine battery state-of-charge (SOC) and battery cycle affected state lifetimes; advanced phase angle control systems for electric motors; and advanced power control systems for effective management of large multi-motor arrays designated for use in newer turbo-electric aircraft and embedded boundary layer electric propulsion systems.Read less>>"
Aeronautics Research,Topic A3 Air Vehicle Technologies ,A3.06Physics-Based Conceptual Design Tools, GRC, LaRC,"Conceptual design and analysis of unconventional vehicle concepts and technologies is needed for technology portfolio investment planning, development of advanced concepts to provide technology pull and independent technical assessment of new concepts. The aerospace flight vehicle conceptual design phase is the most important step in the product development sequence, because of its predefining function. However, the conceptual design phase is the least well understood part of the entire flight vehicle design process, owing to its high level of abstraction and associated risk, its multidisciplinary design complexity, its permanent shortage of available design information and its chronic time pressure to find solutions. Often, the important primary aerospace vehicle design decisions at the conceptual design level (e.g., overall configuration selection) are still made using simple analyses and heuristics. Progress has been made recently in incorporating more physic-based analysis tools in the conceptual design process, especially in the aerodynamics area, and NASA has developed a capability that integrates several analysis tools and models in engineering architectures, such as ModelCenter and OpenMDAO. However, gaps still remain in many disciplines. Developing higher order, high fidelity tools suitable for conceptual design is a difficult challenge. The first issue is analysis turnaround time. To perform the configuration trades and optimization typical of conceptual design, runtimes measured in seconds or minutes, instead of hours or days, are required. However, rapid analysis turn around time alone is insufficient. To be suitable for conceptual design, tools and methods are needed which accurately predict the ""as-built"" characteristics. Because it is not possible to model every detail of the design and account for all the underlying physics in the problem formulation, it is difficult to predict the ""as-built"" characteristics with physics-based methods alone. What is usually required is a combination of these methods with some semi-empirical corrections. Ignoring this aspect can lead to higher order tools which are lower fidelity (less accurate) than the lower order tools they are intended to replace. Another challenge in conceptual design is a lack of detailed design information. Lower order, empirical-based methods typically used in the past for conceptual design often require only gross design parameters as inputs. It is, therefore, not necessary to know design details to obtain a reasonable estimate of the design's performance. High-order, physics-based methods currently require detailed design knowledge to be useful. For example, whereas semi-empirical drag prediction tools provide estimates for wing drag without needing full 3-D geometry including an airfoil design, such detail is necessary to successfully utilize CFD tools. This gap in the analysis capability and the maturity of the design being analyzed limits the usefulness of the high order analysis in conceptual design. Physics-based tools for conceptual design must be developed which are consistent with the amount of design knowledge that is available at the conceptual design stage. NASA continues to investigate the potential of advanced, innovative propulsion and aircraft to improve fuel efficiency (i.e, reduce CO2 emissions) and to reduce the environmental footprint (noise and NOx) of future generations of commercial transports across the flight speed regime. As such, the agency's systems analysts need to have the best design/analysis tools possible. The intention of this sub-topic is to solicit proposals for robust, physics-based tools enabling unconventional configurations to be addressed in the conceptual design process. Specifically for 2012, the solicitation will center on new tools and methods that pertain to the propulsion system. Modeling areas where enhanced capabilities are desired include the following: Electric/Turbo-electric performance & weight estimation methodologies. Some examples: Electric component performance/weight estimation. Electric grid performance and analysis. Thermal management analysis. Enhanced propulsion system performance & weight methodologies.

Small-body mission manipulation technologies are needed to deploy sampling tools to the surface and transfer samples to in-situ instruments and sample storage containers. Sample acquisition tools are needed to acquire samples on planetary and small bodies. For Mars, a coring tool is needed to acquire rock and regolith cores approximately 1cm diameter and up to 10cm long which also supports transfer of the samples to a sample handling system. Abrading bits for the tool are needed to provide rock-surface abrasion capability to better than 0.2mm scale roughness. A deep drill is needed to enable sample acquisition from the subsurface including rock cores to 3m depth and icy samples from deeper locations. Tools for sampling from asteroids and comets are needed which support transfer of the sample for in-situ analysis or sample return. Tools for acquisition and transfer of icy samples on Europa are also of interest. Minimization of mass and ability to work reliably in the harsh mission environment are important characteristics for the tools.

Science,Topic S5 Information Technologies ,S5.01Technologies for Large-Scale Numerical Simulation, ARC, GSFC,"NASA scientists and engineers are increasingly turning to large-scale numerical simulation on supercomputers to advance understanding of complex Earth and astrophysical systems, and to conduct high-fidelity aerospace engineering analyses. The goal of this subtopic is to increase the mission impact of NASA's investments in supercomputing systems and associated operations and services. Specific objectives are to: Decrease the barriers to entry for prospective supercomputing users. Minimize the supercomputer user's total time-to-solution (e.g., time to discover, understand, predict, or design). Increase the achievable scale and complexity of computational analysis, data ingest, and data communications. Reduce the cost of providing a given level of supercomputing performance on NASA applications. Enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of NASA's supercomputing operations and services. Expected outcomes are to improve the productivity of NASA's supercomputing users, broaden NASA's supercomputing user base, accelerate advancement of NASA science and engineering, and benefit the supercomputing community through dissemination of operational best practices. The approach of this subtopic is to seek novel software and hardware technologies that provide notable benefits to NASA's supercomputing users and facilities, and to infuse these technologies into NASA supercomputing operations. Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, NASA's high-end computing (HEC) projects: the High End Computing Capability project at Ames and the Scientific Computing project at Goddard. To assure maximum relevance to NASA, funded SBIR contracts under this subtopic should engage in direct interactions with one or both HEC projects, and with key HEC users where appropriate. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and NASA relevance during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration. Offerors should demonstrate awareness of the state-of-the-art of their proposed technology, and should leverage existing commercial capabilities and research efforts where appropriate. Open Source software and open standards are strongly preferred. Note that the NASA supercomputing environment is characterized by: HEC systems operating behind a firewall to meet strict IT security requirements, communication-intensive applications, massive computations requiring high concurrency, complex computational workflows and immense datasets, and the need to support hundreds of complex application codes - many of which are frequently updated by the user/developer. As a result, solutions that involve the following must clearly explain how they would work in the NASA environment: Grid computing, web services, client-server models, embarrassingly parallel computations, and technologies that require significant application re-engineering. Projects need not benefit all NASA HEC users or application codes, but demonstrating applicability to an important NASA discipline, or even a key NASA application code, could provide significant value. Specific technology areas of interest: Efficient Computing: In spite of the rapidly increasing capability and efficiency of supercomputers, NASA's HEC facilities cannot purchase, power, and cool sufficient HEC resources to satisfy all user demands. This subtopic element seeks dramatically more efficient and effective supercomputing approaches in terms of their ability to supply increased HEC capability or capacity per dollar and/or per Watt for real NASA applications. Examples include: Novel computational accelerators and architectures. Cloud supercomputing with high performance interconnects (e.g., InfiniBand). Enhanced visualization technologies. Improved algorithms for key codes. Power-aware ""Green"" computing technologies and techniques. Approaches to effectively manage and utilize many-core processors including algorithmic changes, compiler techniques and runtime systems. User Productivity Environments: The user interface to a supercomputer is typically a command line in a text window. This subtopic element seeks more intuitive, intelligent, user-customizable, and integrated interfaces to supercomputing resources, enabling users to more completely leverage the power of HEC to increase their productivity. Such an interface could enhance many essential supercomputing tasks: accessing and managing resources, training, getting services, developing and porting codes (e.g., debugging and performance analysis), running computations, managing files and data, analyzing and visualizing results, transmitting data, collaborating, etc. Ultra-Scale Computing: Over the next decade, the HEC community faces great challenges in enabling its users to effectively exploit next-generation supercomputers featuring massive concurrency to the tune of millions of cores.

Science,Topic S5 Information Technologies ,"S5.03Algorithms and Tools for Science Data Processing, Discovery and Analysis, in State-of-the-Art Data Environments", GSFC," ARC, JPL, KSC, LaRC, MSFC, SSC","The size of NASA's observational data sets is growing dramatically as new missions come on line. In addition, NASA scientists continue to generate new models that regularly produce data sets of hundreds of terabytes or more. It is growing ever increasingly difficult to manage all of the data through its full lifecycle, as well as provide effective data analytical methods to analyze the large amount of data. For example, the HyspIRI mission is expected to produce an average science data rate of 800 Million bits per second (Mbps), JPSS-1 will be 300 Mbps and NPP is already producing 300 Mbps, compared to 150 Mbps for the EOS-Terra, Aqua and Aura missions. Other examples are SDO with a rate of 150 Mbps and 16.4 Gigabits for a single image from the HiRise camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). This subtopic area seeks innovation and unique approaches to solve issues associated around the use of ""Big Data"" within NASA. The emphasis of this subtopic is on tools that leverage existing systems, interfaces, and infrastructure, where it exists and where appropriate. Reuse of existing NASA assets is strongly encouraged. Specifically, innovations are being sought in the following areas: Parallel Processing for Data Analytics  Open source tools like the Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS) have shown promise for use in simple MapReduce operations to analyze model and observation data. In addition to HDFS, there is a rapid emergence and adoption of cloud software packages integrated with object stores, such as OpenStack and Swift. The goal is to accelerate these types of open source tools for use with binary structured data from observations and model output using MapReduce or a similar paradigm.High Performance File System Abstractions  NASA scientists currently use a large number of existing applications for data analysis, such as GrADS, python scripts, and more, that are not compatible with an object storage environment. If data were stored within an object storage environment, these applications would not be able to access the data. Many of these applications would require a substantial amount of investment to enable them to use object storage file systems. Therefore, a file system abstraction, such as FUSE (file system in user space) is needed to facilitate the use of existing data analysis applications with an object storage environment. The goal is to make a FUSE-like file system abstraction robust, reliable, and highly performing for use with large NASA data sets.Data Management of Large-Scale Scientific Repositories  With increasing size of scientific repositories comes an increasing demand for using the data in ways that may never have been imagined when the repository was conceived. The goal is to provide capabilities for the flexible repurposing of scientific data, including large-scale data integration, aggregation, representation, and distribution to emerging user communities and applications.Server Side Data Processing  Large data repositories make it necessary for analytical codes to migrate to where the data are stored. Hadoop does that at the level of a single HDFS. In a densely networked world of geographically distributed repositories, tiered intermediation is needed. The goal is to provide support for migratable codes and analytical outputs as first class objects within a provenance-oriented data management cyberinfrastructure. Techniques for Data Analysis and Visualization  New methods for data analytics that scale to extremely large data sets are necessary for data mining, searching, fusion, subsetting, discovery, visualization, and more. In addition, new algorithms and methods are needed to look for unknown correlations across large, distributed scientific data sets. The goal is to increase the scientific value of model and observation data by making analysis easier and higher performing. Among others, some of the topics of interest are: Techniques for automated derivation of analysis products such as machine learning for extraction of features in large image datasets (e.g., volcanic thermal measurement, plume measurement, automated flood mapping, disturbance mapping, change detection, etc.). Workflows for automated data processing, interpretation, and distribution.Accelerated Large Scale Data Movement  There are a multitude of large distributed data stores across NASA that includes both observation and model data. The movement of data across the network must be optimized to take full advantage of large-scale data analytics, especially when comparing model to observation data. The goal is to optimize data movement in the following ways: Accelerate and make it easier to move data over the wide area to facilitate large-scale data management and analysis. Optimize the movement of data within more local environments, such as the usage of Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) within HDFS. Virtualization of high-speed network interfaces for use within cloud environments. Research proposed to this subtopic should demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I, and in partnership with scientists, show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration, with significant communication with missions and programs to ensure a successful Phase III infusion. It is highly desirable that the proposed projects lead to software that is infused into NASA programs and projects. Tools and products developed under this subtopic may be used for broad public dissemination or within a narrow scientific community. These tools can be plug-ins or enhancements to existing software, on-line data/computing services, or new stand-alone applications or web services, provided that they promote interoperability and use standard protocols, file formats and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) or prevalent applications.Read less>>"
Science,Topic S5 Information Technologies ,S5.04Integrated Science Mission Modeling, GSFC," ARC, JPL","NASA seeks innovative systems modeling methods and tools to:Define, develop and execute future science missions, many of which are likely to feature designs and operational concepts that will pose significant challenges to existing approaches and applications, and Enable disciplined system analysis for the ongoing management and decision support of the space science technology portfolio, particularly with regard to understanding technology alternatives, relationships, priorities, timing, availability, down-selection, maturation, investment needs, system engineering considerations, and cost-to-benefit ratios; to examine ""what-if"" scenarios; and to facilitate multidisciplinary assessment, coordination, and integration of the technology roadmaps as a whole. Use of System Modeling Language (SysML) is encouraged but not required. SysML is a general purpose graphical modeling language for analyzing, designing and verifying complex systems that may include hardware, software, information, personnel, procedures and facilities. As a language, SysML represents requirements, structure, behavior, and equations in nine different diagram types, and can represent both hardware and software models. The language can be extended to provide metamodels for different disciplines, and is supported by multiple commercial tools. SysML is finding increased use throughout the agency to support systems engineering and analysis. Specific areas of interest include the following: Integration of system and mission modeling tools with high-fidelity multidisciplinary design and modeling tools, supporting efficient analysis methods that accommodate uncertainty, multiple objectives, and large-scale systems - This requires the development of robust interfaces between SysML and other tools, including CAD/CAE/PDM/PLM applications, used to support NASA science mission development, implementation and operations. The objective is to produce a unified environment supporting mixed systems-level and detailed analysis during any lifecycle phase, and rapid analysis of widely varying concepts/configurations using mixed-fidelity models, including geometry/mesh-based models when required. The human interface for such a system could be a ""dashboard"" (web-based is highly desirable) which initially allows for monitoring of the dataflow across a heterogeneous set of tools and finally allows for control of the data flow between the variety of applications. Modeling and rapid integration of programmatic, operational, and risk elements - Fully integrated system model representations must include non-physics based constructs such as cost, schedule, risk, operations, and organizational model elements. Novel methods and tools to model these system attributes are critical. In addition, approaches to integrate these in a meaningful way with other system model elements are needed. Methods that consider the development of these models as by-products of a collaborative and/or concurrent design process are particularly valuable. Library of SysML models of NASA related systems - Using a library of SysML models, engineers will be able to design their systems by reusing a set of existing models. Too often, these engineers have to begin from scratch the design of the systems. A library of verified and validated models would provide a way for the engineers to design a new spacecraft by assembling existing models that are domain specific, and therefore easy to adapt to the target system. In order to provide for seamless integration between SysML models each model must identify it level of abstraction both in terms of the modeling of time (progression: no ordering of events, qualitative ordering of events, metric time ordering of events) and the modeling of space (progression: lumped parameters models, distributed parameter models). Such levels of abstraction ""certificates"" for SysML will help determine integration interface requirements between any two models. Profiles for spacecraft, space robotics, and scientific instruments - Profiles provide a means of tailoring SysML for particular purposes. Extensions of the language can be inserted. This allows an organization to create domain specific constructs which extend existing SysML modeling elements. By developing profiles for NASA domains such as Spacecraft, Space Robotics and Scientific Instruments, powerful mechanisms will be available to NASA systems engineers for designing future space systems. Requirements Modeling - SysML offers requirements modeling capabilities, thus providing ways to visualize important requirements relationships. There is a need to combine traditional requirements management, supported by tools including but not limited to DOORS and CRADLE, and SysML requirements modeling in a standardized and sustainable way. Functional Modeling - The intermediate data products between requirements and specification are detailed functional models that identify all of the functions required to achieve the mission profile(s). There is a critical need to model this layer as it is a key data product to provide traceability between requirements and implementation. Model and Modeling Process Synthesis - As model-based design broadens and integrates larger and more complex models, methods for how to sequence and operate the design synthesis, evaluation (e.g., V&V) and elaboration process will become more important, as will considerations of how model-based processes are made compatible with existing review and development cycles.

Science,Topic S5 Information Technologies ,S5.05Fault Management Technologies, MSFC," ARC, JPL","As science missions are given increasingly complex goals and have more pressure to reduce operations costs, system autonomy increases. Fault Management (FM) is one of the key components of system autonomy. FM consists of the operational mitigations of spacecraft failures. It is implemented with spacecraft hardware, on-board autonomous software that controls hardware, software, information redundancy, and ground-based software and operations procedures. Many recent Science Mission Directorate (SMD) missions have encountered major cost overruns and schedule slips during test and verification of FM functions. These overruns are due to a lack of understanding of FM functions early in the mission definition cycles and to FM architectures that do not provide attributes of transparency, verifiability, fault isolation capability, or fault coverage. The NASA FM Handbook is under development to improve the FM design, development, verification & validation and operations processes. FM approaches, architectures, and tools are needed to improve early understanding of needed FM capabilities by project managers and FM engineers and to improve the efficiency of implementing and testing FM. Specific objectives are to: Improve ability to predict FM system complexity and estimate development and operations costs. Enable cost-effective FM design architectures and operations. Determine completeness and appropriateness of FM designs and implementations. Decrease the labor and time required to develop and test FM models and algorithms. Improve visualization of the full FM design across hardware, software, and operations procedures. Determine extent of testing required, completeness of verification planned, and residual risk resulting from incomplete coverage. Increase data integrity between multi-discipline tools. Standardize metrics and calculations across FM, SE, S&MA and operations disciplines. Increase reliability of FM systems. Expected outcomes are better estimation and control of FM complexity and development costs, improved FM designs, and accelerated advancement of FM tools and techniques. The approach of this subtopic is to seek the right balance between sufficient reliability and cost appropriate to the mission type and risk posture. Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, SMD missions. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and NASA relevance during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration. Offerors should demonstrate awareness of the state-of-the-art of their proposed technology, and should leverage existing commercial capabilities and research efforts where appropriate. Specific technology in the forms listed below is needed to increase delivery of high quality FM systems. These approaches, architectures and tools must be consistent with and enable the NASA FM Handbook concepts and processes. FM design tools - System modeling and analyses significantly contributes to the quality of FM design; however, the time it takes to translate system design information into system models often decreases the value of the modeling and analysis results. Examples of enabling techniques and tools are modeling automation, spacecraft modeling libraries, expedited algorithm development, sensor placement analyses, and system model tool integration. FM visualization tools - FM systems incorporate hardware, software, and operations mechanisms. The ability to visualize the full FM system and the contribution of each mechanism to protecting mission functions and assets is critical to assessing the completeness and appropriateness of the FM design to the mission attributes (mission type, risk posture, operations concept, etc.). Fault trees and state transition diagrams are examples of visualization tools that could contribute to visualization of the full FM design. FM verification and validation tools - As complexity of spacecraft and systems increases, the extensiveness of testing required to verify and validate FM implementations can be resource intensive. Automated test case development, false positive/false negative test tools, model verification and validation tools, and test coverage risk assessments are examples of contributing technologies. FM Design Architectures - FM capabilities may be implemented through numerous system, hardware, and software architecture solutions. The FM architecture trade space includes options such as embedded in the flight control software or independent onboard software; on board versus ground-based capabilities; centralized or distributed FM functions; sensor suite implications; integration of multiple FM techniques; innovative software FM architectures implemented on flight processors or on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs); and execution in real-time or off-line analysis post-operations. Alternative architecture choices could help control FM system complexity and cost and could offer solutions to transparency, verifiability, and completeness challenges. Multi-discipline FM Interoperation - FM designers, Systems Engineering, Safety and Mission Assurance, and Operations perform analyses and assessments of reliabilities, failure modes and effects, sensor coverage, failure probabilities, anomaly detection and response, contingency operations, etc. The relationships between multi-discipline data and analyses are inconsistent and misinterpreted. Resources are expended either in effort to resolve disconnects in data and analyses or worse, reduced mission success due to failure modes that were overlooked. Solutions that address data integrity, identification of metrics, and standardization of data products, techniques and analyses will reduce cost and failures.Read less>>"

Non-toxic engine technology, including new mono and bipropellants, is desired for use in lieu of the currently operational NTO/MMH engine technology. Handling and safety concerns with toxic chemical propellants can lead to more costly propulsion systems. NTP systems using nuclear fission reactors may enable future short round trip missions to Mars, by helping to reduce launch mass to reasonable values and thereby increasing the payload delivered for Mars exploration missions.

Specific process technology advancements are sought in the technical areas of regenerative CO2 removal, process gas drying, regenerable particulate matter filtration and separation techniques, and photocatalytic processes for removing trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from cabin atmospheric gases. Specifics pertaining to each technical area are the following: Advanced Sorbents for CO2 Removal - Development of robust, high capacity, regenerable CO2 adsorbents that substantially reduce the energy required for regeneration, are resistant to material degradation (i.e., dusting, spalling) and are highly selective to CO2 over moisture.

Human Exploration and Operations,Topic H3 Life Support and Habitation Systems ,H3.04Thermal Control Systems, JSC," GRC, GSFC, JPL, KSC, LaRC, MSFC","Future human spacecraft will venture far beyond the relatively benign environment of low Earth orbit. They will transit through the deep space, but they may encounter warm transient environments such as low lunar orbit. Some spacecraft elements may be launched untended and would operate at relatively low power levels as they transit to their final destination. The combination of extreme environments and high turndown capability will be a major challenge for spacecraft Active Thermal Control Systems (ATCSs). Sophisticated thermal control systems will be required that can dissipate a wide range of heat loads in widely varying environments while using fewer of the limited spacecraft mass, volume and power resources.

Human Exploration and Operations,Topic H4 Extra-Vehicular Activity Technology ,H4.01Space Suit Pressure Garment and Airlock Technologies, JSC, GRC,"Advanced space suit pressure garment and airlock technologies are necessary for the successful support of the International space Station (ISS) and future human space exploration missions for in-space microgravity EVA and planetary surface operations. The space suit pressure garment requires innovative technologies focused on performance, environmental protection, and mass reduction. Two of the critical performance characteristics of a suit are mobility and durability. Improved mobility typically competes against durability and suit component life. Materials that enable both highly mobile and durable designs would negate the need for compromise in one of these areas. Other key suit performance enhancements include materials that enable improved fit and sizing, such as shape change materials that increase the ease of suit don/doff or facilitate adaptable fit for specific functional tasks. Space suit environmental protection includes protection from thermal extremes, vacuum, cuts, abrasion and micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD). Additional environmental protection is desired for plasma, radiation, electrical shock, antimicrobials and dust. It is desirable to provide protection in as few material layers as possible; therefore, multi-functional materials are desired. Self-healing materials and materials that alert the inspector to wear/maintenance needs are also of interest. Mass reduction of the space suit system is highly desirable for many reasons, with arguably the biggest drivers being launch mass and on-back mass during EVA. New materials that can lead to reductions in suit component mass, for example, lightweight materials for bearings and hard structures, are therefore desirable. Due to the expected large number of space walks that will be performed on the ISS beyond 2020 and during future human space exploration missions, innovative technologies and designs for both microgravity and surface airlocks will be needed. Technology development is needed to decrease the time associated with egressing and ingressing the vehicle or habitat, reducing the gas loss during depressurization, and decreasing the potential of contaminating the cabin due to bringing in dust or CO2. These enhancements could be achieved with a suitport, suitlock or some type of advanced airlock. Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) of 4 to 6 or higher are sought.

Human Exploration and Operations,Topic H4 Extra-Vehicular Activity Technology ,H4.02Space Suit Life Support and Avionics Systems, JSC, GRC,"Space Suit Life Support Systems Advanced space suit life support systems are necessary for the successful support of the International Space Station (ISS) and future human space exploration missions for in-space microgravity EVA and planetary surface operations. Exploration missions will require a robust, lightweight, and maintainable Primary Life Support System (PLSS). The PLSS attaches to the space suit pressure garment and provides approximately an 8 hour supply of oxygen for breathing, suit pressurization, ventilation and CO2 removal, and a thermal control system for crew member metabolic heat rejection. Innovative technologies are needed for high-pressure O2 delivery, crewmember cooling, heat rejection, and removal of expired CO2 and water vapor. Space Suit Avionics Systems Future generations of advanced space suit avionics will be far superior to those on the current generation of space suits. They will be more capable, configurable, lightweight, and low power with a footprint that will rival current consumer electronic devices, but survive the harsh space environment. They must be self-contained, so that maintenance on the devices can be performed on-orbit or they can be easily swapped for functioning or upgraded devices. Those considered will be radio, displays, and cameras. Future advanced radios will be configurable and, potentially, software-defined and/or re-configurable to support future communications network-based architectures in addition to the point-to-point communications links that are prevalent today. The next-generation EVA radios will need to support voice, telemetry, and standard/high definition video data flows (up to 20 Mbps) and the radio architecture will need to be lightweight and power efficient while managing data in a seamless and lossless manner between multiple interfaces. Radios should support space-based or terrestrial-based protocols to enable communications between multiple entities across a communications link and have an open and modular architecture. The current generation of Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) and Near-to-Eye (NTE) Displays are not viable, since it is desirable for the display to be decoupled from the user's head for improved safety, comfort, and alignment. The decoupling makes the specifications for the eyebox (tolerance to misalignment before image goes out of focus), field of view (angle of the image created by the optics), and eye relief (working distance from the eye to the last optical element) difficult. Key performance targets include: Graphical Data Presentation: SXGA @ 40 °FOV (possibly biocular). Decoupled from User's Head - Large Eyebox: 100 mm x 100mm x 50mm (D). Sunlight Readability: 500 fL inside visor, 1800 fL outside visor (>10 to 1 contrast). Display technologies must ensure that suit displays can operate outside the suit environment in thermal, radiation, and vacuum as well as internally without imposing ignition hazards due to 100% oxygen environment. Cameras will not only provide the crewmember the ability for still and motion image, but also situational awareness, which enhances safety for the crewmember. The cameras should be capable of recording high definition motion and high-resolution imagery with the ability to compress the data for transmission over a variety of RF transmissions and/or IP networks with varying bandwidths. Hemispherical and dynamic cameras are desired. Dynamic cameras can take still images and motion video in variable bandwidths, capture images based on link quality, and change frame rates. Hemispherical cameras record 360 ° video views of a crewmember, distort views through optics and then undistort the views via software on the ground to pan/zoom for total situational awareness. Cameras should be low-power and lightweight with a number of mounting options for optimal placement on the suit. Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) of 4 to 6 or higher are sought.

Post-processed GPS position determination performance accuracy is at the cm-level at Near-Earth distances and at meter-level at High-Earth Orbit distances; while autonomous real-time GPS performance, such as provided by GPS-Enhanced Onboard Navigation System (GEONS) can achieve accuracy performance of 20 meters. For missions at Mars, Deep Space Network navigation services provide performance accuracy of 1km, while optical navigation methodologies obtain performance accuracy of 10s of km at this distance. Future NASA missions will require precision landing, rendezvous, formation flying, cooperative robotics, proximity operations, and coordinated platform operations. As such, the need for increased precision in absolute and relative navigation solutions increases. As operations occur further from Earth and more complex navigational maneuvers are performed, it will be necessary to reduce the reliance on Earth-based systems for real-time decisions.

As a design tool, the insight gained into the crew members' interaction with the outside world would be valuable for developing new mission training regimens and design concepts for future long-duration missions. The proposal shall describe:The virtual environment to be developed. Plans to provide adaptive systems to deal with communication latencies. How the tool could enhance and measure behavioral health and performance, including perceived closeness to home. Ways to assess habitability issues. NASA Deliverables - Phase I deliverable shall yield a proof of concept that includes both an evidence review that encompasses an assessment of current knowledge of virtual reality technologies and their use in supporting this topic. In addition, the following deliverables shall be required: A requirements document for such a support system that fits the needs of a NASA exploration mission. A plan for evaluating the effectiveness of the tool as a behavioral health countermeasure, training, and habitability assessment. The subsequent Phase II deliverable shall provide a prototype of specific modules that can demonstrate improved communication and perceived social support by utilizing these technologies.HRP IRP Risks - Risk of Adverse Behavioral Conditions and Psychiatric Disorders; Risk of Performance Decrements Due to Inadequate Cooperation, Coordination, Communication, and Psychosocial Adaptation within a Team; Risk of an Incompatible Vehicle/Habitat Design Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) of 4 or higher are sought.

Human Exploration and Operations,Topic H12 Human Research and Health Maintenance ,H12.04Advanced Food Systems Technology, JSC, GRC,"The purpose of the NASA Advanced Food Technology Project is to develop, evaluate and deliver food technologies for human centered spacecraft that will support crews on long duration missions beyond low-Earth orbit. Safe, nutritious, acceptable, and varied shelf-stable foods with a shelf life of 5 years will be required to support the crew during these exploration missions. Concurrently, the food system must efficiently balance appropriate vehicle resources such as mass, volume, water, air, waste, power, and crew time. Refrigeration and freezing require significant vehicle resource utilization, so NASA provisions consist solely of shelf stable foods. Stability is achieved by thermal or irradiative processing to kill the microorganisms in the food, or drying to prevent viability of the microorganisms. These methods do impact the micronutrients within the food substrate. Environmental factors (such as moisture ingress and oxidation) are also capable of compromising the nutrient content over the shelf life of the food. Since the food system is the sole source of nutrition to the crew, a significant loss in nutrient availability could significantly jeopardize the health and performance of the crew. Optimal nutritional content of the food for five years will ensure that the food can support crew performance and help protect their bodies from deficiencies that cause disease. Vitamin content in NASA foods, such as vitamin C, vitamin A, thiamin, and folic acid, is degraded during processing and as the product ages in storage. The goal is to develop a system that either increases the bioavailability of the nutrients or protects the vitamins from this biological or chemical degradation at ambient temperatures over a five year duration. Possible technologies that could be investigated include novel food ingredients, protective or stabilizing technologies (e.g., encapsulation), biosensors, and controlled-release systems. Phase I Requirements - Phase I should concentrate on the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of the proposed innovation resulting in a feasibility report and concept, complete with analyses.NASA Deliverables - A system which will result in higher nutrient content in shelf stable foods.HRP IRP risk - Risk of Inadequate Food System Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) of 4 to 5 or higher are sought.

Human Exploration and Operations,Topic H12 Human Research and Health Maintenance ,H12.05In-Flight Biological Sample Analysis, JSC, ARC,"Although crewmembers undergo intensive medical screening, the possibility of crew injury or illness can never be completely eliminated. A mission could be jeopardized or compromised by reduction of able crewmembers, both directly and indirectly if an incapacitated crewmember requires nursing or care. Mission architecture limits the amount of equipment, consumables, and procedures that will be available to treat medical problems. Mission allocation and technology development must be performed to ensure that the limited mass, volume, power, and crew training time are used efficiently to provide the broadest possible treatment capability. There is also a gap in knowledge in how the spaceflight environment affects the effectiveness of drug therapies. This subtopic aims to mitigate those space mission constraints by means of innovative approaches for addressing the knowledge gap in the area of drug stability during long duration spaceflight. This subtopic seeks proposals for novel approaches to develop an in-flight tool capable of monitoring stability of pharmaceuticals (ideally, solids, liquids and creams) under low gravity conditions. Such a device must be able to determine percentage of active ingredients with a preference to also characterize degradation of products while minimizing the amount of pharmaceutical sample consumed in the test. The technology will need to address approaches and methodologies for handling the different forms of pharmaceuticals (pills, liquids, creams) through the use of a flexible sample preparation front-end amenable to the space environment. The proposed technology should be low-resource, low-footprint, and should involve a low volume of supplies/consumables, which do not require refrigeration or freezing for storage. Also, the technological innovation should be user-friendly, requiring minimal training and operating via uncomplicated protocols. The Phase I technology developed under this SBIR should investigate one or more one or more of the following drugs:Acetaminophen. Azithromycin. Injectable epinephrine. Lidocaine topical gel.In the Phase I effort, the proof of concept analysis should be demonstrated by the innovative technology and provide comparable results to drug stability laboratory USP standards (i.e., high performance liquid chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, UV/FTIR spectroscopy). Phase II will seek to optimize these results for additional drugs as well as sensitivity, compound identification, drug degradation products, analysis time and facilitated end-user protocols. NASA Deliverables: Prototype functional system in a proof of concept analysis demonstrated by the innovative technology producing drug stability characterization including integrity and percentage of active ingredients and characterization/degradation of products (in Phase I). Drugs to be demonstrated in Phase I include: Acetaminophen, Azithromycin, Injectable epinephrine and Lidocaine topical gel.HRP IRP Risks - Inability to Adequately Recognize or Treat an Ill or Injured Crew Member; Risk of Therapeutic Failure Due to Ineffectiveness of Medication Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) of 5 or higher are sought.

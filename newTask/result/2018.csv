Focus Area 1 In-Space Propulsion Technologies,Z10.01Cryogenic Fluid Management, GRC," JSC, MSFC", TA2 In-Space Propulsion Technologies, 2018,"This subtopic solicits technologies related to cryogenic propellants (such as hydrogen, oxygen, and methane) storage, and transfer to support NASA's exploration goals. This includes a wide range of applications, scales, and environments consistent with future NASA missions. Such missions include but are not limited to a Methane Upper Stage, Nuclear Thermal Propulsion, Lander Propulsion, and In-Situ Resource Utilization in support of the Evolvable Mars Campaign. Specifically, listed in order of importance: Develop reliable cryogenic screen channel acquisition devices (NASA is mainly interested in screens with pore sizes < 100 µm) using innovative manufacturing techniques to minimize stresses of cryogenic screen channels to improve screen-to-window manufacturing reliability. Reliability should be based on changes in bubble point pressure before and after thermal cycling the elements (> 10 times) at or below 77 K. New and improved technologies that provide for the densification (or sub-cooling) of cryogenic propellants. Propellant conditioning systems that allow for the production and maintenance of densified propellants that support operations including transfer and low-loss storage are of prime interest for future space vehicle and ground launch processing facilities. Advanced numerical design tools are sought for cryogenic propellant management systems accounting for large EUS-scale operations in relevant low-gravity (low-acceleration) environments. Ideally, such a tool should consider thermal gradients, acceleration gradients, perturbations due to docking, and orbital maneuvers in order to help system designers evaluate the impacts of these various environments to the propellant management system. Advanced numerical design tools are sought for fuels/cryogenic management systems accounting for large EUS-scale operations in relevant low-gravity (low-acceleration) environments considering the impacts of thermal gradients, gravity gradients, perturbations due to docking, orbital maneuvers, self-gravitation, and others. Develop an insulation to reduce the heat leak in the annulus space of approximately ¾”, which is located over a liquid hydrogen tank but under a broad area cooled (BAC) shield at 90 K for space applications. The insulation concept has the dual function of structurally supporting the 5 mil thick broad area cooled shield and roughly 35-40 outer layers of traditional multi-layer insulation (MLI) (or less with high performing MLI) and reducing the heat leak from the 90K surface to the LH2 tank. Analysis shall focus on the thermal design’s reduction of conductive and radiative heat transfer in the vacuum of space to minimize heat load (> 70% reduction in insulation heat load compared to equivalent MLI system without BAC shield) to the tank while being lightweight for flight. System/stage cryogenic valves sized for 3 in. (7.62 cm) tube size for low pressure (<50 psia; 3.4 bar), scalable to 10 in. (25.4 cm) size, with Cv > 200, low internal (~ 1 sccm, goal of < 0.1 sccm) and external (~ 3 sccm, goal of < 0.1 sccm) leakage, > 500 cycles with a goal of 5,000 cycles, low heat leak (<3 W/valve), low actuation power. The valve should have a clear path to combine with an actuator and its requirements. Electric Pump technologies with low power (<40-50 kW) at flowrates suitable for feeding iRCS accumulator(s) supplying a bank of four (4) 1000-lb RCS engines operating at total oxygen or methane mass flowrates of ~8-10 lb/s (3.6-4.5 kg/s), or Low power (<4-6 kW) supplying a bank of four (4) 100-lb RCS engines, operating at a total flowrate of ~1 lb/s (0.45 kg/s). The pumps will operate between low pressure (<50 psia; <3.4 bar) propellant tanks, up to supercritical pressures >667 psia (>46 bar) under varying duty cycle demand regimes. Note actual duty cycle requirements will be mission specific – proposers should describe scalability to handle changes in demand, and changes in the scale of thrusters per thruster bank (e.g., 3x100-lb & 1x1000-lb, etc.). Phase I proposals should at a minimum deliver proof of the concept including some sort of testing or physical demonstration (not just a paper study). Phase II proposals will be expected to provide component validation in a laboratory environment preferably with a hardware deliverable to NASA.

Focus Area 1 In-Space Propulsion Technologies,Z10.02Propulsion Systems for Robotic Science Missions, GRC," JPL, MSFC", TA2 In-Space Propulsion Technologies, 2018,"The Science Mission Directorate (SMD) needs spacecraft with more demanding propulsive performance and flexibility for more ambitious missions requiring high duty cycles, more challenging environmental conditions, and extended operation. Planetary spacecraft need the ability to rendezvous with, orbit, and conduct in-situ exploration of planets, moons, and other small bodies in the solar system. Mission priorities are outlined in the decadal surveys for each of the SMD Divisions. (https://science.nasa.gov/about-us/science-strategy/decadal-surveys) Future spacecraft and constellations of spacecraft will have high-precision propulsion requirements, usually in volume-, mass-, and power-limited envelopes. This subtopic seeks innovations to meet SMD propulsion in chemical and electric propulsion systems related to sample return missions to Mars, small bodies (like asteroids, comets, and Near-Earth Objects), outer planet moons, and Venus. Additional electric propulsion technology innovations are also sought to enable low-cost systems for Discovery class missions, and low-power, nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) missions. The roadmap for in space propulsion technologies can be found at the following Office of Chief Technologist website (https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/2015_nasa_technology_roadmaps_ta_2_in-space_propulsion_final.pdf). Proposals should show an understanding of the state-of-the-art (SOA), how their technology is superior, and of one or more relevant science needs. The proposals should provide a feasible plan to fully develop a technology and infuse it into a NASA program. In addressing technology requirements, proposers should identify potential mission applications and quantify the expected advancement over SOA alternatives. Advanced Electric Propulsion Components Towards that end, this subtopic seeks proposals that explore uses of technologies that will provide superior performance, reduce complexity, increase reliability, and/or lower cost for high specific impulse/low mass electric propulsion systems. These technologies include: Long-life heaters for hollow cathodes made with lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6) or other materials. In order to achieve reliable cathode ignition, the LaB6 heaters typically must operate at 1500 – 1700° C. Reproducible fabrication processes that minimize unit-to-unit variations in performance and lifetime will be critical for the practical adaptation of a new heater technology. High-temperature electromagnets for Hall thrusters, capable of operating reliably at >500° C. 3D printing of magnetic materials for Hall thruster magnetic circuits. Low-cost gas distributors capable of achieving a high degree of flow uniformity in Hall thruster anode gas feeds. Advanced ceramics for Hall thruster discharge chambers. Feed systems for ultra-high-Isp gridded ion thrusters running on lithium propellant. This subtopic also seeks to mature and demonstrate iodine electric propulsion technologies. Iodine propellant has two key advantages over the SOA xenon propellant: (i) increased storage density and (ii) reduced storage pressure. These key advantages permit iodine propulsion systems with conformal storage tanks, reduced structural mass, and reduced volume compared with the SOA xenon, while retaining similar thrust, specific impulse, and thruster efficiency. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to: Robust and electrically efficient iodine storage and delivery technology (scalable 1 kg to 100 kg iodine) for sub-kilowatt Hall Effect and Ion thrusters: Computational models are desired to evaluate novel iodine feed system concepts and CONOPS. Modeling capabilities of interest include, but are not limited to: Optimizing power consumption and iodine mass transport. Predicting sublimation rate and system pressures. Understanding expected anomalies such as iodine deposition, clog formation, clog recovery, and material interactions. Proposals are desired that systematically validate new modeling predictive capabilities with appropriate experimental demonstrations and perform investigations where existing literature is insufficient. High-reliability, long-life iodine storage and delivery systems are desired that package efficiently in volume-limited spacecraft, minimize spacecraft energy consumption, minimize thermal loading on spacecraft structures and neighboring components, and can remain quiescent for long periods with minimal or no maintenance or degenerative material interactions. Proposals are desired that offer supporting analysis or experimental evidence that a concept has merit. Proposals should provide a plan to theoretically refine the design concept, construct a prototype with a minimum 1 kg iodine capacity, perform experimental analysis in a relevant environment, refine the concept as necessary, and demonstrate. Demonstrations need not be performed with an operational thruster, but should be integrated in a test apparatus that reasonably replicates the fluid-dynamic and thermodynamic loads expected when integrated in a complete system. Given the current lack of demonstrated high life iodine compatible cathodes, hybrid feed systems are preferentially desired, which accommodate an iodine thruster matched with a xenon cathode (High life iodine compatible cathodes are also sought in this subtopic). High-reliability, long-life, compact, low-power iodine feed subsystem technologies are desired, including: Iodine compatible high-accuracy pressure sensors, novel propellant flow control and metering technologies, filtration, propellant management devices, etc. New iodine-compatible materials, coating, or otherwise innovative construction techniques leading to long-life, reliable, and corrosion resistant components.

Electric sail propulsion systems capable of achieving at least 1 mm/sec2 characteristic acceleration to support Heliophysics missions of interest and rapid outer solar system exploration. Electrodynamic tether/sail propulsion systems capable of generating from the Lorentz Force delta-V sufficient to de-orbit from altitudes up to 2,000 km and to maintain a small (< 500 kg) spacecraft in LEO at altitudes up to 400 km for 5 years enabling Earth ionospheric and plasmasphere investigations. Design solutions must demonstrate high deployment reliability and predictability with minimum mass and launch volume and maximum strength, stiffness, stability, and durability. In the case of tethers, advancements are needed for tether deployment and control, and for dynamic modeling/simulation and ground test methods, due to the high rate of space mission failures and anomalies for tether systems.

NTP had major technical work done between 1955-1973 as part of the Rover and Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA) programs. A few other NTP programs followed including the Space Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (SNTP) program in the early 1990's. The NTP concept is similar to a liquid chemical propulsion system, except instead of combustion in the thrust chamber, a monopropellant is heated with a fission reactor (heat exchanger) in the thrust chamber and exposes the engine components and surrounding structures to a radiation environment. Engine System Design Focus is on a range of modern technologies associated with NTP using solid core nuclear fission reactors and technologies needed to ground test the engine system and components. The engines are pump fed ~25,000 lbf with a specific impulse goal of 900 seconds (using hydrogen), and are used individually or in clusters for the spacecraft's primary propulsion system. The NTP can have multiple start-ups (>4) with cumulative run time >100 minutes in a single mission, which can last a few years. The Rover/NERVA program ground tested a variety of engine sizes, for a variety of burn durations and start-ups with the engine exhaust released to the open air. Current regulations require exhaust filtering of any radioactive noble gases and particulates. The NTP primary test requirements can have multiple start-ups (>8) with the longest single burn time ~50 minutes. Technologies being sought include: Low Enriched Uranium reactor fuel element designs with high temperature (> 2600 K), high power density (>5 MW/L) to optimize hydrogen propellant heating. New advanced manufacturing processes to quickly manufacture the fuel with uniform channel coatings and/or claddings that reduce fission product gas release and reactor particulates into the engines exhaust stream. Fuels are focused on Ceramic-metallic (cermet) designs: New fuel element geometries which are easy to manufacture and coat, and better performing than the traditional prismatic fuel geometries with small through holes with coatings. Best joining and manufacturing processes for tungsten, molybdenum, and molybdenum/tungsten alloys. Insulator design (one application is for tie tubes and the other is for interface with the pressure vessel) which has very low thermal conductivity and neutron absorption, withstands high temperatures, compatible with hot hydrogen and radiation environment, and light weight. Operations and Safety Engine operation involves start-up, full thrust operation, shutdown, coast, and restart. Technologies being sought include advanced instrumentation and special reactor safety design features which prevent uncontrolled reactor criticality accidents. Specific areas of interest include: Concepts to cool down the reactor decay heat after shutdown to minimize the amount of open cycle propellant used in each engine shutdown (Depending on the engine run time for a single burn, cool down time can take many hours). Low risk reactor design features which allow more criticality control flexibility during burns beyond the reactor circumferential rotating control drums, and/or provide nuclear safety for ground processing, launch, and possible launch aborts: Control of criticality with water submersion and compaction accidents. Ground Test Technologies Included in this area of technology development needs are identification and application of robust materials, advanced instruments and monitoring systems capable of operating in extreme temperature, pressure and radiation environments.

Devices for measurement of radiation, pressure, temperature and strain in a high temperature and radiation environment: Non-intrusive diagnostic technology to monitor engine exhaust for fuel element erosion/failure and release of radioactive particulates. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards Phase II hardware/software demonstration with delivery of a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.

Non-traditional approaches to switching devices, such as addition of graphene and carbon nanotubes to material. Lightweight, highly conductive power cables and/or cables integrated with vehicle structures. Intelligent power management and fault-tolerant electrical components and PMAD systems. Advanced electronic packaging for thermal control and electromagnetic shielding. Integrated packaging technology for modularity.
","Future science missions will require advanced primary and secondary battery systems capable of operating at temperature extremes from -100° C for Titan missions to 400 to 500° C for Venus missions, and a span of -230° C to +120° C for Lunar Quest. The Outer Planet Assessment Group and the 2011 PSD Relevant Technologies Document have specifically called out high energy density storage systems as a need for the Titan/Enceladus Flagship and planetary exploration missions. In addition, high energy-density rechargeable electrochemical battery systems that offer greater than 50,000 charge/discharge cycles (10-year operating life) for low-earth-orbiting spacecraft, 20-year life for geosynchronous (GEO) spacecraft, are desired. Advancements to battery energy storage capabilities that address one or more of the above requirements for the stated missions combined with very high specific energy and energy density (>200 Wh/kg for secondary battery systems), along with radiation tolerance are of interest.
In addition to batteries, other advanced energy storage/load leveling technologies designed to the above mission requirements, such as mechanical or magnetic energy storage devices, are of interest. These technologies have the potential to minimize the size and mass of future power systems.
Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II, and when possible, deliver a demonstration unit for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase II emphasis should be placed on developing and demonstrating the technology under relevant test conditions. Additionally, a path should be outlined that shows how the technology could be commercialized or further developed into science-worthy systems.

"Focus Area 2 Power, Energy and Storage",T3.02Intelligent/Autonomous Electrical Power Systems, GRC, JPL, TA3 Space Power and Energy Storage, 2018,"Missions to Mars and beyond experience communication delays with Earth of between 3 to 45 minutes. Due to this, it is impractical to rely on ground-based support and troubleshooting in the event of a power system fault or component failure. Intelligent/autonomous systems are required that can manage the power system in both normal mode and failure mode. In normal mode, the system would predict energy availability, perform load scheduling, maintain system security and status on-board and ground based personnel. One aspect of overall system autonomy would be solar array characterization, for spacecraft utilizing this technology. One drawback of current satellite systems is the lack of adequate means of determining solar panel or cell status. Being able to automatically characterize solar panel status can enhance energy availability prediction. Similar technology to access that status of battery systems would further enhance these predictions. In failure mode, the system must identify a fault or failure and perform contingency planning to react or reconfigure the system appropriately to move it back into normal mode of operation, without human involvement. The technologies to detect and identify specific failures in both the generation, distribution and storage systems are needed along with strategies to utilize the failure data to identify recovery strategies for the power system. With the potential of future manned missions to Mars, this technology will become increasingly important for electrical power management and distribution.

Focus Area 3 Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration,H6.02Resilient Autonomous Systems, ARC," JPL, JSC, MSFC"," TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems", 2018,"Future human spaceflight missions will place crews at large distances and light-time delays from Earth, requiring novel capabilities for crews with limited ground support to manage spacecraft, habitats, and supporting equipment to prevent Loss of Mission (LOM) or Loss of Crew (LOC) over extended duration missions. In particular, these capabilities are needed to handle faults leading to loss of critical function or unexpected expenditure of consumables. Expanded flight control functionality will be on-board spacecraft with significant automation, autonomy, and decision support software. The increasingly complex interconnectivity of these elements introduces new vulnerabilities within space systems that are sometimes impossible to predict. In that context, one key property of the respective system is its resilience to unforeseen events. Resilience, as defined by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences [1] (NAS), is the ability to plan and prepare for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events. This definition encompasses principles such as robustness, redundancy, modularity, and adaptability. To enable resilient behavior of a system (such as a vehicle, a habitat, a rover, etc.), ""resilience"" needs to be built-in during the design phase of the system development. To that end, the operational states of a system’s component need to be considered in conjunction with the intended function of the component and its possible failure modes throughout the vehicle's life cycle. Where possible, critical failures are eliminated during the design stage. For failure modes that cannot be eliminated, a mechanism needs to be devised that considers how to have optimal state awareness during operations and to mitigate the fault. Mitigation can be accomplished through fault avoidance, fault masking, or Fault Detection, Identification, and Recovery (FDIR). For the latter, system reconfiguration leveraging functional redundancies is of particular interest. Since a vehicle is made up of many components, a system-of-system’s approach needs to be considered in a multi-objective optimization context to account for interdependencies and to realize possible mutually beneficial mitigation solutions for resiliency. Proposals to this subtopic should specify innovation and approaches toward two goals: Development of methods and tools that allow the assessment and optimization of system resilience during its conceptual design stage, while simultaneously maximizing reliability and safety. Development of measures and metrics that quantify the degree of resilience of a system with respect to a mission ConOps and hazard analysis. Resilience measures and metrics must be general enough to support broad applications, yet precise enough to measure system-specific qualities. Such metrics are necessary to make resource and operations decisions. Risk metrics tend to assess risks to individualcomponents, ignoring system functionality as the result of interacting components. Resilience measures and metrics also ideally need to account for uncertainty in the planned operation of the system, and focus on integrating statistical methods for uncertainty propagation into resilience-based design. Rather than the static view of systems and networks in risk assessment, resilience adopts a dynamic view. This means resilience metrics must also consider the ability of a system to plan, prepare, and adapt as adverse events occur, rather than focus entirely on threat prevention and mitigation. Finally, resilience depends upon specific qualities that risk assessment cannot quantify, such as system flexibility and interconnectedness. Proposed solutions are expected to have characteristics including, but not limited to: Life-cycle models that encapsulate cost/benefit of envisioned design solution and that can be used to inform about the resilience of the system. Models may need to be built at the appropriate fidelity level to capture relevant fault behavior. Models may need to assess behavior and consequences during degraded (or faulted) state. Models should also be able to assess mitigation actions that are part of an integrated health management approach. Design optimization methodology that can systematically incorporate health management solutions. Methods that integrate optimal decision-making into the design concept. Methods that make use of both system health models and observations to provide the best decision given the information available. Methodology to allows bi-directional exchange between a model and the analysis tool. Methods that systemically include desired levels of resilience in the design optimization process. Desired, but not necessary: Uncertainty management: Identify the various sources of uncertainty that affect system performance, and quantify their combined effect on both system failure and resilience. Systematically incorporate uncertainty in the design process, thereby incorporating both resilience and likelihood of failure directly during the design stage. This SBIR work aims to generate a practical toolkit for space systems that can deliver solutions with assured levels of performance, reliability and resilience. Emphasis is on the design for resilience methodology, not on delivering entire systems. Metrics for success include: Development of generic quantitative measures and metrics that evaluate system resilience, and their application to space relevant systems or subsystems. Demonstrated improvement of resilience over baseline design for at least two different space relevant systems or subsystems (In-space applications are preferred, but terrestrial analogues will be considered). Consideration of at least 3 different fault modes. Software tools must be able to accept other systems or subsystems through appropriate interface. SBIR work is expected to deliver mainly software in the form of tools used during the design stage and also prototype software that would manage resiliency during autonomous operations. For the latter, the SBIR effort should analyze sensors, computational hardware, and software stack. Proposals must demonstrate mission operations risk reduction through appropriate metrics. Deliverables: tools developed, algorithms and any data generated in simulations or experiments.

Focus Area 3 Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration,H6.03Spacecraft Autonomous Agent Cognitive Architectures for Human Exploration, ARC," JSC, MSFC"," TA11 Modeling, Simulation, Information Technology and Processing", 2018,"This subtopic develops intelligent autonomous agent cognitive architectures that are open and modular such that they can feasibly be certified for use on deep space missions to interact both with the mission control operators, the crew, and most if not all of the spacecraft subsystems. With such a cognitive agent that has access to all onboard data and communications, the agent could continually integrate this dynamic information and advise the crew and mission control accordingly by multiple modes of interaction including text, speech, and animated images. This agent could respond to queries and recommend to the crew courses of action and direct activities that take into account all known constraints, the state of the systems, availability resources, risk analyses, and goal priorities. Future human spaceflight missions will place crews at long distances from Earth causing significant communication lag due to the light distance as well as occasional complete loss of communication with Earth. Novel artificial intelligence capabilities augmenting crews will be required for them to autonomously manage spacecraft operations and interact with Earth mission control under these conditions, including spacecraft and systems health, crew health, maintenance, consumable management, payload management, training, as well as activities such as food production and recycling. Autonomous agents with cognitive architectures would be able to interface directly with the crew as well as with the onboard systems and mission control, thus reducing the cognitive loads on the crew as well as performing many tasks that would otherwise require scheduling crew time. In addition, this cognitive computing capability is necessary in many circumstances to respond to off-nominal events that overload the crew; particularly when the event limits crew activity, such as high-radiation or loss of atmospheric pressure events. In deep space, crews will be required to manage, plan, and execute the mission more autonomously than is currently done on the International Space Station (ISS); which from Low Earth Orbit has instantaneous ground support. NASA expects to migrate significant portions of current operations functionality from Earth flight control to deep-space spacecraft to be performed autonomously. These functionalities will be performed jointly by the crew and cognitive agents supervised by the crew; so, the crew is not overburdened. Cognitive agents that can effectively communicate with the crew could perform tasks that would otherwise require crew time by providing assistance, directly operating spacecraft systems, providing training, performing inspections, and providing crew consulting among other tasks. Due to the complexity of such cognitive agents and the need for them to be continually updated, their software architecture is required to be modular. A requirement for these cognitive software architectures is that modules can dynamically be added, removed, and enhanced. Types of modules would likely include a smart executive, state estimator, planner/scheduler, diagnostics and prognostics, goal manager, etc. Other modules that may be supported include a dialog manager, risk manager, image recognition, instructional drawing, crew task manager, etc. This type of modular cognitive architecture is consistent with that proposed by Prof. Marvin Minsky in ""The Society of Mind"", 1988, and subsequent proposals and realizations of cognitive agents. Recent venues for cognitive architectures include: ICCM (http://iccm-conference.org/2017/(link is external)) and AAAI-17 Special Track on Special Track on Cognitive Systems http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2017/aaai17cognitive.php(link is external). Due to NASA's need for fail-safe capabilities, such as continued functionality during high-radiation events, the cognitive architecture will be required to be capable of supporting multiple processes executing on multiple processors, in order to meet the expected computational loads as well as be robust to processor failure. Cognitive architectures capable of being certified for crew support on spacecraft are also required to be open to NASA with interfaces open to NASA partners who develop modules that integrate with other modules on the cognitive agent in contrast to proprietary black-box agents. Note that a cognitive agent suitable to provide crew support on spacecraft may also be suitable for a variety of Earth applications, but the converse is not true; thus, requiring this NASA investment. The emphasis of proposed efforts is expected to be on analyzing and demonstrating the feasibility of various configurations, capabilities, and limitations of a cognitive architecture suitable for crew support on deep space missions. The software engineering of a cognitive architecture is to be documented and demonstrated by implementing a prototype goal-directed cognitive agent that interacts with simulated spacecraft systems and humans. For Phase I, a preliminary cognitive architecture, preliminary feasibility study, a cognitive agent prototype that supports a human operating a simulated complex system that illustrates a candidate cognitive agent architecture, and a detailed plan to develop a comprehensive cognitive architecture feasibility study are expected. For Phase II, it is expected that the proposed detailed feasibility study plan is executed. In Phase II it is expected that a comprehensive cognitive architecture will be generated, along with a demonstration of an agent prototype that instantiates the architecture. The agent prototype should interact with a spacecraft simulator and humans executing a plausible HEOMD design reference mission beyond cis-lunar (e.g., Human Exploration of Mars Design Reference Mission: https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/373665main_NASA-SP-2009-566.pdf). Phase II deliverables are also expected to include a comprehensive feasibility study report, and a detailed plan to develop a fully instantiated robust cognitive architecture suitable for proposing to NASA and other organizations interested in funding a flight capability. A Phase II prototype suitable for a compelling flight experiment or simulation interfacing with the ISS or a spacecraft-relevant robotic system is encouraged.

Focus Area 3 Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration,S5.05Fault Management Technologies, ARC," JPL, MSFC"," TA11 Modeling, Simulation, Information Technology and Processing", 2018,"As science missions are given increasingly complex goals and have more pressure to reduce operations costs, system autonomy increases. Fault Management (FM) is one of the key components of system autonomy. FM consists of the operational mitigations of spacecraft failures. It is implemented with spacecraft hardware, on-board autonomous software that controls hardware, software, information redundancy, and ground-based software and operations procedures. Many recent Science Mission Directorate (SMD) missions have encountered major cost overruns and schedule slips during test and verification of FM functions. These overruns are due to a lack of understanding of FM functions early in the mission definition cycles and to FM architectures that do not provide attributes of transparency, verifiability, fault isolation capability, or fault coverage. The NASA FM Handbook is under development to improve the FM design, development, verification and validation and operations processes. FM approaches, architectures, and tools are needed to improve early understanding of needed FM capabilities by project managers and FM engineers and to improve the efficiency of implementing and testing FM. Specific objectives are to: Improve the ability to predict FM system complexity and estimate development and operations costs. Enable cost-effective FM design architectures and operations. Determine completeness and appropriateness of FM designs and implementations. Decrease the labor and time required to develop and test FM models and algorithms. Improve visualization of the full FM design across hardware, software, and operations procedures. Determine extent of testing required, completeness of verification planned, and residual risk resulting from incomplete coverage. Increase data integrity between multi-discipline tools. Standardize metrics and calculations across FM, SE, S&MA and operations disciplines. Increase reliability of FM systems. Expected outcomes are better estimation and control of FM complexity and development costs, improved FM designs, and accelerated advancement of FM tools and techniques. The approach of this subtopic is to seek the right balance between sufficient reliability and cost appropriate to the mission type and risk posture. Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, SMD missions. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and NASA relevance during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration. Offerors should demonstrate awareness of the state-of-the-art of their proposed technology, and should leverage existing commercial capabilities and research efforts where appropriate. Specific technology in the forms listed below is needed to increase delivery of high quality FM systems. These approaches, architectures and tools must be consistent with and enable the NASA FM Handbook concepts and processes: FM Design Tools - System modeling and analyses significantly contributes to the quality of FM design; however, the time it takes to translate system design information into system models often decreases the value of the modeling and analysis results. Examples of enabling techniques and tools are modeling automation, spacecraft modeling libraries, expedited algorithm development, sensor placement analyses, and system model tool integration. FM Visualization Tools - FM systems incorporate hardware, software, and operations mechanisms. The ability to visualize the full FM system and the contribution of each mechanism to protecting mission functions and assets is critical to assessing the completeness and appropriateness of the FM design to the mission attributes (mission type, risk posture, operations concept, etc.). Fault trees and state transition diagrams are examples of visualization tools that could contribute to visualization of the full FM design. FM Operations Approaches - The goal of current FM processes is to preserve the asset, by safing the vehicle and relying on mission operations to determine how to proceed. But as greater autonomy is required - flying through failures in order to complete science objectives that require timely operations, for example – the spacecraft must be able to make decisions about how to recover from failures or degradations and continue the mission. FM designs must enable flexible operations that can integrate on-board and mission operations decision-making. FM Verification and Validation Tools - As complexity of spacecraft and systems increases, the extensiveness of testing required to verify and validate FM implementations can be resource intensive. Automated test case development, false positive/false negative test tools, model verification and validation tools, and test coverage risk assessments are examples of contributing technologies. FM Design Architectures - FM capabilities may be implemented through numerous system, hardware, and software architecture solutions. The FM architecture trade space includes options such as embedded in the flight control software or independent onboard software; on board versus ground-based capabilities; centralized or distributed FM functions; sensor suite implications; integration of multiple FM techniques; innovative software FM architectures implemented on flight processors or on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs); and execution in real-time or off-line analysis post-operations. Alternative architecture choices such as model-based approaches could help control FM system complexity and cost and could offer solutions to transparency, verifiability, and completeness challenges. Multi-discipline FM Interoperation - FM designers, Systems Engineering, Safety and Mission Assurance, and Operations perform analyses and assessments of reliabilities, failure modes and effects, sensor coverage, failure probabilities, anomaly detection and response, contingency operations, etc. The relationships between multi-discipline data and analyses are inconsistent and misinterpreted. Resources are expended either in effort to resolve disconnects in data and analyses or worse, reduced mission success due to failure modes that were overlooked. Solutions that address data integrity, identification of metrics, and standardization of data products, techniques and analyses will reduce cost and failures. All submissions must show how proposed technologies are relevant to SMD missions and objectives.

These ranges may be from extremely cold temperatures, such as cryogenic temperatures, to extremely high temperatures, such as those experienced near a rocket engine plume. Collected data must be time stamped to facilitate analysis with other collected data sets. Sensor systems should be self-contained to collect information and relay measurements through various means by a sensor-web approach to provide a self-healing, auto-configuring method of collecting data from multiple sensors, and relaying for integration with other acquired data sets. Sensor technologies shall be capable of measuring pressure and temperature with cryogenic and gaseous fluid flow within metal piping. Sensor systems should enable the ability to detect anomalies, determine causes and effects, predict future anomalies, and provides an integrated awareness of the health of the system to users (operators, customers, management, etc.). The proposed innovative systems must lead to improved safety, reduced test, and space flight costs by allowing for the real-time analysis of data, information, and knowledge through efficient interfaces to enable integrated awareness of the system condition by users.

Improving robot information technology is critical to improving the capability, flexibility, and performance of future NASA missions. In particular, the NASA ""Robotics and Autonomous Systems"" technology roadmap (T04) indicates that extensive and pervasive use of robots can significantly enhance future exploration missions that are progressively longer, complex, and operate with fewer ground control resources. The performance of space robots is directly linked to the quality and capability of the information technologies that are used to build and operate them. Thus, proposals are sought that address the following technology needs: Advanced robot user interfaces that facilitate distributed collaboration, geospatial data visualization, summarization and notification, performance monitoring, and physics-based simulation. The primary objective is to enable more effective and efficient interaction with robots remotely operated with discrete commands or supervisory control. Note: proposals to develop user interfaces for direct teleoperation (manual control) are not being solicited and will be considered non-responsive. Navigation systems for mobile robot (free-flying and wheeled) operations in man-made (inside the International Space-Station) and unstructured, natural environments (Earth, Moon, Mars). Emphasis on multi-sensor data fusion, obstacle detection, and localization. The primary objective is to radically and significantly increase the performance of mobile robot autonomous navigation through new sensors, avionics (including COTS processors for use in space), perception algorithms and software. Proposals for small size, weight, and power (SWAP) systems are particularly encouraged. Robot software systems that support system-level autonomy, instrument/sensor targeting, downlink data triage, and activity planning. The primary objective is to facilitate the creation, extensibility and maintenance of complex robot systems for use in the real-world.

NASA uses paper and electronic procedures to direct crew through complex maintenance procedures for all on-board systems. Developing and executing procedures are still time consuming and tedious tasks, and substantial training is needed to understand the technical details for troubleshooting defective components, and the performance of critical maintenance and repairs. X-R based technology systems could have the potential to support future human exploration missions by providing the type of guidance normally associated with an expert human trainer. The capabilities of envisioned future X-R based systems will augment the ability of the crew while being simple and highly intuitive to use. On board maintenance is one of the potential areas in which X-R technology can be a game changing technology.

This targeted call seeks unique combinations of mobile manipulation, defined as work systems able to position themselves and then perform work with limbs. This combination of mobility and manipulation is a technical challenge, with static manipulation systems or mobile systems poorly suited to perform work being more common. The intent for this subtopic is to stimulate new solutions to the challenges of mobile manipulation, capturing recent advances in robotics technology in numerous terrestrial sectors that are relevant to space exploration. Broader topics of interest include perception, mobility for extreme terrain, autonomous control, human-robot interaction and dexterous manipulation. Lunar surface challenges involve mobile manipulation in soft soils, extreme thermal conditions, and sustained periods of no or low communication with Earth. Challenges in lunar orbit involve mobile manipulation in zero gravity, positioning work systems for preventive maintenance, logistics handling and contingency operations of a dormant spacecraft with reduced communication. Human interaction with these robotic systems will be limited due to communication blackout periods and time delay, and must be optimized for both mobility phases and manipulation phases of work. These lunar missions require low mass, low power and low volume solutions. All command and control approaches for human interaction should assume limited communication capabilities, requiring supervision of autonomous systems. Surface systems must be robust despite challenges of dust and thermal cycles. Orbital systems must be safe around human crew members and able to work with spacecraft interfaces intended for humans.

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,H4.01Advanced Space Suit Portable Life Support System (PLSS), JSC," ARC, GRC, KSC, MSFC"," TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems", 2018,"NASA plans to continue using the current EMU/spacesuit for the life of ISS. However, with the anticipation of a replacement suit for ISS or other future mission, the plan for an Advanced EMU is underway. Technology gaps remain for the PLSS. The following is a list of technology focus areas specifically for the Advanced PLSS: Continuous trace contaminant removal capability - Activated charcoal is the state of the art and provides a logistics impact to future missions. The primary trace contaminants to remove include ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (CH2O), and methanethiol (also known as methyl mercaptan) (CH3SH). The minimum objective would be to remove all of the significant compounds that threaten to exceed the 7-day SMAC2 during an EVA. For continuous removal, the most advantageous integration with the current state of the art CO2/H2O removal system would be integrated such that regeneration or desorption occurs with a pressure swing from 4.3 psia to <1 torr over a ~2min period half-cycle at temperatures in the 60-80° F range. A small amount of heat flux is available from the cross-coupled adsorbing bed; additional heat input requirements from resistance heaters, etc. would negatively impact the system trade the more significant the value becomes. Small, oxygen compatible gas flow meter for suit operations - Small, oxygen compatible gas flow meter for suit operations: The current state of the art for flow measurement on the ISS EMU space suit is a flapper valve attached to a microswitch which is limited to a single set-point. The accurate measurement ranges required for the sensor are 2-8 acfm +/- 1% with a pressure drop of less than 0.68 in-H20 in a 100% oxygen (O2) environment (traces of NH3, H2O, CO2); suit pressure from 3.5-25 psia, temperature from 50-90° F, relative humidity (RH) 0-50%, and CO2 from 0-15mmHg. This flow meter needs to fit within a volume/shape factor of approximately 2.5 in x 1.5in x 3in or less including fluid ports and electrical connectors; if added as an in-line flow, 1 in inlet/outlet porting will be necessary. Operating life objective is 8 years without calibration and 5000 hours of powered operation. Small hermetic micro switch - Current state of the art is 3-5 times larger than needed. Honeywell MicroSwitch HM-1 series is a typical state of the art. Combining Single Pole Double Throw (SPDT) circuits that add additional toggle mechanisms would further grow the size of the switch. Hermetic is defined as leakage <10-8 atm-cc/sec. Switching currents for these switches are signal level at <500mA. Multi-gas monitoring within the suit -Multi-gas monitoring: Advanced suit could benefit from measuring Oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (CH2O), methanethiol (also known as methyl mercaptan) (CH3SH), etc. The measurement of trace contaminants becomes even more important if an alternate approach (e.g., pressure or temperature swing adsorption) to the traditional activated charcoal cartridge is used. There is a need to measure the following major constituents and trace contaminants ranges in the gas stream across a total pressure range of 3.5 – 23.5 psia and temperature range of 35-125F: O2 = 20-100%; CO2 = 0-30 torr over 3.5-23.5 psia; H2O = 5-90% RH; NH3 = 0-50 ppm; CO = 0-400 ppm; CH2O = 0-5 ppm; and CH3SH = 0-5 ppm. Power -Current state of the art is lithium-ion batteries with cell level energy densities of 200 W-h/kg but packaged energy densities of ~130W-h/kg after addressing mitigation for thermal runaway. Safe, high-energy density power sources are needed which are rechargeable post-EVA. Heat Transport Improvements - Several improvements are needed in this focus area including: Improvement in the Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment (LCVG) state of the art. Improvement in the UA such that warmer water can be used to sink the waste heat from the human and hence reduce the evaporator size. Drastically alter the human-to-cooling loop interfaces such as a fluid-filled suit with directly pumped cooled water. Alter the Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment (TMG) such that the emissivity/absorptivity can be dynamically altered to improve thermal. Human-Machine Interface Improvements - Current state of the art for this focus area includes mechanical switches and a 16 x 2 Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). Low power, wide thermal range, rad tolerant high definition graphics displays that can be integrated with the suit soft goods or hard goods such as heads-displays. These technology gaps were detailed during the 2017 SBIR/STTR Industry Day (https://sbir.nasa.gov/events/sbir-industry-day). Phase I Products - By the end of Phase, it would be beneficial to have a concept design for infusion into the Advanced PLSS. Testing of the concept is desired at this Phase. Phase II Products - By the end of Phase II, a prototype ready for system-level testing in the PLSS or in a representative loop of the PLSS is desired.

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,"H4.02Controllable, Tinting, Polycarbonate Compatible Coatings for Advanced EVA Spacesuit Visor", JSC," ARC, GRC, KSC, MSFC"," TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems", 2018,"For the next generation of NASA's space suits, being able to enable an architecture for microgravity and planetary capabilities is required. To support these future missions, we will need support hardware to be designed, such as a new extravehicular visor assembly (EVVA) to protect the astronaut’s eyes from the damaging UV rays of the sun. The EMU has an EVVA that is a sun visor that can be manually deployed by the crew members. This changes the radiation protection from just UV via the clear helmet to a reflective visor that blocks visible light and IR via the gold visor. Unlike the EMU EVVA design, the new EVVA will need to integrate with the exploration space suit helmet bubble, which is a 10”x13” hemi-ellipsoid dome. We feel that in this new design we have a unique opportunity to integrate the new technologies in the field of actively controlled coatings that affect tint-ability, UV protection, and optimized transmittance through our EVVA. Focus areas of coating technology that appeal to the team are electrochromics and solar variable reflectance, but we are open to other novel solutions. The goal at the end of Phase I SBIR is to have a tabletop prototype helmet bubble that is coated with a controllable tint that would demonstrate the technology needed to replace the EVVA reflective visor. Phase I Performance Targets: Transmittance requirements in off state: 450 nm N/A, 550 nm 70% min, 1100 N/A. Transmittance requirements in on state: 450 nm 10+/-4%, 550 16+/-4%, and 1100 nm 10% max. Cannot hinder visibility in a failed state. Must be thermally stable in the space environment. Concepts of how to make it operable with a gloved hand. If required, low power consumption. Phase II would require the coating to meet the same requirements as seen in Phase I, but to deliver a full helmet bubble prototype that could interface with NASA's Z-2 spacesuit for a suited demonstration. Examples of Phase II performance targets would include ability to autosense UV/light with the ability to turn on/off the coating automatically, integrating a scratch resistant coating, a packaged power supply (if needed) that is dust resistant and tolerant to the space environment, and packaged controls for the crew member that are operable with a gloved hand.

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,"H4.03Mass Produced, Minimal Capability, Disposable EVA Life Support System", JSC," ARC, GRC, KSC, MSFC"," TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems", 2018,"NASA’s plans for Exploration EVA Operational Concepts and Architectures currently lead to conceptual design solutions optimized for relatively long EVA’s and extensive re-use of the PLSS over the course of many missions. From an economics perspective, that is one way to solve the question of “value” – by amortizing the development and manufacturing cost of a relatively small amount of production units across a relatively long period of use (many years, many EVAs or many separate missions). However, it is possible that alternative ways of solving the Suit and PLSS problems, including cost, could be acceptable – by reducing the capability inside the EVA PLSS to a point where it might only enable a relatively short EVA (perhaps ~2 hours instead of ~8) and relatively few EVAs (perhaps ~10 instead of ~100) one might be able to construct a schematic and design that was affordably “mass produced”. Embracing innovative suit garment technologies and concepts such as novel material layups, self-healing/self-repair bladders and restraints, Shape Memory Alloy (for adjustable sizing and fit geometry, ballistic projectile mitigation (for secondary eject from MMOD strikes on nearby natural surfaces), electrochromics, Mechanical Counter Pressure (MCP) concepts, and hybrid designs and manufacturing approaches may lead to cost effective suits that could inform NASA future plans as well as support future commercial space needs. Ultimately, concepts, technologies and design solutions leading to the capability of “low-cost customization” is vital to NASA’s future exploration capabilities in many ways. The potential benefits of these approaches could include the ability to more regularly incorporate emerging technologies and minor feature updates to continuous reduction of cost through refinement and modernization of the production system. Such an approach might also stimulate or otherwise support the adoption of EVA as a viable, cost effective feature in commercial spaceflight systems for non-NASA customers. Design solutions might look significantly different from current/historic EVA PLSS and suit designs, including features similar to the emergency breathing systems used for short periods by firefighters, first responders and Hazardous Material teams. Parallels with such terrestrial applications offer opportunities for existing commercial product lines to be adapted or modified for the “hazardous environment” of EVA and could further grow existing sectors of the economy. Such innovative design solutions would also provide NASA technical data that NASA could then integrate into analysis of alternative “Mission Design” scenarios where the total spaceflight architectural impact of mass, volume, reliability, spares and contingency scenarios are assessed. These types of analysis currently only use the conventional PLSS design solution parameters as inputs, but running the same models by adapting Operational Concepts to use a “mass produced” EVA PLSS might reveal surprising alternative approaches that NASA should be aware of. Phase I products: A paper report on the concept highlighting the design’s minimal capabilities. A manufacturability analysis explaining why it is mass-producible at an extremely low cost (including an estimate of the number of units needed to achieve a minimal unit price). A comparison of the proposed concept with existing commercially available terrestrial life support systems such as firefighter breathing apparatus’: The comparison highlights commonality or differences in the technical design and the economies of scale found in available terrestrial life support systems and the proposed concept. This information should clearly support the manufacturability analysis by providing evidence to the costs of existing product lines and why those are relevant analogies to the proposal. Prototype suit subsystem manufacture, up to and including a full suit, which could be used in testing. Phase II would require the product development, further characterization of the limits of the design’s performance and additional financial analysis on the cost of mass production.

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,H6.01Integrated System Health Management for Sustainable Habitats, ARC," GRC, JSC, LaRC"," TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems", 2018,"Habitation systems provide a safe place for astronauts to live and work in space and on planetary surfaces. They enable crews to live and work safely in deep space, and include integrated life support systems, radiation protection, fire safety, and systems to reduce logistics and the need for resupply missions. Innovative health management technologies are needed in order to increase the safety and mission-effectiveness for future space habitats on other planets, asteroids, or lunar surfaces. For example, off-nominal or failure conditions occurring in safety-critical life support systems may need to be addressed quickly by the habitat crew without extensive technical support from Earth due to communication delays. If the crew in the habitat must manage, plan and operate much of the mission themselves, operations support must be migrated from Earth to the habitat. Enabling monitoring, tracking, and management capabilities on-board the habitat and related EVA platforms for a small crew to use will require significant automation and decision support software. This subtopic seeks to broaden the scope of traditional caution and warning systems, which are typically triggered by out-of-bounds sensor values, by including machine learning and data mining techniques. These methods aim to reveal latent, unknown conditions while still retaining and improving the ability to provide highly accurate alerts for known issues. The performance targets for known faults and failures will be based upon false alarm rate, missed detection rate, and detection time (first time prior to the adverse event that the algorithm indicates an impending fault/failure). Methods should explore the trade space for ISHM data and processing needs in order to provide guidance for future habitat sensor and computational resource requirements. Proposals may address specific system health management capabilities required for habitat system elements (life support systems, etc.). In addition, projects may focus on one or more relevant subsystems such as water recycling systems, photovoltaic systems, electrical power systems, and environmental monitoring systems. Proposals that involve the use of existing testbeds or facilities at one of the participating NASA centers (e.g., Sustainability Base at ARC) for technology validation, verification, and maturation are strongly encouraged. Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) of 4 to 6 or higher are sought. Key features of Sustainability Base that make it relevant to deep space habitat technology are its use of a grey water recycling system and a photovoltaic array. Data logged from other facility management/building automation systems include environmental data (temp, CO2, etc.) and facility equipment sensors (flowrates, differential pressures, temperatures, etc.). Also, information on power consumption (whole building, plug load, other loads metered at the panel/circuit level) can be made available. These remaining systems, while conventionally ""green,"" have no unique feature that can't be exclusively used for terrestrial purposes. However, the fact that all such systems require less power to support human occupancy can be used as a focal point to serve as a testbed for deep space habitats that will need to operate within finite energy budgets. Specific technical areas of interest related to integrated systems health management include the following: Machine learning and data mining techniques that are capable of learning from operations data to identify statistical anomalies that may represent previously unknown system degradations. Methods should facilitate the incorporation of human feedback on the operational significance of the statistical anomalies using techniques such as active learning. Demonstration of advanced predictive capability using machine learning or data mining methods for known system fault or failure modes, within prescribed performance constraints related to detection time and accuracy. Prognostic techniques able to predict system degradation, leading to system robustness through automated fault mitigation and improved operational effectiveness. Proposals in this area should focus on systems and components commonly found in space habitats or EVA platforms. Innovative human-system integration methods that can convey a wealth of health and status information to mission support staff quickly and effectively, especially under off-nominal and emergency conditions.

It is critical that a produce disinfection method be identified to prevent foodborne illness. A water wash method would impact vehicle design, and requirements must be determined in time to inform transit vehicle designs. The Pro-San wipes currently used to disinfect space-grown produce require continual up-mass and create trash. Other novel methods that have been investigated, including hydrogen peroxide and cold plasma chambers, generated a noticeable quality reduction during disinfection. Crewmembers will be harvesting and processing produce themselves, and it is imperative that quality is not reduced during disinfection. Some examples of items of interest: Development of a water wash system that can directly integrate in a closed loop with the spacecraft water system. Use of food grade sanitizers. No soaps or detergents. Residuals should not exceed approved food amounts. Systems that disinfect and dry a range of fruit and vegetable amounts (0.25 - 2 kg) and types (leafy greens, tomatoes, radishes, green peppers) in both microgravity and reduced gravity environments. Proposals that use the least amount of crew time (both active and passive) will be given greater consideration. Proposals that use the least amount of water for both disinfecting and rinsing will be given greater consideration. Note, crew currently receive less than 3 L of water a day each for consumption. Demonstrate greater than a 3 log reduction in Aerobic Plate Count, Yeast and Mold, and both Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, a common contaminant on fresh produce, and in Escherichia coli ATCC 11775, a non-pathogen used as a surrogate for other gram negative organisms that have been associated with foodborne illness. Demonstrate that produce quality is not noticeably reduced from the beginning of the process to the end. Systems that are lowest in mass, power, volume, crew time, etc. will be given greater consideration. Reliability; capable of operation for up to 2-5 years and withstand launch loads and gravity changes.

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,T7.01Advanced Bioreactor Development for In Situ Microbial Manufacturing, ARC," ARC, MSFC", TA7 Human Exploration Destination Systems, 2018,"NASA's future long-duration missions require a high degree of materials recovery and recycling as well as the ability to manufacture required mission resources in situ. While physico-chemical methods offer potential advantages for the production of many products, biological systems are able to manufacture a wide range of materials that are not yet possible with abiotic systems. Microbial systems are currently being developed by academic institutions, industry, and government agencies to produce a wide array of products that are applicable to space missions. Relevant mission resources include, but are not limited to, food, nutrients, pharmaceuticals, polymers, fuels and various chemicals. While current space-based research involves engineering of organisms to produce targeted compounds as well as the in-situ production of microbial media to support larger scale operations, additional enabling research is needed to develop specialized bioreactors that are highly efficient, reliable, low volume and mass, and that otherwise meet the unique rigors of space. Advanced bioreactor research and development has been primarily focused on terrestrial applications, particularly pharmaceutical, food and chemical production systems. Some space bioreactor work regarding flight experiments and life support applications has been conducted, such as algal reactors for CO2/O2 management. However, little to no effort has been conducted on the bioreactor design and operations that are required to enable in-situ microbial manufacturing. Therefore, innovations are sought to provide: Bioreactors that minimize mass, power and volume, maintenance, process inputs and waste production. Bioreactors that are capable of operating on the surface of Mars or potentially in-flight scenarios. Bioreactors that incorporate novel microbial biomass separation/harvesting/purification methods, materials recycling/recovery and ease of cleaning.

Advanced bioreactor monitoring and control systems, including oxygen, temperature, pH, nutrients. Experimental bioreactors that exhibit the ability to scale upwards. Bioreactors that maximize reliability, component miniaturization, materials handling ability, gas management and overall performance. Overall, proposals should focus on advancing bioreactor development for space applications, rather than the production of a particular product or microorganism. The Phase I STTR deliverable should include a Final Report that captures any scientific results and processes as well as details on the technology identified. The Final Report should also include a Feasibility Study which defines the current technology readiness level and proposes the maturation path for further evolution of the system.

Other potential deliverables include bioreactor system designs, hardware components and prototypes, and system control approaches and software.

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,T7.02Space Exploration Plant Growth, KSC, JSC, TA7 Human Exploration Destination Systems, 2018,"Producing food for crew consumption is an important goal for achieving Earth independence and reducing the logistics associated with future exploration missions. NASA seeks innovative technologies to enable plant growth systems for food production for in-space and planetary exploration missions. Regolith to Soil - Cultivation of crops for a Mars surface mission could be done hydroponically, or in combination with solid media generated from mineral regolith found near the landing site. NASA is interested in testing and developing concepts for generating ""soil"" media from Mars-like regolith to support food crop growth and allow uptake of essential minerals. Consideration should be given to improving water and nutrient retention characteristics, and remediation of potentially toxic perchlorate compounds common to Mars regolith. CO2 Control for Plant Chambers - More advanced plant chambers for space typically manage their internal atmosphere separately, which allows recycling of transpired humidity. But this requires the use of consumable, compressed CO2 sources for controlling the plant chamber. Cabin air typically has high CO2 levels and technologies are sought to scavenge or adsorb cabin CO2 from cabin air and allow careful, controlled additions of the CO2 to the plant chamber. Cultivation and Growth Systems - Spacecraft systems are constrained to utilize minimal volume and require minimal crew time for management and operation. Future systems may even require autonomous start-up and operation prior to crew arrival. NASA seeks innovative systems for plant growth and cultivation that are volume efficient, flexible for a range of plant types and sizes (examples: tomatoes, wheat, beans, and potatoes). Technologies should be adaptive for the entire life cycle (from seeding, to managing plant growth and spacing, through harvest), and reusable across multiple harvests. Concepts need to address integration with watering and nutrient/fertilizer systems (whether soil/media based, hydroponic, or aeroponic). Systems should address whether they are microgravity compatible, surface gravity compatible, or both. Read less>>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Focus Area 7 Human Research and Health Maintenance,H12.01Radioprotectors and Mitigators of Space Radiation-induced Health Risks, LaRC, JSC," TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems", 2018,"Space radiation is a significant obstacle to sending humans on long duration missions beyond low earth orbit. NASA is concerned with the health risks to astronauts following exposures to galactic cosmic rays (GCR), the high-energy particles found outside Earth’s atmosphere. Astronaut health risks from GCR are categorized into cancer, late and early central nervous systems (CNS) effects, and degenerative risks, which includes cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (see references below for more detail). This subtopic is for biological countermeasures to minimize or prevent adverse health effects from space radiation: chronic, low dose, low dose-rate, mixed field (high LET and low LET) and mission relevant doses (0.25 to 0.5 Gy). Radioprotectors or mitigators are needed that can target common pathways (e.g., inflammation) across cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration. The focus of this subtopic will be to address CVD and late CNS effects through a medical countermeasure that can provide cross-risk mitigation (addressing both CVD and CNS late effects). This subtopic will consider: FDA approved drugs. FDA Off-label usage drugs. FDA IND Status drugs. Biological countermeasures under development for acute radiation syndrome or prevention of secondary radiation-induced diseases from radiation therapy may be ideal for this topic and allow the company to expand its product line to space radiation, carbon ion therapy and ground based late effects from nuclear fallout. Additionally, countermeasures must be acceptable for use as a radioprotectant in an otherwise healthy population with consideration given to safety, risks, and benefits of possible long-term usage over the course of a mission and/or post mission timeframe. Benefits should clearly outweigh risks. The biological countermeasure criteria: Medical products and regimens that prevent and/or mitigate adverse health effects due to space radiation with emphasis on broad activity (i.e., multi-tissue). Mechanism of action well known. Independent of sex. Capable of being delivered chronically for the period of the mission (potentially up to 3 years). Easily administered; capable of self-administration (e.g., Oral, inhaled). Known/potential benefits greater than known potential risks; minimal adverse events. No contraindications with other drugs used for treating other symptoms or diseases during the mission. Long shelf-life. Phase I will test radioprotectors or mitigators using mixed radiation fields that must include a low LET source such as gamma combined with high LET radiation such as neutrons or alpha particles to determine efficacy in mixed fields at space relevant doses. This testing can be done at the location of choice. Companies should provide a test plan that will demonstrate the compound being proposed provides protection or mitigation of radiation-induced injury for normal tissues and does not protect cancer cells. A kickoff meeting with NASA is mandatory prior to the start of this award. Phase II will test effective radioprotectors or mitigators in space radiation simulated environments (HZE) to determine if they are able to minimize or prevent late effects directly related to the development of neurodegeneration or cardiovascular disease. Companies should provide a test plan for in vivo evaluation that describes the expected effect from the compound. Access and funding to support testing in space radiation simulated facilities will be provided for Phase II in addition to the standard award.

Focus Area 7 Human Research and Health Maintenance,H12.03Crew Worn Accelerometers in spaceflight environment, ARC," GRC, JPL, KSC, LaRC, MSFC"," TA6 Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems", 2018,"NASA needs an all-in-one data collection system to record crewmember dynamics and kinematics during dynamic phases of flight including launch, pad or ascent abort, atmospheric reentry, descent, and landing. These phases of Soyuz and Commercial vehicle flights are of particular interest due to the sustained vibration (launch), sustained accelerations (launch and reentry), transient accelerations (aborts, descent and landing), and rotational velocities (abort, descent and landing). The sensors must: Be self-powered with non-volatile memory (onboard data storage). Be able to collect at least 30 minutes of data in a 5-hour time span of launch (including time on the pad). Be able to sustain the stresses of launch and then be powered off for 6 months to 1 year (with the possibility of charging and off-loading launch data while in-flight). Be capable of collecting ≥1 hour of data in at least an 8-hour period during entry, descent, and landing (including loiter time). Have a customizable trigger based on timing or acceleration sensing. Be capable of accurately measuring and storing linear accelerations and angular velocities with sufficient temporal resolution to capture the relevant dynamics in each event (linear X, Y, Z axis; ±200g range, 0-3000Hz bandwidth, 10,000 Hz sampling rate; angular X & Z - ±2,000 rad/sec range, 0-300 Hz bandwidth, 5,000 Hz sampling rate, Y - ±5,000 rad/sec range, 0-300 Hz bandwidth, 5,000 Hz sampling rate). Be crew-worn without interfering with other crew-worn equipment. Meet SAE J211-1 and SAE J2570 specifications. The data collected will be used to quantify crew loading during each phase of flight and improve NASA’s ability to predict dynamic environments through the use of numerical simulation and models. Such sensors could be used to quantify crewmember head and neck dynamics, chest kinematics, and helmet kinematics in relation to the head and neck. These data have not been previously collected during spaceflight and are important to understanding how humans respond to the unique dynamics present in the spaceflight environment.

Focus Area 8 In-Situ Resource Utilization,H1.01Mars Atmosphere ISRU for Mission Consumables, JSC," ARC, GRC, JPL, KSC, MSFC", TA7 Human Exploration Destination Systems, 2018,"In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) involves collecting and converting local resources into products that can be used to reduce mission mass, cost, and/or risk of human exploration. ISRU products that provide significant mission benefits with minimal infrastructure required are propellants, fuel cell reactants, and life support consumables. Production of mission consumables from in-situ Mars resources is enabling and critical for human exploration of the Mars surface and for minimizing the number and size of landers and the crew ascent vehicle. Innovative technologies and approaches are sought related to ISRU processes associated with collecting, separating, pressurizing, and processing gases collected from the Mars atmosphere. State of the art (SOA) technologies for these ISRU processes either do not exist, are too small of scale, or are too complex, heavy, inefficient, or consume too much power. Specific areas of technology interest include the following: Mars Atmosphere Collection and Separation: Inlet Gas Dust Measurement - To understand both the dust concentration before filtration as well as the effectiveness of dust filtration techniques, NASA is interested in a dust sensor to measure dust particles in the Mars atmosphere acquired for processing. Measurements need to be made in a flow of carbon dioxide (CO2) up to 2.5 SLPM at Mars atmosphere pressure. The measurement technique should produce minimal modifications to the flow. The dust sensor needs to discriminate over a minimum of three particle sizing bins from 0.1 to 5.0 micron and detect particle concentrations from a few to hundreds of particles per cubic centimeter. The sensor needs to provide an analog or digital output to allow for remote monitoring and storage of particle counting data. Rapid Cycle Adsorption Pump (RCAP) - This process operates through adsorption and desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2). The cycle time between absorption and desorption should be in terms of minutes to minimize adsorption material mass. To achieve this, the proposal must include the thermal management system to perform the adsorption/desorption cycle with a minimum of thermal energy loss. The proposals also must consider all the valving and an active flow device to move the Mars atmosphere through the unit during the CO2 adsorption cycle. CO2 Freezing including active cooling (direct cryocooler or cryogenic fluid loop) and thermal management of freezing/heating that minimizes overall electrical energy - Active cooling is required to achieve a minimum of −123° C (150) K during the freezing process. The design must state and withstand pressures potentially up to 1000 psi during CO2 feeding. Cryocooler for in-house NASA design that operates at 150 K with a thermal lift in the 200-300 W range - The cold fingers and flanges must be capable of 1000 psi to handle the liquid CO2 pressures. The cryocooler would also need to be able to operate under Mars conditions with cooling supplied by the lander system. Separation and storage of nitrogen (N2) from Mars atmosphere - Two options can be considered. Option one is separation of N2 after the CO2 has been removed at Mars atmosphere pressures based on the use of RCAP or CO2 Freezing. Option two is separation of N2 after the Mars atmosphere has been compressed up to 517 KPa (75 psi). Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Processing: Microchannel Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) - The technology must demonstrate a CO2 conversion efficiency to >50% in a single pass before any separation and recirculation occurs. The technology proposed should include inlet/outlet gas heat exchange and reactor thermal management to minimize thermal energy losses. The proposer needs to define the design and performance aspects associated with operating pressures ranging from a nominal pressure of 103 KPa (15 psi) up to 517 KPa (75 psi). Solid Oxide Electrolysis (SOE) - The technology must demonstrate a temperature ramp rate of >15° C/min. and redox stable electrodes for the production durations and rates below. The technology must be able to electrolyze dry CO2, water (H2O), or a combination of both CO2 and H2O. The proposer needs to define the design and performance aspects associated with operating pressures ranging from a nominal pressure of 55 KPa (8 psi) up to 103 KPa (15 psi), and the design impact associated with differential pressures from inside to outside and across the electrolyte during different phases of operation. In Phase I the technology must demonstrate ≥ 20 thermal cycles, and ≥ 70 thermal cycles for Phase II. The technology proposed should include thermal management of the SOE stack and inlet/outlet gas heat exchange to minimize thermal energy losses. Information and performance of the proposed technology in a second application as a fuel cell using previously produced oxygen and carbon monoxide is also of interest to NASA. Alternative O2 from CO2 conversion technologies - Besides RWGS and SOE, NASA is interested in alternative CO2 conversion technologies as well. These technologies must exhibit >50% CO2 to CO conversion in single pass, and the proposer must clearly state benefits in mass, power, volume, operating life, and/or complexity compared to RWGS or SOE. Separation and recirculation of CO2 from CO2/CO streams - Most O2 to CO conversion processes have a significant amount of unreacted CO2 in the exhaust stream after a single pass. NASA is interested in technologies that allow the unreacted CO2 to be separated and recirculated back to the process inlet. RWGS and SOE reactors operate at high temperatures (>650° C) so exhaust gases may be at high temperature. The proposal must include both the recirculation pump and separation technologies required for the separation and recirculation system and define the temperatures, pressures, and separation efficiencies associated with these technologies. Regenerable gas drying - Oxygen and methane (CH4) produced from Mars CO2 must be dried before it is liquefied and stored. Also, hydrogen (H2) from water electrolysis must be dried before delivery to fuel/chemical production reactors. NASA is interested in regenerable gas drying technologies that can remove water from O2, H2, and CH4 streams. No service should be required for these units prior to completion of the ISRU plants operation. Recuperation of the removed water for subsequent use is highly desired. Humidity Sensor for dry oxygen and methane - Oxygen and methane produced from Mars CO2 must be dried before it is liquefied and stored. NASA is interested in technologies for water vapor sensing down to 20 ppmv of water in oxygen and methane streams. Dehydration resistant Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) for water electrolysis and gas/water separators - ISRU plants sent to Mars may be required to be for launch and during the cruise and landing phases before the system is activated. NASA is interested in dehydration resistant PEM materials for water electrolyzers and gas/water vapor separator membranes to allow for long term dry storage and delivery of ISRU systems. Technology work in Phase I and hardware to be delivered at the conclusion of Phase II will be designed and built to operate under lunar polar shadowed crater and/or Mars surface environmental conditions, so thermal management during operation of the proposed technology will need to be specified in the Phase I proposal. ISRU technologies for Mars missions must operate continuously (day and night) for very long durations (480 days) and at all possible atmosphere pressures, 700 to 1000 Pa (0.1 to 0.14 psi) and surface temperatures, which may reach a high of about 20° C (293 K) at noon, at the equator, to a low of about −153° C (120 K) at the poles, with the potential for significant temperature differences between day and night depending on the season and latitude. The total production rate for initial human missions to Mars for ascent propellant are 2.2 kg/hour for O2 production alone and 2.7 kg/hour oxygen and 0.68 hg/hour of methane for oxygen and fuel production. This correlates to approximately needing 6.6 kg/hr CO2 for O2 only and 2 kg/hr for O2/CH4 production. Since carbon dioxide processing may occur between 55 and 517 KPa (8 and 75 psi) and nominally at 103 KPa (15 psi) depending on the processing technology selected, proposers must state how the technology proposed changes in mass, power, volume, and complexity as a function of CO2 delivery and process operating pressure. Proposers are allowed to consider the use of multiple units to achieve these production rates, but should justify the number of units proposed based on overall mass, power, thermal, and/or operation duration requirements. Power needed for the proposed technology operation should be differentiated between electrical and thermal, and consideration should be given on how the thermal management system and the Mars environment could minimize the need for electrical-to-thermal energy conversion. Proposals will be evaluated on mass, power, volume, complexity, and technical feasibility. Read less>>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Focus Area 8 In-Situ Resource Utilization,H2.01Lunar Resources, KSC," GRC, JPL, JSC", TA7 Human Exploration Destination Systems, 2018,"Whereas the Moon was once thought to be dry, more recent discoveries indicate that there are a variety of resources that exist on the Moon in an embedded or frozen state in the regolith. When acquired and exposed to higher temperatures and vacuum, these resources will change state into the vapor phase and are known as volatiles. Examples are polar water ice or Hydrogen and Helium 3 embedded in the regolith grains by the sun. Lunar volatiles are a meaningful first focus area for a space exploration strategy because: Use of local space resources, including lunar volatiles, for propellant, life support, etc. will improve the sustainability of human space exploration. Technologies and methods for accessing lunar volatiles are relevant to potential future Mars resource utilization. Volatiles are of great interest to the science community and provide clues to help understand the solar wind, comets, and the history of the inner solar system. NASA is interested in this proposal solicitation for small payloads up to 5 kg in mass which are needed to characterize and map the lunar volatiles resources, so that they can be included in a future lunar ISRU strategy, as listed in selective NASA Strategic Knowledge Gaps (SKG) below. This payload may be delivered to the surface of the Moon on a small commercial lunar lander and could be stationary on the lander, mobile on a mobility device, or it may itself be mobile and/or deployable. The Phase I proposal shall indicate the type of lunar surface assets, interfaces and commodities that are required to carry and support the payload. Impactors and other devices that are used or released in lunar orbit are not within the scope of this solicitation. The goal of this subtopic is to develop the technologies necessary for small payloads delivered to the Moon on a commercial lander to characterize and map the lunar volatiles resources. All proposals need to identify the state-of-the-art of applicable technologies and processes and Technology Readiness Level (TRL) expected at the end of Phase I, with a credible development plan. By the end of Phase I, feasibility of the proposed payload technology should be established with a notional payload packaging concept and evidence that the payload is feasible. If a Phase II is awarded, then further development of the payload technologies and payload packaging shall be required, including a payload prototype delivered to NASA at the end of the two-year project with a goal of achieving TRL 6. Due to the fact that lunar volatiles primarily exist in permanently shadowed craters, the prototype hardware proposed will need to operate under lunar vacuum conditions and either need to be designed to operate and be tested at extremely low temperatures (down to 40 K) or include estimates on thermal management and power to operate under these temperatures. Methods to collect the volatiles without significant loss to sublimation are of high interest. Proposals for innovative technologies and processes must include the design and test of critical attributes or high-risk areas associated with the proposed payload technology or process to achieve the objectives of potential SBIR Phase II proposed Lunar payload hardware. At the end of Phase II, successful payload designs will be considered for funding applied to a commercial lunar lander flight in a potential Phase III award. Proposals will be evaluated on the basis of feasibility, mass, power, volume, and complexity. All proposals shall identify the SKG(s) from the list below that will be met. Payloads with a proposed mass of greater than 5 kg shall not be considered in this subtopic. The following information is provided so proposers understand the context and purpose of the small payloads being solicited for a robotic lunar landing mission. Recent data from NASA's Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS), and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) missions indicate that as much as 20% of the material kicked up by the LCROSS impact was volatiles, including water, methane, ammonia, hydrogen gas, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. The instruments also discovered relatively large amounts of light metals such as sodium, mercury and possibly even silver. The following criteria are relevant to this SBIR solicitation, as reported by the Lunar Exploration Analysis Group (LEAG): Significant uncertainties remain regarding to the distribution of volatiles at the 10 to 100 m resolution scales accessible to near term orbital missions. Data and models are clear that volatiles are distributed unevenly at this scale and mission success scenarios should accommodate this likelihood. We also found that a range of new orbital missions and science support activities could reduce this risk by improving both the empirical data upon which site selections are based upon, and the scientific understanding of polar volatile evolution. Regarding landed experiments, there are several key measurements-- such as compositional variation and soil geotechnical and thermal properties--within the capabilities of small near-term missions that would greatly improve the understanding of polar volatiles; obtaining any of the needed quantities would benefit subsequent missions. There are sufficient data to support near-term landing site selections – Enhanced hydrogen is widespread across the polar regions and is sometimes concentrated in permanently shadowed regions (PSRs). Data show that average annual surface temperatures below 110K are also widespread, including both PSRs and areas sometimes illuminated. This characteristic allows preservation of shallow buried ice for geologic time. LCROSS demonstrated hydrogen and water do occur at shallow depths at the LCROSS target site PSR. However, arguments derived from lunar surface processes suggest volatiles will be distributed irregularly and high water abundance observed by LCROSS was not consistent with the regional H abundance indicating sampling of a local concentration. The expected patchy nature of hydrogen distributions constitutes significant risk to missions requiring detection and sampling of hydrogen. Higher resolution definitive hydrogen data would reduce this risk. LEAG Volatiles Specific Action Team (SAT) Landed Measurements Finding #1 Small near-term missions can provide critical data to resolve important unknowns regarding polar volatile science and resource utilization: Lateral and vertical distribution of volatiles. Chemical phases that contain volatile elements. Geotechnical and thermal properties of polar soils. Mobility of volatiles and associated timescale(s). Landed experiments obtaining any of the important quantities are of great science and exploration value. LEAG Volatiles Specific Action Team (SAT) Landed Measurements Finding #2 Early characterization of the variation in volatile abundance at ISRU and scientifically relevant spatial scales would greatly benefit all future missions: Current understanding of the spatial variation of volatile abundance at the scale of landers and small rovers is a major uncertainty. This ignorance is a strong inhibitor for the use of static landers. Several studies suggest that near surface volatiles will be very unevenly distributed due to the impact process and other mechanisms. A small rover traversing several hundred meters could characterize the variation in volatiles at this scale with simple instrumentation. A rover traverse of several hundred meters to several kilometers is required. The minimum distance for ground truthing is 20 km. Minimum distance to confirm if there are volatiles present is likely to be ~1 km. This would provide ground-truth for orbital volatile measurements by beginning to close the gap in scales. LEAG Volatiles Specific Action Team (SAT) Landed Measurements Finding #3 The physical and chemical forms of abundant volatile elements are critical to understanding the resource and its origins: Early measurements should include unambiguous determination of the chemical phase of volatiles present to a depth of one or more meters. Measurements should not be restricted to the detection of water, but include other volatile species. Profiling is desirable, but a bulk analysis would be of very high value. It is necessary to measure the isotopic composition of volatile elements. Both with respect to fundamental volatile science and with respect to assessing quantitatively potential landing-induced contamination of the surface materials. LEAG Volatiles Specific Action Team (SAT) Landed Measurements Finding #4 Successful exploitation of in-situ resources requires knowledge of the physical (geotechnical) and thermal properties of polar regolith in addition to the volatile abundance: The utility of a resource is highly dependent on the cost of extraction that is in turn dependent on the physical and chemical state of the volatile and its refractory matrix. The ISRU community should develop specific measurement objectives for geotechnical and temperature dependent properties. Thermal analysis of polar soils such as differential scanning calorimetry would greatly enhance the ability to develop ISRU regolith processing strategies, even in a volatile poor polar target: Thermal analysis can also be made sensitive to volatiles found in the LCROSS plume that could cause significant concerns for contamination and degradation of ISRU hardware including H2S, Hg, and Na. Physical and thermal properties of polar regolith should be measured. The potential effect of some volatile compounds such as Hg and Na on instrument degradation should be quantified. LEAG Volatiles Specific Action Team (SAT) Landed Measurements Finding #8 In addition to ISRU goals, landed experiments should include measurements of current volatile flux to aid understanding volatile transport mechanism: Apollo surface experiments revealed a dynamic exosphere and produced a lengthy list of potential volatile atmospheric species. Measurements might include: Pressure. Atmospheric species. Flux directions. Measurements at PSR contacts to measure the volatile flux into cold traps.

"Focus Area 9 Sensors, Detectors and Instruments",S1.01Lidar Remote Sensing Technologies, LaRC," GSFC, JPL"," TA8 Science Instruments, Observatories & Sensor Systems", 2018,"NASA recognizes the potential of lidar technology in meeting many of its science objectives by providing new capabilities or offering enhancements over current measurements of atmospheric and topographic parameters from ground, airborne, and space-based platforms. To meet NASAs requirements for remote sensing from space, advances are needed in state-of-the-art lidar technology with an emphasis on compactness, efficiency, reliability, lifetime, and high performance. Innovative lidar subsystem and component technologies that directly address the measurement of atmospheric constituents and surface topography of the Earth, Mars, the Moon, and other planetary bodies will be considered under this subtopic. Compact, high-efficiency lidar instruments for deployment on unconventional platforms, such as balloon, small sat, and CubeSat are also considered and encouraged. Proposals must show relevance to the development of lidar instruments that can be used for NASA science-focused measurements or to support current technology programs. Meeting science needs leads to four primary instrument types: Backscatter - Measures beam reflection from aerosols to retrieve the opacity of a gas. Ranging - Measures the return beams time-of-flight to retrieve distance. Doppler - Measures wavelength changes in the return beam to retrieve relative velocity. Differential absorption - Measures attenuation of two different return beams (one centered on a spectral line of interest) to retrieve concentration of a trace gas. Phase I research should demonstrate technical feasibility and show a path toward a Phase II prototype unit.

"Focus Area 9 Sensors, Detectors and Instruments",S1.09Cryogenic Systems for Sensors and Detectors, GSFC," ARC, JPL, MSFC"," TA8 Science Instruments, Observatories & Sensor Systems", 2018,"Cryogenic cooling systems often serve as enabling technologies for detectors and sensors flown on scientific instruments as well as advanced telescopes and observatories. As such, technological improvements to cryogenic systems further advance the mission goals of NASA through enabling performance (and ultimately science gathering) capabilities of flight detectors and sensors. There are four potential investment areas that NASA is seeking to expand state of the art capabilities for possible use on future programs such as the Europa Jupiter System Science missions (http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/podcasting/jpl-europa20090218.html), and flagship missions under consideration for the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey (http://cor.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/PCOS_facility_missions_report_final.pdf). The topic areas are: Cryocooler Systems and Components: Miniaturized/Efficient Cryocooler Systems - Cryocooler systems are sought for application on SmallSat and small low power instrument space platforms. Present state-of-the-art capabilities provide 0.4 W of cooling at 77 K with approximately 5 W input power, while rejecting heat at 300 K, and having a system mass of 400 grams. Desired performance specifications for cryocoolers include a cooling capability on the order of 0.2 W at a temperature of approximately 30 K. For application on missions to outer planets, cryocoolers are needed with a cooling power of 0.3 W at approximately 35 K, with a heat rejection temperature as low as 150 K. Desired masses and input powers in both cases are < 400 grams and < 5W respectively. Component level improvements are also desirable. Low Temperature/High Efficiency Cryocoolers - High efficiency, multi-stage coolers with a low temperature stage capable of reaching 4 to 10 K will be needed for future astrophysics missions. Current state-of-the-art coolers include a device providing 0.04 W at 4.5 K and another providing 0.09 W at 6 K. Cryocoolers are sought that provide higher cooling power, for example >0.3 W at 10 K and ~ 200 mW at 4 K, with high efficiency. Devices that produce extremely low vibration, particularly at frequencies below a few hundred Hz are of special interest. Component level improvements are also desirable. Cryogenic/Rad-Hard Accelerometers - Accelerometers that can operate at 150 K, withstand a 0.01 Tesla magnetic field and are radiation hard to mega-rad level doses are needed for cryocooler control and monitoring in missions to outer planets. Sub-Kelvin Cooling Systems: Magnetic Cooling Systems - Sub-Kelvin cooling systems include Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerators (ADRs) and Active Magnetic Regenerative Refrigerators (AMRRs). The ADR in the Soft X-ray Spectrometer instrument on the Hitomi mission represents the state of the art in sub-Kelvin cooling systems for space application. Future missions requiring sub-Kelvin coolers will need devices that provide lower operating temperature (<50 mK), higher (preferably 100%) duty cycle, higher heat rejection temperature (preferably > 10K), higher overall system efficiency, and lower mass. Improvements at the component level are needed to achieve these goals. Specific components sought include: Compact, lightweight, low current superconducting magnets capable of producing a field of at least 4 Tesla while operating at a temperature of at least 10 K, and preferably above 15 K. Desirable properties include: A high engineering current density, preferably > 300 Amp/mm2. A field/current ratio of >0.33 Tesla/Amp, and preferably >0.66 Tesla/Amp. Low hysteresis heating. Lightweight Active/Passive magnetic shielding (for use with 4 Tesla magnets) with low hysteresis and eddy current losses, and low remanence. Heat switches with on/off conductance ratio > 3 104 and actuation time of <10 s. Materials are also sought for gas gap heat switch shells: these are tubes with extremely low thermal conductance below 1 K; they must be impermeable to helium gas, have high strength, including stability against buckling, and have an inner diameter > 20 mm. High cooling power density magnetocaloric materials, especially single crystals with volume > 20 cm3. Superconducting leads (10K - 90K) capable of 10 A operation with 1 mW conduction. 10 mK- 300 mK high resolution thermometry. Proposals considered viable for Phase I award will seek to validate hypotheses through proof of concept testing at relevant temperatures.

Atom interferometers exploit the quantum mechanical wave nature of atomic particles and quantum gases for sensitive interferometric measurements. Ground-based laboratory experiments and instruments have already demonstrated beyond the state of the art performances of accelerometer, gyroscope, and gravity measurements. The microgravity environment in space provides opportunities for further drastic improvements in sensitivity and precision. Such inertial sensors will have great potential to provide new capabilities for NASA Earth and planetary gravity measurements, for spacecraft inertial navigation and guidance, and for gravitational wave detection and test of properties of gravity in space. Currently the most mature development of atom interferometers as measurement instruments are those based on light pulsed atom interferometers with freefall cold atoms. There remain a number of technical challenges to infuse this technology in space applications. Some of the identified key challenges are (but not limited to): Compact high flux ultra-cold atom sources for free space atom interferometers (Example: >1x106 total useful free-space atoms, <1 nK, Rb, K, Cs, Yb, Sr, and Hg.

Ultra-high vacuum technologies that allow completely sealed, non-magnetic enclosures with high quality optical access and the base pressure maintained <1x10-9 torr. Consideration should be given to the inclusion of cold atom sources of interest. Beyond the state-of-the-art photonic components at wavelengths for atomic species of interest, particularly at NIR and visible: efficient acousto-optic modulators (low RF power d ~ 200 mW, low thermal distortion, ~80% or greater diffraction efficiency); efficient electro-optic modulators (low bias drift, residual AM, and return loss, fiber-coupled preferred), miniature optical isolators (~30 dB isolation or greater, ~ -2 dB loss or less), robust high-speed high-extinction shutters (switching time < 1 ms, extinction > 60 dB are highly desired). Flight qualifiable lasers or laser systems of narrow linewidth, high tunability, and/or higher power for clock and cooling transitions of atomic species of interest. Cooling and trapping lasers: 10 kHz linewidth and ~ 1 W or greater total optical power. Compact clock lasers: 5x10-15 Hz/τ1/2 near 1 s (wavelengths for Yb+, Yb, Sr clock transitions are of special interest). Analysis and simulation tool of a cold atom system in trapped and freefall states relevant to atom interferometer and clock measurements in space.

"Focus Area 9 Sensors, Detectors and Instruments",S4.06Sample Collection For Life Detection in Outer Solar System Ocean World Plumes, JPL," ARC, GSFC"," TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems", 2018,"This subtopic solicits development of technologies for sample collection from plumes in the Ocean Worlds (e.g., Europa, Enceladus, Titan, Ganymede, Callisto, Ceres, etc.). This sample collection system would be used as the front-end system in conjunction with in-situ instruments developed under subtopic S1.11. This fly-through sampling subtopic is distinct from S4.02, which solicits sample collection technologies from surface platforms. These technologies must be capable of withstanding operation in space and planetary environments, including the expected pressures, radiation levels, launch and impact stresses, and range of survival and operational temperatures. Technologies that allow collection during high speed (>1 km/sec) velocity passes through a plume are of interest as are technologies that can maximize total sample mass collected while passing through tenuous plumes. Technologies that reduce mass, power, volume, and data rates without loss of scientific capability are of particular importance.

For the NASA Roadmap for Ocean World Exploration see: http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/ROW(link is external). The icy moons of the outer Solar System are of astrobiological interest. The most dramatic target for sampling from a plume is for Enceladus. Enceladus is a small icy moon of Saturn, with a radius of only 252km. Cassini data have revealed about a dozen or so jets of fine icy particles emerging from the south polar region of Enceladus. The jets have also been shown to contain organic compounds, and the south-polar region is warmed by heat flow coming from below. As a target for future missions, Enceladus rates high because fresh samples of interest are jetting into space ready for collection. Indeed, Enceladus has been added to the current call for New Frontiers missions with a focus on habitability and life detection. Particles from Enceladus also form the E-ring around Saturn. The particles in the E-ring are known to contain organics and are thus also an important target for sample collection and analysis. Recent data have indicated a possible plume at Europa that may also be carrying ocean water from that world into space. In addition to plumes, there are other energetic processes that can spray material from the surface of these low-gravity worlds into space where they could also be collected in-flight and analyzed. Collecting samples for a variety of science purposes is required. These include samples that allow for determination of the chemical and physical properties of the source ocean, samples for detailed characterization of the organics present in the gas and particle phases, and samples for analysis for biomarkers indicative of life. Thus, these Ocean Worlds of the outer Solar System offer the opportunity for a conceptually new approach to life detection focusing on in-flight sample collection of material freshly injected into space. Technologies of particular interest include sample collection systems and subsystems capable of: Capture, containment, and/or transfer of gas, liquid, ice, and/or mineral phases from plumes to sample processing and/or instrument interfaces. Technologies for characterization of collected sample parameters including mass, volume, total dissolved solids in liquid samples, and insoluble solids. Sample collection and sample capture for in-situ imaging. Systems capable of high-velocity sample collection with minimal sample alteration to allow for habitability and life detection analyses. Microfluidic sample collection systems that enable sample concentration and other manipulations. Plume material collection technologies that minimize risk of terrestrial contamination, including organic chemical and microbial contaminates.

Contrast ratios of one million to ten billion over an angular spatial scale of 0.05-1.5 arcsec are typical of these objects. Achieving a very low background requires control of both scattered and diffracted light. The failure to control either amplitude or phase fluctuations in the optical train severely reduces the effectiveness of starlight cancellation schemes.

In addition, ground based telescopes such as the Cerro Chajnantor Atacama Telescope (CCAT) requires similar technology development. The desired areal density is 1 - 10 kg/m2 with a packaging efficiency of 3-10 deployed/stowed diameter. Static and dynamic wavefront error tolerances to thermal and dynamic perturbations may be achieved through passive means (e.g., via a high stiffness system, passive thermal control, jitter isolation or damping) or through active opto-mechanical control. Large deployable multi-layer structures in support of sunshades for passive thermal control and 20m to 50m class planet finding external occulters are also relevant technologies. Potential architecture implementations must package into an existing launch volume, deploy and be self-aligning to the micron level. The target space environment is expected to be the Earth-Sun L2.

Research areas of interest include: Precision deployable structures and metrology for optical telescopes (e.g., innovative active or passive deployable primary or secondary support structures). Architectures, packaging and deployment designs for large sunshields and external occulters. In particular, important subsystem considerations may include: Innovative concepts for packaging fully integrated subsystems (e.g., power distribution, sensing, and control components). Mechanical, inflatable, or other precision deployable technologies. Thermally-stable materials (CTE < 1ppm) for deployable structures. Innovative systems, which minimize complexity, mass, power and cost. Innovative testing and verification methodologies.

The target launch volume and expected disturbances, along with the estimate of system performance, should be included in the discussion. Proposals with system solutions for large sunshields and external occulters will also be accepted. A successful proposal shows a path toward a Phase II delivery of demonstration hardware scalable to 5-meter diameter for ground test characterization. Before embarking on the design and fabrication of complex space-based deployable telescopes, additional risk reduction in operating an actively controlled telescope in orbit is desired. To be cost effective, deployable apertures that conform to a cubesat (up to 3-U) or ESPA format are desired. Consequently, deployment hinge and latching concepts, buildable for these missions and scalable to larger systems are desired.

Technical Challenges To accomplish NASAs high-priority science requires low-cost, ultra-stable, large-aperture, normal incidence mirrors with low mass-to-collecting area ratios. After performance, the most important metric for an advanced optical system is affordability or areal cost (cost per square meter of collecting aperture). Current normal incidence space mirrors cost $4 million to $6 million per square meter of optical surface area. This research effort seeks a cost reduction for precision optical components by 5 to 50 times, to between $100K/m2 to $1M/m2.

Wavefront Figure < 5 nm RMS. Wavefront Stability < 10 pm/10 min. First Mode Frequency 250 to 500 Hz. Actuator Resolution < 1 nm RMS. For Far-IR: Areal Cost for Far-IR < $100K/m2. Cryo-deformation for Far-IR < 100 nm RMS. For EUV: Slope < 0.1 micro-radian. Also needed is ability to fully characterize surface errors and predict optical performance. 1. Optical Components and Systems for potential UV/Optical Missions Large UV/Optical (LUVOIR) and Habitable Exoplanet (HabEx) Missions Potential UV/Optical missions require 4 to 16 meter monolithic or segmented primary mirrors with < 5 nm RMS surface figures. Active or passive alignment and control is required to achieve system level diffraction limited performance at wavelengths less than 500 nm (< 40 nm RMS wavefront error, WFE). Additionally, potential Exoplanet mission, using an internal coronagraph, requires total telescope wavefront stability on order of 10 pico-meters RMS per 10 minutes. This stability specification places severe constraints on the dynamic mechanical and thermal performance of 4 meter and larger telescope. To meet this requirement requires active thermal control systems, ultra-stable mirror support structures, and vibration compensation. Mirror areal density depends upon available launch vehicle capacities to Sun-Earth L2 (i.e., 15 kg/m2 for a 5 m fairing EELV vs. 150 kg/m2 for a 10 m fairing SLS). Regarding areal cost, a good goal is to keep the total cost of the primary mirror at or below $100M. Thus, an 8-m class mirror (with 50 m2 of collecting area) should have an areal cost of less than $2M/m2. And, a 16-m class mirror (with 200 m2 of collecting area) should have an areal cost of less than $0.5M/m2. Key technologies to enable such a mirror include new and improved: Mirror substrate materials and/or architectural designs. Processes to rapidly fabricate and test UVO quality mirrors. Mirror support structures that are ultra-stable at the desired scale. Mirror support structures with low-mass that can survive launch at the desired scale. Mechanisms and sensors to align segmented mirrors to < 1 nm RMS precisions. Thermal control (< 1 mK) to reduce wavefront stability to < 10 pm RMS per 10 min. Dynamic isolation (> 140 dB) to reduce wavefront stability to < 10 pm RMS per 10 min. Also needed is ability to fully characterize surface errors and predict optical performance via integrated opto-mechanical modeling. Potential solutions for substrate material/architecture include, but are not limited to: ultra-uniform low CTE glasses, silicon carbide, nanolaminates or carbon-fiber reinforced polymer. Potential solutions for mirror support structure material/architecture include, but are not limited to: additive manufacturing, nature inspired architectures, nano-particle composites, carbon fiber, graphite composite, ceramic or SiC materials, etc. Potential solutions for new fabrication processes include, but are not limited to: additive manufacture, direct precision machining, rapid optical fabrication, roller embossing at optical tolerances, slumping or replication technologies to manufacture 1 to 2-meter (or larger) precision quality components. Potential solutions for achieving the 10 pico-meter wavefront stability include, but are not limited to: metrology, passive, and active control for optical alignment and mirror phasing; active vibration isolation; metrology, passive, and active thermal control; Ultra-Stable Balloon Telescopes and Telescope Structures Multiple potential balloon and space missions to perform Astrophysics, Exoplanet and Planetary science investigations require a complete optical telescope system with 0.5 meter or larger of collecting aperture. 1-m class balloon-borne telescopes have flown successfully, however, the cost for design and construction of such telescopes can exceed $6M, and the weight of these telescopes limits the scientific payload and duration of the balloon mission. A 4X reduction in cost and mass would enable missions which today are not feasible. Space-based gravitational wave observatories (eLISA) need a 0.5-meter class ultra-stable telescope with an optical path length stability of a picometer over periods of roughly one hour at temperatures near 230K in the presence of large applied thermal gradients. The telescope will be operated in simultaneous transmit and receive mode, so an unobstructed design is required to achieve extremely low backscatter light performance. Balloon Planetary Telescope Astronomy from a stratospheric balloon platform offers numerous advantages for planetary science. At typical balloon cruise altitudes (100,000 to 130,000 ft.), 99%+ of the atmospheric is below the balloon and the attenuation due to the remaining atmosphere is small, especially in the near ultraviolet band and in the infrared bands near 2.7 and 4.25 µm. The lack of atmosphere nearly eliminates scintillation and allows the resolution potential of relatively large optics to be realized, and the small amount of atmosphere reduces scattered light and allows observations of brighter objects even during daylight hours. For additional discussion of the advantages of observations from stratosphere platforms, refer to “Planetary Balloon-Based Science Platform Evaluation and Program Implementation - Final Report,” Dankanich et. al. (NASA/TM-2016-218870, available from https://ntrs.nasa.gov/). To perform Planetary Science requires a 1-meter class telescope 500 nm diffraction limited performance or Primary Mirror System that can maintain < 10 nm rms surface figure error for elevation angles ranging from 0 to 60 degrees over a temperature range from 220K to 280K. Phase I will produce a preliminary design and report including initial design requirements such as wave-front error budget, mass allocation budget, structural stiffness requirements, etc. trade studies performed and analysis that compares the design to the expected performance over the specified operating range. Development challenges shall be identified during Phase I including trade studies and challenges to be addressed during Phase II with subsystem proof of concept demonstration hardware. If Phase II can only produce a sub-scale component, then it should also produce a detailed final design, including final requirements (wave-front error budget, mass allocation, etc.) and performance assessment over the specified operating range.

Aberrations, especially spherical aberration, and surface roughness in the optical telescope can kill the signal. Additionally, the telescope beam expander must maintain the laser beam’s circular polarization. The incumbent telescope technology is a Dahl-Kirkham beam expander.

Focus Area 10 Advanced Telescope Technologies,"S2.04X-Ray Mirror Systems Technology, Coating Technology for X-Ray-UV-OIR, and Free-Form Optics", GSFC," JPL, MSFC"," TA8 Science Instruments, Observatories & Sensor Systems", 2018,"This subtopic focuses on three areas of technology development: X-Ray manufacturing, coating, testing, and assembling complete mirror systems in addition to maturing the current technology. Coating technology including Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) for wide range of wavelengths from X-Ray to IR: X-Ray, EUV (extreme ultraviolet), LUV (Lyman ultraviolet), VUV (vacuum ultraviolet), Visible, and IR (infrared) telescopes. Free-form Optics design, fabrication, and metrology for CubeSat, SmallSat and various coronagraphic instruments. A typical Phase I proposal for X-Ray technology would address the relevant optical sub-component of a system with necessary coating and stray light suppression for X-Ray missions or prototype demonstration of a fabricated system and its testing. Similarly, a Coating technology proposal would address fabrication and testing of optical surfaces for a wide range of wavelengths from X-Ray, EUV, LUV, VUV, Visible and IR. The Free-form Optics proposals tackle the challenges involved in design, fabrication, and metrology of non-spherical surfaces for small-size missions such as CubeSat, NanoSat, and coronagraphic instruments. In a nutshell, a successful proposal demonstrates a low-cost ability to address NASA science mission needs and technical challenges specified under each category with feasible plan to develop the technology for infusion into NASA Decadal class missions and sub-orbital rockets and/or balloon for IR-class telescopes. The National Academy Astro2010 Decadal Report identifies studies of optical components and ability to manufacture, coat, and perform metrology needed to enable future X-Ray observatory missions such as Next Generation of X-Ray Observatories (NGXO). The Astrophysics Decadal specifically calls for optical coating technology investment for future UV, Optical, Exoplanet, and IR missions while Heliophysics 2009 Roadmap identifies the coating technology for space missions to enhance rejection of undesirable spectral lines, improve space/solar-flux durability of EUV optical coatings, and coating deposition to increase the maximum spatial resolution. Future optical systems for NASAs low-cost missions, CubeSat and other small-scale payloads, are moving away from traditional spherical optics to non-spherical surfaces with anticipated benefits of freeform optics such as fast wide-field and distortion-free cameras. X-Ray Optical Component, Systems, and Technologies NASA large X-Ray observatory requires low-cost, ultra-stable, light-weight mirrors with high-reflectance optical coatings and effective stray light suppression. The current state-of-art of mirror fabrication technology for X-Ray missions is very expensive and time consuming. Additionally, a number of improvements such as 10 arc-second angular resolutions and 1 to 5 m2 collecting area are needed for this technology. Likewise, the stray-light suppression system is bulky and ineffective for wide-field of view telescopes. In this area, we are looking to address the multiple technologies including: improvements to manufacturing (machining, rapid optical fabrication, slumping or replication technologies), improved metrology, performance prediction and testing techniques, active control of mirror shapes, new structures for holding and actively aligning of mirrors in a telescope assembly to enable X-Ray observatories while lowering the cost per square meter of collecting aperture and effective design of stray-light suppression in preparation for the Decadal Survey of 2020. Currently, X-Ray space mirrors cost $4 million to $6 million per square meter of optical surface area. This research effort seeks a cost reduction for precision optical components by 5 to 50 times, to less than $1M to $100 K/m2. Coating Technologies for X-Ray, EUV, LUV, UV, Visible, and IR Telescopes The optical coating technology is a mission-enabling feature that enhances the optical performance and science return of a mission. Lowering the areal cost of coating determines if a proposed mission could be funded in the current cost environment. The most common forms of coating used on precision optics are anti-reflective (AR) coating and high reflective coating. The current coating technology of optical components needs to achieve TRL-6 by approximately 2018 to support the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal process. A number of optical coating metrics specific to each wavelength are desired such as: The Optical Coating Metrics The telescope optical coating needs to meet low temperature operation requirement. Its desirable to achieve 35 K in future. X-Ray Metrics: Multilayer high-reflectance coatings for hard X-Ray mirrors similar to NuSTAR. Multilayer depth gradient coatings for 5 to 80 KeV with high broadband reflectivity. Zero-net-stress coating for iridium or other high-reflectance elements on thin substrates (< 0.5 mm). EUV Metrics: Reflectivity > 90% from 6 nm to 90 nm and the ability to be applied onto a < 2-meter mirror substrate. LUVOIR Metrics: Broadband reflectivity > 70% from 90 nm to 120 nm (LUV); > 90% from 120 nm to 2500 nm (VUV/Visible/IR); Reflectivity non-uniformity < 1% from 90 nm to 2500 nm. Induced polarization aberration < 1% from 400 nm to 2500 nm and depositable onto 1 to 8 m substrates. Non-Stationary Metric: Non- uniform optical coating to be used in both reflection and transmission that vary with location and optical surface. Variation pertains to ratio of reflectivity to transmissivity, optical field amplitude, phase, and polarization change. The optical surface area ranges from 1/2 to 6 cm. Scattered Light Suppression Using Carbon Nanotube (CNT) Coating A number of future NASA missions require suppression of scattered light. For instance, the precision optical cube utilized in a beam-splitter application forms a knife-edge that is positioned within the optical system to split a single beam into two halves. The scattered light from the knife-edge could be suppressed by CNT coating. Similarly, the scattered light for gravitational-wave application and lasercom system where the simultaneous transmit/receive operation is required, could be achieved by highly absorbing coating such as CNT. Ideally, the application of CNT coating needs to achieve: Broadband (visible plus Near IR), reflectivity of 0.1% or less. Resist bleaching of significant albedo changes over a mission life of at least 10 years. Withstand launch conditions such vibe, acoustics, etc. Tolerate both high continuous wave (CW) and pulsed power and power densities without damage. ~10 W for CE and ~ 0.1 GW/cm2 density, and 1 kW/nanosecond pulses. Adhere to the multi-layer dielectric or protected metal coating including Ion Beam Sputtering (IBS) coating. Freeform Optics Design, Fabrication, and Metrology Future NASA missions with alternative low-cost science and small-size payload are constrained by the traditional spherical form of optics. These missions could benefit greatly by the freeform optics as they provide non-spherical optics with better aerodynamic characteristics for spacecraft with lightweight components to meet the mission requirements. Currently, the design and utilization of conformal and freeform shapes are costly due to fabrication and metrology of these parts. Even though various techniques are being investigated to create complex optical surfaces, small-size missions highly desire efficient small packages with lower cost that increase the field of view and expand operational temperature range of unobscured systems. For the coronagraphic applications, freeform optical components allow coronagraphic nulling without shearing and increase the useful science field of view. In this category, freeform optical prescription for surfaces of 0.5 cm to 6 cm diameters with tolerances of 1 to 2 nm rms are needed. In this respect, the freeform refers to either 2nd order conic prescription with higher order surface polished onto it or without underlying conic prescription with no steps in the surface. The optics with underlying conic prescription would need to be in F/# range of F/2 to F/20. In addition to the freeform fabrication, the metrology of freeform optical components is difficult and challenging due to the large departure from planar or spherical shapes accommodated by conventional interferometric testing. New methods such as multibeam low-coherence optical probe and slope sensitive optical probe are highly desirable.

Long duration balloon flights currently utilize satellite communication systems to relay science and operations data from the balloon to ground based control centers. The current maximum downlink bit rate is 150 kilobits per second operating continuously during the balloon flight. Future requirements are for bit rates of 1 megabit per second or more. Improvements in bit rate performance, reduction in size and mass of existing systems, or reductions in cost of high bit rate systems are needed. TDRSS and Iridium satellite communications are currently used for balloon payload applications. A commercial S-band TDRSS transceiver and mechanically steered 18 dBi gain antenna provide 150 kbps continuous downlink. TDRSS K-band transceivers are available but are currently cost prohibitive. Open Port Iridium service is also currently being used. Balloon Sensors and Instrumentation Improved and innovative devices to make measurements of the balloon and the ambient flight environment are needed. Devices or methods to accurately and continuously measure ambient air, helium gas, balloon film temperatures, ambient wind velocity and film strain are desired. These measurements are needed to accurately model the balloon performance during a typical flight at altitudes of approximately 120,000 feet. The measurements must compensate for the effects of direct solar radiation through shielding or calculation. Minimal mass and volume are highly desired. For film measurements, a non-invasive and non-contact approach is highly desired for the thin polyethylene film, with film thickness ranging from 0.8 to 1.5 mil, used as the balloon envelope. Devices for these measurements must be compatible with existing NASA systems and operations.

Improvements in bit rate performance, reduction in size and mass of existing systems, or reductions in cost of high bit rate systems are needed. TDRSS and Iridium satellite communications are currently used for balloon payload applications.

","Improved and innovative devices to make measurements of the balloon and the ambient flight environment are needed. Devices or methods to accurately and continuously measure ambient air, helium gas, balloon film temperatures, ambient wind velocity and film strain are desired. These measurements are needed to accurately model the balloon performance during a typical flight at altitudes of approximately 120,000 feet. The measurements must compensate for the effects of direct solar radiation through shielding or calculation. Minimal mass and volume are highly desired.

Focus Area 11 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,S4.05Contamination Control and Planetary Protection, JPL, GSFC," TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems", 2018,"A need to develop technologies to implement Contamination Control and Planetary Protection requirements has emerged in recent years with increased interest in investigating bodies with the potential for life detection such as Europa, Enceladus, Mars, etc. and the potential for sample return from such bodies. Planetary Protection is concerned with both forward and backward contamination. Forward contamination is the transfer of viable organisms from Earth to another body. Backward contamination is the transfer of material posing a biological threat back to Earth's biosphere. NASA is seeking innovative technologies or applications of technologies to facilitate meeting portions of forward and backward contamination Planetary Protection requirements as well as analytical technologies that can ensure hardware and instrumentation can meet organic contamination requirements in an effort to preserve sample science integrity. For contamination control efforts, analytical technologies and techniques for quantifying submicron particle and organic contamination for validating surface cleaning methods are needed. In particular, capabilities for measuring Total Organic Carbon (TOC) at <<40 ppb or <<20 ng/cm2 on a surface and detection of particles <0.2 microns in size are being sought. In addition, techniques for detection of one or more of the following molecules and detection level are needed: DNA (1 fmole). Dipicolinic acid (1 pg). N-acetylglucosamine (1 pg). Glycine and alanine (1 pg). Palmitic acid (1 pg). Sqalene (1 pg). Pristane (1pg). Chlorobenzene (<1 pg). Dichloromethane (<1 pg). Naphthalene (1 pg). For many missions, Planetary Protection requirements are often implemented in part by processing hardware or potentially entire spacecraft with one or more sterilization processes. These processes are often incompatible with particular materials or components on the spacecraft and extensive effort is made to try to mitigate these issues. Innovative new or improved sterilization/re-sterilization processes are being sought for application to spacecraft hardware to increase effectiveness of reducing bio-load on spacecraft or increase process compatibility with hardware (e.g., toxicity to hardware, temperature, duration, etc.). Accepted processes currently include heat processing, gamma/electron beam irradiation, cold plasma, and vapor hydrogen peroxide. Options to improve materials and parts (e.g., sensors, seals, in particular, batteries, valves, and optical coatings) to be compatible with currently accepted processes, in particular heat tolerance, are needed. NASA is seeking novel technologies for preventing recontamination of sterilized components or spacecraft as a whole (e.g., biobarriers). In addition, active in-situ recontamination/decontamination approaches (e.g., in-situ heating of sample containers to drive off volatiles prior to sample collection) and in-situ sterilization approaches (e.g., UV or plasma) for surfaces are desired. Missions planning sample return from bodies such as Mars, Europa, and Enceladus are faced with developing technologies for sample return functions to assure containment of material from these bodies. Thus far, concepts have been developed specifically for Mars sample return but no end-to-end concepts have been developed that do not have technical challenges remaining in one or more areas. Options for sample canisters with seal(s) (e.g., brazing, explosive welding, soft) with sealing performed either on surface or in orbit and capability to verify seal(s), potentially by leak detection are needed. In addition, capability is needed for opening seals while maintaining sample integrity upon Earth return. These technologies need to be compatible with processes the materials may encounter over the lifecycle of the mission (e.g., high temperature heating). Containment assurance also requires technologies to break-the-chain of contact with the sampled body. Any native contamination on the returned sample container and/or Earth return vehicle must be either be fully contained, sterilized, or removed prior to return to Earth, therefore, technologies or concepts to mitigate this contamination are desired. Lightweight shielding technologies are also needed for meteoroid protection for the Earth entry vehicle and sample canister with capability to detect damage or breach to meet a 10-6 probability of loss of containment.

"Focus Area 12 Entry, Descent and Landing Systems","Z7.01Entry Descent & Landing Sensors for Environment Characterization, Vehicle Performance, and Guidance, Navigation and Control", ARC," JPL, JSC, LaRC"," TA9 Entry, Descent and Landing Systems", 2018,"NASA manned and robotic missions to the surface of planetary or airless bodies require Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL). For many of these missions, EDL represents one of the riskiest phases of the mission. Despite the criticality of the EDL phase, NASA has historically gathered limited engineering data from such missions, and use of the data for real-time Guidance, Navigation and Control (GN&C) during EDL for precise landing (aside from Earth) has also been limited. Recent notable exceptions are the Orion EFT-1 flight test, MSL MEDLI sensor suite, and the planned sensor capabilities for Mars 2020 (MEDLI2 and map-relative navigation). NASA requires EDL sensors to: Understand the in-situ entry environment. Characterize the performance of entry vehicles. Make autonomous and real-time onboard GN&C decisions to ensure a precise landing. This subtopic describes three related technology areas where innovative sensor technologies would enable or enhance future NASA EDL missions. Candidate solutions are sought that can be made compatible with the environmental conditions of deep spaceflight, the rigors of landing on planetary bodies both with and without atmospheres. Proposers may submit to topic areas 1, 2 or 3 below: High accuracy, light weight, low power fiber optic sensing system for EDL instrumentation systems. Miniaturized spectrometers for vacuum ultraviolet & mid-wave infrared radiation in-situ measurements during atmospheric entry. Novel sensing technologies for EDL GN&C and small body proximity operations. High Accuracy, Light Weight, Low Power Fiber Optic Sensing System for EDL Instrumentation Systems Current NASA state-of-the-art EDL sensing systems are very expensive to design and incorporate on planetary missions. Commercial fiber optic systems offer an alternative that could result in a lower overall cost and weight, while actually increasing the number of measurements. Fiber optic systems are also immune to Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI) which reduces design and qualification efforts. This would be highly beneficial to future planetary missions requiring thermal protection system (TPS). Fiber optic sensing systems can offer benefits over traditional sensing system like MEDLI and MEDLI2, and can be used for both rigid and flexible TPS. To be considered against NASA state-of-the-art TPS sensing systems for future flight missions, fiber optic systems must be competitive in sensing capability (measurement type, accuracy, quantity), and sensor support electronics (SSE) mass, size and power. The upcoming Mars 2020 mission will fly the Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing Instrumentation II (MEDLI2) sensor suite consisting of a total of 24 thermocouples, 8 pressure transducers, 2 heat flux sensors, and a radiometer embedded in the TPS. This set of instrumentation will directly inform the large performance uncertainties that contribute to the design and validation of a Mars entry system. A better understanding of the entry environment and TPS performance could lead to reduced design margins enabling a greater payload mass fraction and smaller landing ellipses. Fiber optic sensing systems can offer benefits over traditional sensing system like MEDLI and MEDLI2, and can be used for both rigid and flexible TPS. Fiber optic sensing benefits include, but are not limited to; sensor immunity to EMI, the ability to have thousands of measurements per fiber using Fiber Bragg grating (FBG), multiple types of measurements per fiber (i.e., temperature, strain, and pressure), and resistance to metallic corrosion. To be considered against NASA state-of-the-art TPS sensing systems for future flight missions, fiber optic systems must be competitive in sensing capability (measurement type, accuracy, quantity), and sensor support electronics (SSE) mass, size and power. Therefore, NASA is looking for a fiber optic system that can meet the following requirements: Sensing Requirements: TPS Temperature: Measurement Range: -200 to 1250° C (up to 2000° C preferred), Accuracy: +/- 5° C desired. Surface Pressure: Measurement Range: 0-15 psi, Accuracy: +/-1% Sensor Support Electronics Requirements (including enclosure): Weight: 12 lbs or less, Size: 240 cubic inches or smaller, Power: 15W or less, Measurement Resolution: 14-bit or Higher, Acquisition Rate per Measurement: 16 Hz or Higher, Compatibility with other sensors types (e.g.) Heat Flux, Strain, Radiometer, TPS recession. Miniaturized Spectrometers for Vacuum Ultraviolet & Mid-Wave Infrared Radiation In-Situ Measurements During Atmospheric Entry The current state-of-the-art for flight radiation measurements includes radiometers and spectrometers. Radiometers can measure heating integrated over a wide wavelength range (e.g., MEDLI2 Radiometer), or over a narrow-wavelength bands (COMARS+ ICOTOM at 2900 nm and 4500 nm). Spectrometers gather spectrally resolved signal and have been developed for Orion EM-2 (combined Ocean Optics STS units with range of 190-1100 nm). A spectrometer provides the gold standard for improving predictive models and improving future entry vehicle designs. For NASA missions through CO2 atmospheres (Venus and Mars), a majority of the radiative heating occurs in the midwave infrared range (MWIR: 1500 nm - 6000 nm) [Brandis, AIAA 2015-3111]. Similarly, for entries to Earth, the radiation is dominated by the Vacuum Ultraviolet range (VUV: 100 - 190 nm) [Cruden, AIAA 2009-4240]. Both of these ranges are outside of those detectable by available miniaturized spectrometers. While laboratory scale spectrometers and detectors are available to measure these spectral ranges, there are no versions of these spectrometers which would be suitable for integration into a flight vehicle due to lack of miniaturization. This SBIR calls for miniaturization of VUV and MWIR spectrometers to extend the current state of the art for flight diagnostics. Advancements in either VUV or MWIR measurements are sought, preferably for sensors with: Self-contained with a maximum dimension of ~10 cm or less. No active liquid cooling. Simple interfaces compatible with spacecraft electronics, such as RS232, RS422, or Spacewire. Survival to military spec temperature ranges [-55 to 125C]. Power usage of order 5W or less. Novel Sensing Technologies for EDL GN&C and Small Body Proximity Operations NASA seeks innovative sensor technologies to enhance success for EDL operations on missions to other planetary bodies (including Earth's Moon, Mars, Venus, Titan, and Europa). Sensor technologies are also desired to enhance proximity operations (including sampling and landing) on small bodies such as asteroids and comets. NASA is also looking for high-fidelity real-time simulation and stimulation of passive and active optical sensors for computer vision at update rates greater than 2 Hz to be used for signal injection in terrestrial spacecraft system test beds. These solutions are to be focused on improving system-level performance Verification and Validation during spacecraft assembly and test. Sensing technologies are desired that determine any number of the following: Terrain relative translational state (altimetry/3-axis velocimetry). Spacecraft absolute state in planetary/small-body frame (either attitude, translation, or both). Terrain characterization (e.g., 3D point cloud) for hazard detection, absolute and/or relative state estimation, landing/sampling site selection, and/or body shape characterization. Wind-relative vehicle state and environment during atmospheric entry (e.g., velocity, density, surface pressure, temperature). Successful candidate sensor technologies can address this call by: Extending the dynamic range over which such measurements are collected (e.g., providing a single surface topology sensor that works over a large altitude range such as 1m to >10km, and high attitude rates such as greater than 45° /sec). Improving the state-of-the-art in measurement accuracy/precision/resolution for the above sensor needs. Substantially reducing the amount of external processing needed by the host vehicle to calculate the measurements. Significantly reducing the impact of incorporating such sensors on the spacecraft in terms of Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP), spacecraft accommodation complexity, and/or cost. Providing sensors that are robust to environmental dust/sand/illumination effects. Mitigation technologies for dust/particle contamination of optical surfaces such as sensor optics, with possible extensibility to solar panels and thermal surfaces for Lunar, asteroid, and comet missions. Sensing for wind-relative vehicle velocity, local atmospheric density, and vehicle aerodynamics (e.g., surface pressures and temperatures).

This set of instrumentation will directly inform the large performance uncertainties that contribute to the design and validation of a Mars entry system. A better understanding of the entry environment and TPS performance could lead to reduced design margins enabling a greater payload mass fraction and smaller landing ellipses. Fiber optic sensing systems can offer benefits over traditional sensing system like MEDLI and MEDLI2, and can be used for both rigid and flexible TPS. Fiber optic sensing benefits include, but are not limited to; sensor immunity to EMI, the ability to have thousands of measurements per fiber using Fiber Bragg grating (FBG), multiple types of measurements per fiber (i.e., temperature, strain, and pressure), and resistance to metallic corrosion.
To be considered against NASA state-of-the-art TPS sensing systems for future flight missions, fiber optic systems must be competitive in sensing capability (measurement type, accuracy, quantity), and sensor support electronics (SSE) mass, size and power. Therefore, NASA is looking for a fiber optic system that can meet the following requirements:
Sensing Requirements:
TPS Temperature: Measurement Range: -200 to 1250° C (up to 2000° C preferred), Accuracy: +/- 5° C desired. Surface Pressure: Measurement Range: 0-15 psi, Accuracy: +/-1%
Sensor Support Electronics Requirements (including enclosure):
Weight: 12 lbs or less, Size: 240 cubic inches or smaller, Power: 15W or less, Measurement Resolution: 14-bit or Higher, Acquisition Rate per Measurement: 16 Hz or Higher, Compatibility with other sensors types (e.g.) Heat Flux, Strain, Radiometer, TPS recession.
","The current state-of-the-art for flight radiation measurements includes radiometers and spectrometers. Radiometers can measure heating integrated over a wide wavelength range (e.g., MEDLI2 Radiometer), or over a narrow-wavelength bands (COMARS+ ICOTOM at 2900 nm and 4500 nm). Spectrometers gather spectrally resolved signal and have been developed for Orion EM-2 (combined Ocean Optics STS units with range of 190-1100 nm). A spectrometer provides the gold standard for improving predictive models and improving future entry vehicle designs.
For NASA missions through CO2 atmospheres (Venus and Mars), a majority of the radiative heating occurs in the midwave infrared range (MWIR: 1500 nm - 6000 nm) [Brandis, AIAA 2015-3111]. Similarly, for entries to Earth, the radiation is dominated by the Vacuum Ultraviolet range (VUV: 100 - 190 nm) [Cruden, AIAA 2009-4240]. Both of these ranges are outside of those detectable by available miniaturized spectrometers. While laboratory scale spectrometers and detectors are available to measure these spectral ranges, there are no versions of these spectrometers which would be suitable for integration into a flight vehicle due to lack of miniaturization. This SBIR calls for miniaturization of VUV and MWIR spectrometers to extend the current state of the art for flight diagnostics.
Advancements in either VUV or MWIR measurements are sought, preferably for sensors with:
Self-contained with a maximum dimension of ~10 cm or less. No active liquid cooling. Simple interfaces compatible with spacecraft electronics, such as RS232, RS422, or Spacewire. Survival to military spec temperature ranges [-55 to 125C]. Power usage of order 5W or less.
","NASA seeks innovative sensor technologies to enhance success for EDL operations on missions to other planetary bodies (including Earth's Moon, Mars, Venus, Titan, and Europa). Sensor technologies are also desired to enhance proximity operations (including sampling and landing) on small bodies such as asteroids and comets. NASA is also looking for high-fidelity real-time simulation and stimulation of passive and active optical sensors for computer vision at update rates greater than 2 Hz to be used for signal injection in terrestrial spacecraft system test beds. These solutions are to be focused on improving system-level performance Verification and Validation during spacecraft assembly and test.
Sensing technologies are desired that determine any number of the following:
Terrain relative translational state (altimetry/3-axis velocimetry). Spacecraft absolute state in planetary/small-body frame (either attitude, translation, or both). Terrain characterization (e.g., 3D point cloud) for hazard detection, absolute and/or relative state estimation, landing/sampling site selection, and/or body shape characterization. Wind-relative vehicle state and environment during atmospheric entry (e.g., velocity, density, surface pressure, temperature).
Successful candidate sensor technologies can address this call by:
Extending the dynamic range over which such measurements are collected (e.g., providing a single surface topology sensor that works over a large altitude range such as 1m to >10km, and high attitude rates such as greater than 45° /sec). Improving the state-of-the-art in measurement accuracy/precision/resolution for the above sensor needs. Substantially reducing the amount of external processing needed by the host vehicle to calculate the measurements. Significantly reducing the impact of incorporating such sensors on the spacecraft in terms of Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP), spacecraft accommodation complexity, and/or cost. Providing sensors that are robust to environmental dust/sand/illumination effects. Mitigation technologies for dust/particle contamination of optical surfaces such as sensor optics, with possible extensibility to solar panels and thermal surfaces for Lunar, asteroid, and comet missions. Sensing for wind-relative vehicle velocity, local atmospheric density, and vehicle aerodynamics (e.g., surface pressures and temperatures).

"Focus Area 12 Entry, Descent and Landing Systems",Z7.03Deployable Aerodynamic Decelerator Technology, LaRC," ARC, GRC, JSC, MSFC"," TA9 Entry, Descent and Landing Systems", 2018,"Background: NASA is developing deployable aerodynamic decelerators to enhance, and enable, robotic and human missions to destinations such as Mars, Venus, and Titan, as well as returning payloads to Earth from Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The biggest challenge facing Entry, Descent and Landing systems is the delivery of human class missions to the surface of Mars. One benefit of deployable decelerators is that a relatively large atmospheric entry vehicle can be packed into, and deployed from, a comparatively small space transit vehicle. Eliminating these entry vehicle size constraints imposed by the launch system enables delivery of very large (20 metric tons or more) of usable payload required to support Mars human exploration. For reference, it is estimated that safely landing 20 metric tons may need a deployable diameter as large as 20 meters. The technology also allows for the return of payloads from LEO and recovery of launch assets that will reduce the cost of space access. This subtopic area solicits innovative technology solutions applicable to deployable entry vehicles. Specific technology development areas include: Advancements in woven and non-woven textile technologies that can be used in the design and production of mass efficient flexible thermal protection systems (TPS) such as durable, high-temperature fibrous insulators capable of efficiently suppressing both radiation and convective heat transfer at temperatures above 1200° C. TPS concepts must be flexible to allow compact stowage. They can be passive approaches that do not rely on decomposition to manage heat loads, or active systems, such as phase change approaches, that enhance thermal management capability. Reusable concepts and/or materials, capable of surviving multiple atmospheric entries, are of particular interest. Focus of Phase I development can be subscale manufacturing demonstrations that lead to Phase II manufacturing scale up that is relevant to Mars human exploration. Concepts that augment the drag of rigid or deployable hypersonic aerodynamic decelerators subsequent to the hypersonic entry phase. Envisioned secondary decelerator systems would be activated after the entry heat pulse during the earliest stages of the supersonic regime. Devices can be either deployable or rigid design concepts, but must be suitable for, and scalable to, a Mars human exploration architecture. Inflatable structural designs and deployment methods for a secondary decelerator that augment drag over the primary decelerator by a factor or 2 to 4 are to be considered. Phase I proof of concept and preliminary design requirements that will lead to a demonstration under a Phase II effort are of interest. Inflatable structural concepts with non-axisymmetric geometries, or features, that provide lift for flight control during atmospheric entry. Envisioned concepts can be deployed or adjusted to provide active flight control to improve landing accuracy. Concepts that provide lift-to-drag ratios of 0.1 to 0.2 during hypersonic flight conditions appear to be sufficient for human exploration of Mars. Lift-to-drag ratios of 0.8 or more may provide benefit, or may be enabling, for other destinations with atmospheres. Innovations can include morphing concepts, drag modulators, or center of gravity offset approaches. Thermal management and response time should be addressed. Phase I proof of concept and preliminary design requirements that will lead to a demonstration under a Phase II effort are of interest.

Focus Area 13 Information Technologies for Science Data,S5.01Technologies for Large-Scale Numerical Simulation, ARC, GSFC," TA11 Modeling, Simulation, Information Technology and Processing", 2018,"NASA scientists and engineers are increasingly turning to large-scale numerical simulation on supercomputers to advance understanding of complex Earth and astrophysical systems, and to conduct high-fidelity aerospace engineering analyses. The goal of this subtopic is to increase the mission impact of NASA's investments in supercomputing systems and associated operations and services. Specific objectives are to: Decrease the barriers to entry for prospective supercomputing users. Minimize the supercomputer user's total time-to-solution (e.g., time to discover, understand, predict, or design). Increase the achievable scale and complexity of computational analysis, data ingest, and data communications. Reduce the cost of providing a given level of supercomputing performance for NASA applications. Enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of NASA's supercomputing operations and services. Expected outcomes are to improve the productivity of NASA's supercomputing users, broaden NASA's supercomputing user base, accelerate advancement of NASA science and engineering, and benefit the supercomputing community through dissemination of operational best practices. The approach of this subtopic is to seek novel software and hardware technologies that provide notable benefits to NASA's supercomputing users and facilities, and to infuse these technologies into NASA supercomputing operations. Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, NASA's high-end computing (HEC) projects - the High-End Computing Capability project at Ames and the Scientific Computing project at Goddard. To assure maximum relevance to NASA, funded SBIR contracts under this subtopic should engage in direct interactions with one or both HEC projects, and with key HEC users where appropriate. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and NASA relevance during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration. Offerors should demonstrate awareness of the state-of-the-art of their proposed technology, and should leverage existing commercial capabilities and research efforts where appropriate. Open source software and open standards are strongly preferred. Note that the NASA supercomputing environment is characterized by: HEC systems operating behind a firewall to meet strict IT security requirements. Communication-intensive applications. Massive computations requiring high concurrency. Complex computational workflows and immense datasets. The need to support hundreds of complex application codes - many of which are frequently updated by the user/developer. Projects need not benefit all NASA HEC users or application codes, but demonstrating applicability to an important NASA discipline, or even a key NASA application code, could provide significant value. For instance, a GPU accelerated (or multi-core) planetary accretion code such as LIPAD (Lagrangian Integrator for Planetary Accretion and Dynamics) could be one possible project. The three main technology areas of S5.01 are aligned with three objectives of NSCI, the National Strategic Computing Initiative, announced by the White House in July 2015. The overarching goal of NSCI is to coordinate and accelerate U.S. activities in HEC, including hardware, software, and workforce development, so that the U.S. remains the world leader in HEC technology and application. NSCI charges every agency that is a significant user of HEC to make a significant contribution to this goal. This SBIR subtopic is an important part of NASA's contribution to NSCI. See https://www.nitrd.gov/nsci/index.aspx(link is external) for more information about NSCI. The three main elements of S5.01 are: Many NASA science applications demand much faster supercomputers. This area seeks technologies to accelerate the development of an efficient and practical exascale computing system (1018 operations per second). Innovative file systems that leverage node memory and a new exascale operating system geared toward NASA applications are two possible technologies for this element. At the same time, this area calls for technology to support co-design (i.e., concurrent design) of NASA applications and exascale supercomputers, enabling application scaling to billion-fold parallelism while dramatically increasing memory access efficiency. This supports NSCI Objective 1 (Accelerating delivery of a capable exascale computing system that integrates hardware and software capability to deliver approximately 100 times the performance of current 10 petaflop systems across a range of applications representing government needs.). Data analytics is becoming a bigger part of the supercomputing workload, as computed and measured data expand dramatically, and the need grows to rapidly utilize and understand that data. This area calls for technologies that support convergence of computing systems optimized for modeling & simulation and those optimized for data analytics (e.g., data assimilation, data compression, image analysis, machine learning, visualization, and data mining). In-situ data analytics that can run in-memory side-by-side with the model run is another possible technology for this element. This supports NSCI Objective 2 (Increasing coherence between the technology base used for modeling and simulation and that used for data analytic computing.). Presently it is difficult to integrate cyberinfrastructure elements (supercomputing system, data stores, distributed teams, instruments, mobile devices, etc.) into an efficient and productive science environment. This area seeks technologies to make elements of the supercomputing ecosystem much more accessible and composable, while maintaining security. This supports NSCI Objective 4 (Increasing the capacity and capability of an enduring national HPC ecosystem by employing a holistic approach that addresses relevant factors such as networking technology, workflow, downward scaling, foundational algorithms & software, accessibility, and workforce development.).

The main focus of this subtopic is improving the pipeline from NASA Earth Science data and products to a range of end user communities to support decision making. To that end, one area of interest is new or improved decision support tools for a variety of applications areas (http://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/ar2014/index.html#/applications-areas), including but not limited to, disaster response, agricultural and food security, water resource management, ecological forecasting, land surface modeling, air quality and health. Under this subtopic, NASA also invites proposals from companies that provide innovative data science tools to extract new insights from applicable NASA Earth science dataset that can support emerging commercial activities. State-of-the-art geospatial data analytics such as automated image classification, feature extraction, or change detection deployed at scale can reveal new insights and drive increased utilization of publicly available NASA Earth science data. NASA Earth science data may be fused with non-NASA remote sensing data or even non-remote sensing data to provide context or other added value and unlock new information products. Areas of commercial focus (not all inclusive) include agricultural, financial services, transportation, logistics, oil, gas, resource extraction, land management, water resource management, and leisure industries. This subtopic aims to connect and demonstrate the integration of NASA Earth science data and models into societal benefit areas and commercial applications. This solicitation encourages project teams to consider products from recently-launched NASA Missions, as well as simulated products from upcoming, planned missions (e.g., SMAP, GPM, Landsat, GRACE, GRACE-FO, IceSat-2, SWOT), and field campaigns or other observatories (e.g., Airborne Snow Observatory (http://aso.jpl.nasa.gov/), SnowEx (https://snow.nasa.gov/snowex)). Projects may consider connecting with NASA-sponsored activities including, but not limited to SPoRT (http://weather.msfc.nasa.gov/sport/) and NASA Earth Exchange- NEX (https://nex.nasa.gov/nex/). The NASA Applied Science Program sponsors several Capacity Building Programs, including SERVIR (http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/servir/), DEVELOP (https://develop.larc.nasa.gov/) and ARSET (https://arset.gsfc.nasa.gov/); proposed projects may find it valuable to leverage resources and relationships with these capacity building activities.

Currently, creating decision support tools (DST) that effectively utilize remote sensing data requires significant efforts by experts in multiple domains. NASA Earth Science data, while accessible, is massive in breadth and scope – a true “Big Data” problem. However, the formatting of the data is not easily accessed or readily usable beyond remote sensing experts and the research community, suggesting that application by commercial users is even more challenging. While the data has commercial use, it is underutilized due to accessibility and translation issues. This creates a barrier to the widespread use of Earth observations by state and local governments, businesses, and the public. This subtopic aims to democratize the creation of Earth science driven decision support tools and to unleash a creative explosion of DST development that significantly increases the return on investment for Earth science missions. Specifically, this subtopic develops core capabilities that can be integrated to build multiple remote sensing driven DSTs customized to the requirements of different users in varied fields. Proven development and commercialization strategies will be used to meet these objectives. The goal of this solicitation is to directly link what is being done at NASA with the end user community to support decision making. The outcomes of this work could include new tools, integration systems, visualization interfaces, among others. Responsive proposals must include a clear identification of a data product(s), modeling tools, or NASA activities that will be used and a clear end user or business application to which the tools, systems, etc. are intended to support for applied research and decision support. Proposals should explain how the proposed capabilities will address an end user need, business opportunity or gap area in decision support capabilities. Proposals should also outline existing capabilities, including software, models, and data that are already implemented at NASA or through related NASA activities and how the proposed activities may leverage, complement, or expand from existing infrastructure. Projects must be mindful of NASA security restrictions in the development of new activities. Ultimately, this subtopic aims to provide commercial analytics firms and other data-driven companies with improved access to, and translation of, NASA data. The subtopic supports research and technology focused on innovative data science tools and information products that will improve business productivity, reduce the cost of operations, and provide for better informed decision making.

While there are many problems that can be addressed with ML/DL, the adoption of these techniques and technologies are slow due to the large learning curve associated with the application of this technology and the applicability of commercial and open source tools to specific problems of interest for NASA. This subtopic area seeks to close those gaps and accelerate the use of ML/DL across NASA Science and Engineering.

This SBIR subtopic is intended to solicit new enabling technologies as part of NASA’s response to this national objective. While this subtopic will consider all concepts demonstrably related to NASA’s Research-to-Operations/Operations-to-Research (R2O/O2R) responsibilities outlined in the NSWAP, four broad areas have been identified for priority development: NASA supports the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC), located at GSFC, as a centralized government-run facility that hosts, maintains, and validates heliophysics models, some of which will become suitable for use by the space weather operations and forecasting community. Innovations solicited include modernization of the CCMC core infrastructure, the preparation and validation of existing science models in preparation for transition to operations, and ideas for future models tied to space weather forecasting needs. Proposals directly tied to NASA's NSWAP activities may be given priority. Infrastructure improvement proposals should be coordinated with NASA CCMC requirements and needs, and outline the process for implementation, mitigations to ensure continued community access to CCMC resources throughout the transition process, and flexibilities that allow for future integration of additional modeling tools, archives, or repositories. For example, the CCMC is interested in technologies that enable utilization of high-end computing architectures to optimize system performance for tasks such as “runs on request (RoR). The Heliophysics System Observatory (HSO) data archives include a vast array of spacecraft observations suitable for the development of space weather benchmarks, which are the set of characteristics against which space weather events are measured. Baseline benchmarks have been established or are nearing completion. Innovations to further refine these benchmarks are solicited, as are concepts for future creative approaches utilizing new data types or models that could become available. Proposals should address the feasibility and utility of establishing any newly proposed functional benchmarks, preferably in coordination with one or more of the participating NSWAP agencies. A particular challenge is to combine the sparse, vastly distributed data sources with realistic models of the near-Earth space environment. Innovations across the broad range of data assimilation techniques are solicited, with the long-term goal of enabling future tools and protocols for the operations community. Proposals should address requirements that: Develop space weather applications or technologies desired by operational organizations that augment existing and future needs. Include the ability to integrate data from assets which typically do not share similar time series, utilize different measurement techniques (e.g., imaging vs in-situ particles and fields), and are distributed throughout the heliosphere. Specify that new forecasting tools which can be straightforwardly validated by the CCMC or other equally robust validation methodology. Examine the potential for integrating additional resources, such as ground based instrumentation e.g., USGS ground conductivity measurements which can be used to calculate geomagnetically induced currents. Heliophysics science relies on a wide variety of instrumentation for its research and often makes its data available in near-real-time for space weather forecasting purposes. Concepts are solicited for instrumentation concepts, flight architectures, and reporting systems that may be suitable for data assimilation into space weather monitoring and forecasting systems. This includes the miniaturization of existing systems and/or technologies deployable as an array of CubeSats. In order to be considered for investment, SBIR technologies should demonstrate comparable, or better, precision and accuracy when compared to the current state-of-the art. Further, SBIR instrument designs should avoid duplicating current NASA research spacecraft arrays or detector systems including those currently in formulation (e.g., SDO, Van Allen Probes, MMS, IMAP).

Focus Area 14 In-Space and Advanced Manufacturing,H7.01Development of Higher Strength Feedstocks for In-Space Manufacturing, MSFC, LaRC," TA12 Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems and Manufacturing", 2018,"There is a substantial rift between the properties of 3D printed thermoplastics (that can be produced with the current printers on the International Space Station) and the aerospace metals traditionally used in critical space systems. However, processes compatible with metals are more challenging from the perspective of operations in the space environment, often having volumes, powers, and safety hazards that may be incompatible with ISS requirements. As an alternative to adapting traditional AM of metals process to microgravity, this topic seeks development of higher strength feedstocks compatible with the FDM process that would uniquely enable NASA applications, facilitating sparing and/or palliative repair scenarios (the latter is where FDM would provide a stopgap solution until a more permanent fix could be developed). This work also has clear terrestrial benefits, as it stands to stands to significantly enhance the properties achievable with FDM techniques and expand the use of FDM processes for manufacturing beyond low-criticality applications. Proposers must clearly state how their development work under this opportunity advances the state of the art and enables new applications of AM. This SBIR subtopic is intended to investigate development of materials and/or post-processing techniques that will: Narrow the gap between the properties of materials produced using FDM techniques and metals. Result in much higher strength plastics with isotropic properties and improved dimensional tolerances. Homogenize material by reducing presence of pores. The solution may be obtained by a variety of approaches, including but not limited to: Novel post-processing or heat treatment techniques. Any techniques developed must be adaptable to the microgravity environment of ISS. Post-processing techniques must also preserve the characteristic dimensions of the part. Incorporation of nano or microfibers into filament feedstock. Benchtop materials development of high strength feedstock materials that are also extrudable with FDM. Feedstock materials which incorporate in-situ materials (such as those found on a planetary surface) and/or materials which represent polymer trash recyclables are of strong interest. Materials testing activities must be undertaken to demonstrate and quantify improvements in mechanical properties, densification, and dimensional accuracy possible with a proposed approach. Complementary modeling efforts are not required, but will be value added in establishing predictive relationships between processing conditions and material outcomes. Phase I SBIR is a feasibility demonstration and should provide: Development and implementation of new materials in FDM systems that represent a significant improvement over current material options. Materials testing and characterization to quantify material improvement over traditional FDM techniques or FDM manufactured material in the as-built condition. Proposed design approach for integrating methods developed into current or future ISM payloads for FDM as well as ground based machines and processes.

There are essentially two approaches to ensure consistency in the parts and the manufacturing process: a traditional qualification and certification (which may be difficult for ISM due to constraints on crew time and equipment size limitations) and online quality control (i.e., process monitoring, where in-situ monitoring of process signals provides information about the quality of the part produced by the process). Qualification and certification processes for ISM require better machine and feedback control than is currently available with off the shelf printers and other small manufacturing systems. While traditional approaches to qualification and certification are also being pursued, a more immediate solution is that of online/off-line quality control techniques that are adaptable to ISM. This SBIR seeks approaches to real-time, in-situ quality assurance of parts manufactured in the space environment and specifically focuses on manufacturing platforms similar to those used on ISS. The solicitation seeks methods that can be demonstrated for FDM or nonmetallic additive processes initially but are also broadly applicable to other candidate manufacturing processes for ISM, including AM of metallics and potentially even CNC machining. The latter technologies will likely be incorporated in to the Fabrication Laboratory in some capacity. Development of in-situ techniques for quality control applicable for ISM may utilize the following approaches or leverage other techniques not listed here: Online layer/trace monitoring would allow for rapid identification of defects as they are generated and well before the part is finished. In turn, this would allow for stoppage of the production run (thus conserving feedstock and lowering processing/recycling energy) or for the correction of defects by introducing layer compensation algorithms. Ideally, evaluation should occur with every layer (enabling corrective actions to be taken right away) but can also be done after a batch of layers. This approach may require: A multi-sensor approach and the ensuing data fusion and signal processing to extricate sensor data signatures that point to anomalies in the current print layer. This might include a combination of vision, structured light profilometry, thermography (IR), temperature, etc. Sensors and measurement methods are needed for: Dimension and geometry. Roughness and general surface finish. Defects, porosity and flaws. Feedstock tolerance. Energy source. Microstructure and mesostructured. Strength of the interlayer bonding. Residual stresses. Collection of extensive data that will help develop feedback systems, predictive processing and modeling capabilities. Defect taxonomies (type, frequency and size quantification) and algorithms will be needed to map the functional correlation between the type and size of defects and the potential impact on material composition and microstructure (thus mechanical and functional properties). Validation of modeling with process measurements to enable robust process control (e.g., vision system identifies a defect/pore and process control system corrects and eliminates defect). Use of statistical process control. Measurement of in-situ materials properties. In-situ, monitoring of operating conditions (e.g., temperature management and others) to reduce and control residual stresses and distortion. On-demand/adaptive post-processing based on actual thermal history of part Off-line quality control (nondestructive testing), including traditional finished part inspection and verification. Less desirable because it is post-mortem. Must be non-destructive testing. Computer Tomography (CT) and X-Ray analyses have become the norm for aerospace components. Others include visual and instrument-based inspection of dimensional accuracy, surface finish and perhaps some mechanical/physical properties. Likely to be intensive on crew time and limited by size of equipment. Phase I is a feasibility demonstration and should provide: Approach for in-situ quality control and verification of parts manufactured in space with clear adaptability to current and future ISM systems. Demonstration of approach: Sensors integrated into a ground based AM system (can be FDM initially), but has high extensibility to other processes that operate in a similar volume. Demonstrate that process signals acquired during build are correlated with and predictive of material outcomes (density, mechanical properties, other metrics) through a combination of material testing and statistical analysis. Phase II would focus on integration of the system in a NASA ground-based ISM platform as a demonstration and development of closed-loop control systems. Phase III would integrate the technique/NDE system into an ISM platform on ISS and verify its efficacy for V&V applications.

Common inks and dispersions used in inkjet printing and aerosol systems must be usable in plasma jet printers with proper nebulizers for extended deposition times. Throughput vs. plasma cylinder/nozzle diameter needs to be optimized with possibility of multiple nozzles that can be arranged in a showerhead configuration either to increase throughput or mix various types of feedstock for alloy-type materials. In Phase I, a print head that can print materials using plasma and tailor oxidation states of materials should be developed. The print head should have an integrated fluid delivery system that can work in microgravity environment and should use low weight power supply. A preliminary prototype printer demonstrating basic features of plasma printing is a preferred deliverable. In Phase II, the technology should be advanced by showing capability of printing a wide range of materials including organics, inorganics and others. The system also should be advanced by using appropriately sized electrical components, flow controllers etc. for meeting space operation needs and including an enclosure for trapping any airborne materials that would ensure safe use in closed environments such as the International Space Station. Atmospheric pressure plasma jet systems have cross cutting applications in sterilization and plasma treatment of surfaces as well.

In order to reliably use this process with a variety of materials for space flight applications, NASA has to have a much deeper understanding of the process. NASA is currently considering these processes for MOXIE, SHERLOC, ion engines and other spacecraft structural and multifunctional applications. Additive manufacturing of development and flight hardware with metallic alloys is being developed by NASA and its various partners for a variety of spacecraft applications. These components are expected to see extreme environments coupled with a need for high-reliability (e.g., manned spaceflight), which requires a deeper understanding of the manufacturing processes. Modeling of the additive processes to provide accurate dimensional designs, preferred microstructures and defect-free is a significant challenge that would dramatically benefit from a joint academic-industry approach. The objective would be to create process models that are compatible with current alloys systems and additive manufacturing equipment which will provide accurate prediction of outcomes from a variety of additive manufacturing process parameters and materials combinations. The primary alloys of interest to NASA at this time include: Inconel 625 & 718, stainless steels, such as 304 and 316, Al10SiMg, Ti-6Al-4V, and copper alloys (GrCop-84). It is desired that the modeling approach address a focused material system, but be readily adaptable to eventually accommodate all of these materials. Therefore, the model should incorporate modest parameter changes coupled with being easily extensible for future alloys of interest to NASA.

Focus Area 15 Lightweight Materials Structures and Assembly / Construction,H5.01Mars Surface Solar Array Structures, LaRC, GRC," TA12 Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems and Manufacturing", 2018,"Human missions to the Mars surface will require tens of kilowatts of electrical power for life support, science, in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), and other equipment. Possible power sources include nuclear reactors and solar arrays with batteries or regenerative fuel cells. Solar arrays are a mature, reliable technology used on most spacecraft and increasingly for Earth terrestrial power, and also at small sizes up to ~3 m2 for several successful Mars landers and rovers. However, human missions will need thousands of square meters of solar cells to generate the required power. Furthermore, the solar arrays must survive inevitable dust storms and possibly months of dormancy before and between crew visits. This subtopic seeks structural and mechanical innovations for solar arrays with at least 1000 m2 of total area that autonomously deploy from Mars landers. Design guidelines for these large deployable solar arrays are: Solar arrays must self-deploy. Total area: 1000 m2. Extensibility to 1500+ m2 is desirable. Mass goal: < 1.5 kg/m2 including all mechanical and electrical components. Packaging goal: < 10 m3 per 1000 m2 of deployed area. Launch loads: 5 g axial, 2 g lateral, 145 dB OASPL. Lander may not have azimuth control (i.e., guaranteed landing clocking angle). State all assumptions concerning array orientation and sun pointing. Solar arrays deploy in Mars 0.38 gravity and low winds (use 0.5 g for preliminary design). Solar arrays operate in Mars 0.38 gravity and wind gusts (use 1.0 g for preliminary design). Must survive peak winds of 50-100 m/s and simultaneous upward winds of 25-50 m/s (dust devils) with maximum air density of 0.023 kg/m3. Deployable on terrain with up to 0.5 m obstacles/depressions, 15 degree slopes, and potentially hidden hazards (e.g., sand-filled holes). Operating height > 0.5 m to avoid wind-blown sand collection. Time to deploy: < 8 hrs. Deployed strength: Ideally > 1 g to allow unconstrained Earth deployment qualification. Integrated dust abatement or removal methods. Dust accumulation is the #1 design risk issue for sustained solar power production on Mars. Tolerant of daily thermal cycling from -100° C to 25° C over a lifetime of 10-15 years. Describe the concept of operations (ConOps) including all packaging, deployment, and operating assumptions. This subtopic seeks innovations in the following areas for Mars solar array structures: Novel packaging, deployment, retraction, terrain-following ground supports, or in-situ assembly or manufacturing concepts. Lightweight, compact components including booms, ribs, substrates, and mechanisms. Load-limiting devices to avoid damage during extreme winds. Optimized use of advanced ultra-lightweight materials (but not materials development). Validated modeling, analysis, and simulation techniques. High-fidelity, functioning laboratory models and test methods. Proposals should emphasize structural and mechanical innovations, not photovoltaics, electrical, or energy storage innovations, although a complete solar array systems analysis is encouraged. If solar concentrators or solar tracking are proposed, strong arguments must be developed to justify why this approach is better from technical, cost, and risk points of view over fixed planar solar arrays. Of special interest are design innovations that improve NASA’s proposed solar array concepts using multiple Compact Telescoping Arrays (CTAs) as depicted on Charts 16-19 of Reference 2. Load alleviation methods to avoid damage during extreme winds are also of high interest. In Phase I, contractors should prove the feasibility of proposed innovations using suitable analyses and tests. In Phase II, significant hardware or software capabilities that can be tested at NASA should be developed to advance their Technology Readiness Level (TRL). TRLs at the end of Phase II of 3-4 or higher are desired. References: 1.

Focus Area 15 Lightweight Materials Structures and Assembly / Construction,T12.01Thin-Ply Composite Technology and Applications, LaRC, GRC," TA12 Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems and Manufacturing", 2018,"The use of thin-ply composites is one area of composites technology that has not yet been fully explored or exploited. Thin-ply composites are those with cured ply thicknesses below 0.0025 in. and commercially available prepregs are now available with ply thicknesses as thin as 0.00075 in. By comparison, a standard-ply-thickness composite would have a cured ply thickness of approximately 0.0055 in. or greater. Thin-ply composites hold the potential for reducing structural mass and increasing performance due to their unique structural characteristics, which include (when compared to standard-ply-thickness composites): Improved damage tolerance. Resistance to microcracking (including cryogenic-effects). Improved aging and fatigue resistance. Reduced minimum-gage thickness. Thinner sections capable of sustaining large deformations without damage. Increased scalability. These characteristics can make thin-ply composites attractive for a number of applications in both aeronautics and space. For example, preliminary analyses show that the notched strength of a hybrid of thin and standard ply layers can increase the notched tensile strength of composite laminates by 30%. Thus, selective incorporation of thin plies into composite aircraft structures may significantly reduce their mass. There are numerous possibilities for space applications. The resistance to microcracking and fatigue makes thin-ply composites an excellent candidate for a deep-space habitation structure where hermeticity is critical. Since the designs of these types of pressurized structures are typically constrained by minimum gage considerations, the ability to reduce that minimum gage thickness also offers the potential for significant mass reductions. For other space applications, the reduction in thickness enables: thin-walled, deployable structural concepts only a few plies thick that can be folded/rolled under high strains for launch (and thus have high packaging efficiencies) and deployed in orbit; and greater freedom in designing lightweight structures for satellite buses, landers, rovers, solar arrays, and antennas. For these reasons, NASA is interested in exploring the use of thin-ply composites for aeronautics applications requiring very high structural efficiency, for pressurized structures (such as habitation systems and tanks), for lightweight deep-space exploration systems, and for low-mass high stiffness deployable space structures (such as rollable booms or foldable panels, hinges or reflectors). There are many needs in development, qualification and deployment of composite structures incorporating thin-ply materials – either alone or as a hybrid system with standard ply composite materials. The particular capabilities requested for in a Phase I proposal in this subtopic are: New processing methods for making repeatable, consistent, high quality thin-ply carbon-fiber prepreg materials, (i.e., greater than 55% fiber density with low degree of fiber twisting, misalignment and damage, low thickness non-uniformity and minimal gaps in the material across the width). Prepreg product forms of interest have areal weights below 60 g/m2 for unidirectional tape with tape widths between 6 and 100 mm wide, and below 130 g/m2 for woven/braided prepreg materials. Matrices of interest include both toughened epoxy resins for aeronautics applications, and resins qualified for use in space. Initial process development in using thin-ply prepregs for component fabrication using automated tape layup or other robotic technologies. Contributing to the development of the design and qualification database though testing and interrogation of the structural response and damage initiation/progression at multiple scales including evaluation of environmental durability and ageing. Analysis and design tool validation and calibration to ensure that the technology to appropriately design, identify any application-specific shortcomings with suggested improvements, and certify thin-ply composite components is matured sufficiently to be used for NASA applications. Micromechanics models for spread-tow woven/braided laminates, including viscoelastic response. Development of testing methods adapted for thin-ply high-strain composite materials and structures, with particular interest to dedicated large deformation bending and creep tests. Engineering viscoelastic behavior of thin-ply laminates for controlled deployment of space structures. The intention of a Phase II follow-on effort would be to develop or to further mature the necessary design/analysis codes, and to validate the approach though design, build, and test of an article representative of the component/application of interest to NASA.

(Note: The robotic manipulation systems are not the subject of this solicitation.) The objective of this first subtopic area is to minimize the parasitic mass from the joints and modularity features that are required for inter-module assembly. The lightweight connections between modules must include both electrical (power and data) and structural connections.

Advanced materials to resist high-temperature (<4400° F), hydrogen embrittlement and harsh environments. Tools using computational methods to accurately model and predict system performance are required that integrate simple interfaces with detailed design and/or analysis software. SSC is interested in improving capabilities and methods to accurately predict and model the transient fluid structure interaction between cryogenic fluids and immersed components to predict the dynamic loads, frequency response of facilities. Improved capabilities to predict and model the behavior of components (valves, check valves, chokes, etc.) during the facility design process are needed. This capability is required for modeling components in high pressure (to 12,000 psi), with flow rates up to several thousand lb/sec, in cryogenic environments and must address two-phase flows. Challenges include accurate, efficient, thermodynamic state models; cavitation models for propellant tanks, valve flows, and run lines; reduction in solution time; improved stability; acoustic interactions; fluid-structure interactions in internal flows. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards Phase II hardware/software demonstration with delivery of a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.

Focus Area 16 Ground & Launch Processing,H10.02Autonomous Control Technologies (ACT) for Ground Operations, KSC," ARC, LaRC, SSC"," TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems", 2018,"Autonomous Control Technologies (ACT) are needed to reduce operations and maintenance costs of ground and payload operations and to increase the availability of systems to support mission operations. These technologies perform functions such as anomaly and fault detection, fault isolation, diagnostics and prognostics and enable variable levels of autonomous control and recovery of system operations, where recovery may include reconfiguration or repair. Autonomous Control Technologies are enabled by intelligent systems health management component technologies, methodologies, and approaches; command and control architectures; computing architectures; software for decision-making and control; and intelligent devices. ACT will be applied to operations such as autonomous propellant management, which includes the transfer, storage, measuring, and sampling of cryogenic, or other propellant for use in launch systems without requiring human interaction. Propellant management includes pre-planned nominal capabilities such as vehicle fill and drain as well as contingency and off-nominal capabilities such as emergency safing, venting and system reconfiguration. ACT capabilities will enable the autonomous monitoring and control of the integrated system resulting from the loading system and all other associated systems involved in the loading process. The system autonomy software itself includes both prerequisite control logic (PCL) and reaction control logic (RCL) programming, and may utilize some form of machine learning, neural network, or other form of artificial intelligence to adapt to degraded system components or other form of off-nominal conditions. In addition to cryogenic and other propellants, propellant management systems may utilize additional commodities to prepare a vehicle for launch, such as high-pressure gases for purges, pressurization, or conditioning, and may include power and data interfaces with the vehicle to configure vehicle valves or other internal systems and utilize on-board instrumentation to gain visibility into the vehicle during loading. ACT must also support tasks such as setup, testing and checkout, troubleshooting, maintenance, upgrades and repair. These additional tasks drive the need for autonomous element to element interface connection and separation, multi-element inspection, and recovery of high value cryogenic propellants and gases to avoid system losses. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II demonstration, and delivering a demonstration package for NASA testing in operational or analog test environments at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase I Deliverables - Research, identify and evaluate candidate technologies or concepts for systems and components fault detection, isolation and recovery, fault prediction and diagnosis, and decision-making algorithms for control to enable autonomy of ground systems. Demonstrate the technical feasibility, and show a path towards a demonstration. Concept methodology should include the path for adaptation of the technology, infusion strategies (including risk trades), and business model. It should identify improvements over the current state of the art for both operations and systems development and the feasibility of the approach in a multi-customer environment. Bench or lab-level demonstrations are desirable. Deliverables must include a report documenting findings. Phase II Deliverables - Emphasis should be placed on developing, prototyping and demonstrating the technology under simulated operational conditions using analog earth-based systems including dynamic events such as commodity loading, disconnect or engine testing. Deliverables shall include a report outlining the path showing how the technology could be matured and applied to mission-worthy systems, functional and performance test results and other associated documentation. Deliverable of a functional prototype (software and hardware) is expected at the completion of the Phase II contract. The technology concept at the end of Phase II should be at a TRL of 6 or higher.

Focus Area 17 Thermal Management Systems,Z2.01Thermal Management, JSC," GRC, GSFC, JPL, MSFC", TA14 Thermal Management Systems, 2018,"NASA seeks new technologies that will facilitate low mass and highly reliable thermal control systems for exploration vehicles. Broad topics of interest include development of: high efficiency lightweight radiators, advanced heat exchangers and cold plates, condensate separators with inlet air/water volume ratios greater than 99:1 and outlet separation efficiency of greater than 95%, phase change materials with optimized thermal capacity to structural mass ratios, high heat flux acquisition and transport devices, variable heat rejection technologies, closed-loop space suit thermal systems, high efficiency miniature pumped fluid systems, and improved thermal math modeling tools. Of particular interest in this solicitation are thermal control technologies that serve an integrated vehicle level function at a net mass benefit, those that enable human missions to Mars, and those enabling more than 24 hours of operation on the surface of Venus. Integrated Spacecraft Solutions The development of the systems required for spacecraft operations generally focus on providing a single primary function. Here, novel thermal control hardware that provides additional vehicle level functionality at a net mass benefit is sought. A concept of interest is body mounted radiators that provide effective micrometeoroid protection for deep space vehicles. Such a radiator must continuously provide its thermal control function while tolerating the micrometeoroid environment of cis-lunar space. The integrated radiator/micrometeoroid shield should have a radiator fin-efficiency better than 0.95. The shielding approach taken should provide a similar level of module and radiator flow tube protection as is currently in use on the International Space Station (ISS). The shielding configuration for ISS modules is 2 mm thick Al Alloy 6061 T6 stood off from the pressure vessel. The radiator tube shielding is a 1.2 mm thick aluminum bumper above a 4.75 mm gap, followed by a second 0.3 mm aluminum bumper over the flow tube. Another concept of interest includes flexible radiator solutions that could be integrated with existing inflatable structures. Flexible radiator solutions should meet a fin efficiency of at least 0.85 and provide radiative optical properties consistent with the current state of the art. Enabling Thermal Control Technologies Missions to Mars Operating large vehicles on the Martian surface presents unique challenges on a number of vehicle systems. During the entry, descent, and landing phase of the mission spacecraft surfaces are expected to experience incident heat loads up to 3.5 W/cm2 for up to 5 minutes over the course of entry. These heat fluxes result in radiative equilibrium temperatures between 500 K and 900K. As a result, vehicle components must either be isolated from these loads or tolerate the loads by design. Large pumped fluid loop radiators, as the currently exist, were not designed to tolerate these types of external loads. Here NASA seeks new highly efficient radiator designs that are capable of surviving the described entry environment. Radiator designs should target mass to area ratios better than 5.4 kg/m2. In addition to external loads experienced through the entry phase, the vehicle must also be capable of managing its own heat load. Concepts that incorporate both external environment tolerance and vehicle thermal management are desired. Thermal Systems for Surface Missions to Venus Proposals are sought for enabling thermal technology systems for the in-situ planetary exploration of deep atmosphere and surface environments. A driving scenario is exploration of the surface of Venus through the use of long-lived (> day) landers. Venus features a dense, CO2 atmosphere completely covered by clouds with sulfuric acid aerosols, a surface temperature of 760K, and a surface pressure of 90 atmospheres. Thermal technologies are needed that permit more than 24 hours of operation of internal components within a 1 m diameter pressure vessel while minimizing resources consumed by the thermal system. A total systems approach must be considered that may include, but are not limited to, novel insulation, energy storage, heat pumping, and expendable coolant systems.

Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,A1.03Low Emissions/Clean Power - Combustion Technology/Emissions Measurement Techniques, GRC, LaRC, TA15 Aeronautics, 2018,"Achieving low emissions and finding new pathways to cleaner power are critical for the development of future air vehicles. Vehicles for subsonic and supersonic flight regimes will be required to operate on a variety of certified aircraft fuels and emit extremely low amounts of gaseous and particulate emissions to satisfy increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Future vehicles will be more fuel-efficient which will result in smaller engine cores operating at higher pressures. Future combustors will also likely employ lean burn concepts which are more susceptible to combustion instabilities. Fundamental combustion research coupled with associated physics based model development of combustion processes will provide the foundation for technology development critical for these vehicles. Combustion involves multi-phase, multi-component fuel, turbulent, unsteady, 3D, reacting flows where much of the physics of the processes are not completely understood. CFD codes used for combustion do not currently have the predictive capability that is typically found for non-reacting flows. Low emissions combustion concepts require very rapid mixing of the fuel and air with a minimum pressure loss to achieve complete combustion in the smallest volume. Areas of specific interest where research is solicited include: Development of laser-based diagnostics for quantitative spatially and temporally resolved measurements of fuel/air ratio in reacting flows at elevated pressure. Development of ultra-sensitive instruments for determining the size-dependent mass of combustion generated particle emissions. Low emissions combustor concepts for small high pressure engine cores. Development of miniature high-frequency fuel modulation valve for combustion instability control able to withstand the surrounding high-temperature air environment.

Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,A1.04Supersonic Technology - Reduce Take-off and Landing Noise, GRC, LaRC, TA15 Aeronautics, 2018,"This solicitation is aimed at further exploring technologies that reduce landing and take-off noise while maintaining range and sonic boom within acceptable levels. This may include innovations in propulsion design, propulsion-airframe integration, vehicle operations, and high-lift airframe elements. A concept vehicle with low-boom configurations such as those identified in the above references is desired; however, other operational concepts, for example those not involving overland supersonic flight may be considered if there is an overlap in technology benefits. The following list summarizes the topics for which proposals are sought in this solicitation. Details for each topic area are provided in the following section: Topic 2.1 - Innovative High Lift Concepts for Highly Swept Supersonic Wings. Topic 2.2 - Alternative Variable Propulsion Architectures. Topic 2.3 - Efficient Optimization of Supersonic Nozzles to Minimize Jet Noise. Topic 2.1 - Innovative High Lift Concepts for Highly Swept Supersonic Wings. Objective This topic seeks innovative high lift concept proposals that would enable takeoff and landing noise levels that meet certification requirements (consistent with those of the subsonic fleet), have minimal to no impact on supersonic performance, and are compatible with low-boom vehicle designs. Each concept should include a preliminary assessment of its performance at takeoff/landing speeds, its component noise, and an assessment of its impact on likely laminar flow requirements. Approach The high-lift system is an integral part of the take-off, landing, stall recovery, and low-altitude maneuvering segments of a supersonic aircraft’s mission. Low-aspect ratio, thin, highly swept wings typical of supersonic aircraft generally do not perform well at low speed and present challenges to designing a high lift system. For modern supersonic aircraft, high lift systems not only need to enable good takeoff and landing performance, but also need to be quiet and stow so as to not interfere with natural laminar flow leading-edge design approaches that may be under consideration. Any high-lift system should also delay or reduce undesirable pitch characteristics. Modern supersonic aircraft may have to meet the same low-noise requirements near an airport that subsonic aircraft do. Therefore, high-lift systems must have good performance to get the aircraft as high as possible over the “cutback” measurement point, and be low-noise for the approach-to-landing measurement point. An estimate of component noise will be required for all proposed high lift concepts and the basis of that estimate provided. As an example, continuous mold-line flaps have been investigated for subsonic aircraft and may be also be applicable on supersonic aircraft. Therefore, the subsonic studies would serve as a basis for the estimate of the component noise in a supersonic application. If there are no relevant studies for a particular concept, a proposal for such a study should be included. Wing leading-edge laminar flow design technology may include a sufficiently small wing leading-edge radius (to manage supersonic attachment-line flow transition associated with leading-edge boundary-layer contamination/stability) as well as certain leading-edge treatments (to manage insect/debris contamination and cross-flow transition). Technology enabling wing leading-edge radius variations ranging from a large radius for use at low-speed conditions to a small radius for use at supersonic conditions may be considered. The leading-edge high-lift system shall minimize any steps/gaps/sealing issues when stowed for the supersonic cruise configuration. The trailing-edge high-lift system is not a concern for the laminar flow wing design, but still needs to address steps/gaps/sealing issues to minimize drag for supersonic cruise efficiency requirements. Although a subtle distinction, the laminar-flow requirement only applies to the supersonic cruise conditions; for low-speed conditions, a turbulent high-lift wing configuration may be more robust and preferable to meet these challenging high-lift requirements. Ideas considered in previous supersonic research efforts (which had L/D requirements, but not low-noise or laminar-friendly requirements) included simply-hinged leading- and trailing-edge flaps. Questions remain regarding the adequacy of the performance of these concepts, given the more stringent criteria stated above. Under a prior NRA contract, a baseline commercial passenger concept was developed for the Commercial Supersonic Technology Project. This representative mid-term configuration can be used to evaluate the proposed high lift concepts. The proposed approach should involve multiple stages of activity if more than one concept is being investigated. During initial studies open trade spaces are encouraged. Through quarterly technical interchanges with the NASA team, it is anticipated that a down-select or prioritization of the most viable concepts will occur and will be more fully developed through CFD or experimental studies. Outcome: This effort will result in: A suite of high-lift concepts, evaluated for low-speed performance (L/D), component noise, and “laminar-friendliness.” The most promising of these concepts will subsequently be used for experimental or high-fidelity computational proof-of-concept investigations on a relevant supersonic transport wing geometry.

The work will consider three-dimensional inlet and nozzle geometries and perform analysis of key propulsion efficiency trades, flight envelope operability, and propulsion noise at the Landing Take-Off phases of flight. Background To satisfy the increasing stringency of commercial Landing/Take-Off (LTO) noise, efficient supersonic cruise propulsion systems would ideally operate at high mass flow for take-off (low jet velocity) and safely transition to high specific thrust (high jet velocity) for supersonic operation. In recent decades, variable cycle technologies have afforded a measure of success in this pursuit, with some compromise in propulsion system weight and complexity [1]. Most recently, tip-fan versions of a variable cycle engine have been explored as a way to invoke higher fan mass flows at take-off with higher installed specific thrust for cruise3. Additional alternative concepts have also been expressed (e.g., mixer-ejector nozzles, supplemental mechanical/electric fans, or other concepts) to reconcile the dichotomy of high flow acoustic take-off with efficient supersonic cruise. Historically, however, all such variable propulsion systems have suffered size, weight, and realizability issues adversely affecting vehicle integration and cruise range performance. Furthermore, development of a propulsion system with such unique operating characteristics has challenged the economics of limited production supersonic vehicles. While a number of such variable propulsion concepts have been contemplated for commercial supersonics to date, many have yet to be explored with modern analysis tools/methods or at a sufficiently credible level of detail or with an eye toward reducing uncertainty. Lack of realistic geometry including inlet, nozzle, and vehicle integration have oversimplified or obviated issues with such concepts as flow valves and moving surfaces that transition throughout the flight envelope. In addition to new concepts, use of modern design methods may allow reconsideration of some alternative propulsion architectures but with greater design realism in overcoming prior associated technical roadblocks. Vehicle integration for low sonic boom and supersonic drag has also been a major issue impacting the utility of high flow propulsion concepts as these considerations value minimizing nacelle cross-sectional area or fineness ratio. Correspondingly, engine/accessories packaging, inlet and nozzle interfaces, and integration with endemic features of supersonic vehicles must be considered (e.g., highly swept thin wings, propulsion in-board or aft-fuselage mounting and boundary-layer diversion). Approaches A set of metrics, including mass flow variability, cruise efficiency, range, and airport noise should be developed to evaluate alternative variable propulsion architectures. Promising alternative variable propulsion architectures should be evaluated using low-fidelity system analysis on a representative supersonic aircraft mission. Low-boom aircraft concepts, such as those referenced in published system studies4-10 may be used as a point of departure. Furthermore, propulsion approaches that modify existing or more “conventional” propulsion architectures are of key interest for achieving large changes in effective bypass ratio or specific thrust in an economical approach. In their search for innovative concepts, proposers are encouraged to seek partnerships with non-traditional industries, large and small engine manufacturers, and universities with capabilities to explore credible levels of detail and reduced uncertainty. Outcome A final report (non-proprietary and proprietary (if required) versions) is expected at the conclusion of this effort showing at least one conceptual propulsion configuration with a two-fold variability in effective bypass ratio, capable of powering a representative Mach 1.4-1.8 commercial supersonic transport sized for range of at least 4000 nautical miles and 8 - 90 passengers. The following items should be included in the final report: One to a few alternative variable propulsion concepts, investigated to a credible design level and accompanied by supporting trade studies of key design parameters. Engine cross-section(s) including outer dimensions and component weights (at a minimum). Three-dimensional geometry representations of inlet, nozzle and key components, with appropriate characterization for use in propulsion system model(s). Propulsion system model(s) (preferably in NPSS) and assumptions, with recommendations for further development of key technologies or components. Installed propulsion performance throughout a representative flight operating envelope.

Topic 2.3: Efficient Optimization of Supersonic Nozzles to Minimize Jet Noise Objective The objective of this subtopic is to apply optimization methodology to problems in aeroacoustics, specifically to minimize jet noise of future commercial supersonic nozzle designs and installations. Background Currently, predicting the noise of a non-axisymmetric jet requires either time-accurate computation using Large Eddy Simulation, which is very expensive but potentially very accurate, or Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) CFD and acoustic source modeling, which is cheaper but has failed to provide absolute accuracies needed for design. The latter methods have demonstrated the capability to predict trends in noise from variations in nozzle geometry, however, and this capability may be harnessed to do optimization of nozzle geometries to minimize the jet noise. In the time-average methods, the flow solution can be obtained from a RANS-based CFD code, the noise produced from the flow can be computed using an established NASA code, and the transformation of the sound spectra to that of an overhead flight and its EPNL metric is given in FAA documentation. Approach The vision is that RANS-based methods which predict the noise of an engine nozzle for a given flow condition can be applied in optimization to reduce noise by varying the nozzle shape and/or installation. A successful effort would utilize NASA jet noise prediction knowledge and tools, determine viable optimization strategies and methods that are appropriate for these tools, and demonstrate the system by applying it to a nozzle design problem of interest to NASA. Using a suitable optimization methodology, the proposer would develop a coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics-Computational Aero-acoustics (CFD-CAA) optimization system to find the minimum EPNL metric for a given set of geometric design parameters that describe the nozzle shape. It is expected the process would be suitable for designing three-dimensional, multi-stream, and unconventional nozzle concepts. Given the dependence on high-fidelity RANS computations for jet noise prediction, an efficient optimization process that utilizes gradient information (e.g. a continuous or discrete adjoint approach) is desired. Ideally, the CFD-CAA system will be developed to leverage and/or easily interface with adjoint-capable CFD codes like NASA’s Fully Unstructured Navier-Stokes 3D (FUN3D)3 framework, or similar.

Each concept should include a preliminary assessment of its performance at takeoff/landing speeds, its component noise, and an assessment of its impact on likely laminar flow requirements.
","The high-lift system is an integral part of the take-off, landing, stall recovery, and low-altitude maneuvering segments of a supersonic aircraft’s mission. Low-aspect ratio, thin, highly swept wings typical of supersonic aircraft generally do not perform well at low speed and present challenges to designing a high lift system. For modern supersonic aircraft, high lift systems not only need to enable good takeoff and landing performance, but also need to be quiet and stow so as to not interfere with natural laminar flow leading-edge design approaches that may be under consideration. Any high-lift system should also delay or reduce undesirable pitch characteristics.
Modern supersonic aircraft may have to meet the same low-noise requirements near an airport that subsonic aircraft do. Therefore, high-lift systems must have good performance to get the aircraft as high as possible over the “cutback” measurement point, and be low-noise for the approach-to-landing measurement point. An estimate of component noise will be required for all proposed high lift concepts and the basis of that estimate provided. As an example, continuous mold-line flaps have been investigated for subsonic aircraft and may be also be applicable on supersonic aircraft. Therefore, the subsonic studies would serve as a basis for the estimate of the component noise in a supersonic application. If there are no relevant studies for a particular concept, a proposal for such a study should be included.
Wing leading-edge laminar flow design technology may include a sufficiently small wing leading-edge radius (to manage supersonic attachment-line flow transition associated with leading-edge boundary-layer contamination/stability) as well as certain leading-edge treatments (to manage insect/debris contamination and cross-flow transition). Technology enabling wing leading-edge radius variations ranging from a large radius for use at low-speed conditions to a small radius for use at supersonic conditions may be considered. The leading-edge high-lift system shall minimize any steps/gaps/sealing issues when stowed for the supersonic cruise configuration. The trailing-edge high-lift system is not a concern for the laminar flow wing design, but still needs to address steps/gaps/sealing issues to minimize drag for supersonic cruise efficiency requirements. Although a subtle distinction, the laminar-flow requirement only applies to the supersonic cruise conditions; for low-speed conditions, a turbulent high-lift wing configuration may be more robust and preferable to meet these challenging high-lift requirements.
Ideas considered in previous supersonic research efforts (which had L/D requirements, but not low-noise or laminar-friendly requirements) included simply-hinged leading- and trailing-edge flaps. Questions remain regarding the adequacy of the performance of these concepts, given the more stringent criteria stated above.
Under a prior NRA contract, a baseline commercial passenger concept was developed for the Commercial Supersonic Technology Project. This representative mid-term configuration can be used to evaluate the proposed high lift concepts.
The proposed approach should involve multiple stages of activity if more than one concept is being investigated. During initial studies open trade spaces are encouraged. Through quarterly technical interchanges with the NASA team, it is anticipated that a down-select or prioritization of the most viable concepts will occur and will be more fully developed through CFD or experimental studies.
","This effort will result in:
A suite of high-lift concepts, evaluated for low-speed performance (L/D), component noise, and “laminar-friendliness.” The most promising of these concepts will subsequently be used for experimental or high-fidelity computational proof-of-concept investigations on a relevant supersonic transport wing geometry. Complete documentation of findings and relevant comparisons. Recommendations for follow-on studies.

","To satisfy the increasing stringency of commercial Landing/Take-Off (LTO) noise, efficient supersonic cruise propulsion systems would ideally operate at high mass flow for take-off (low jet velocity) and safely transition to high specific thrust (high jet velocity) for supersonic operation. In recent decades, variable cycle technologies have afforded a measure of success in this pursuit, with some compromise in propulsion system weight and complexity [1]. Most recently, tip-fan versions of a variable cycle engine have been explored as a way to invoke higher fan mass flows at take-off with higher installed specific thrust for cruise3. Additional alternative concepts have also been expressed (e.g., mixer-ejector nozzles, supplemental mechanical/electric fans, or other concepts) to reconcile the dichotomy of high flow acoustic take-off with efficient supersonic cruise. Historically, however, all such variable propulsion systems have suffered size, weight, and realizability issues adversely affecting vehicle integration and cruise range performance. Furthermore, development of a propulsion system with such unique operating characteristics has challenged the economics of limited production supersonic vehicles.
While a number of such variable propulsion concepts have been contemplated for commercial supersonics to date, many have yet to be explored with modern analysis tools/methods or at a sufficiently credible level of detail or with an eye toward reducing uncertainty. Lack of realistic geometry including inlet, nozzle, and vehicle integration have oversimplified or obviated issues with such concepts as flow valves and moving surfaces that transition throughout the flight envelope. In addition to new concepts, use of modern design methods may allow reconsideration of some alternative propulsion architectures but with greater design realism in overcoming prior associated technical roadblocks. Vehicle integration for low sonic boom and supersonic drag has also been a major issue impacting the utility of high flow propulsion concepts as these considerations value minimizing nacelle cross-sectional area or fineness ratio. Correspondingly, engine/accessories packaging, inlet and nozzle interfaces, and integration with endemic features of supersonic vehicles must be considered (e.g., highly swept thin wings, propulsion in-board or aft-fuselage mounting and boundary-layer diversion).
","A set of metrics, including mass flow variability, cruise efficiency, range, and airport noise should be developed to evaluate alternative variable propulsion architectures. Promising alternative variable propulsion architectures should be evaluated using low-fidelity system analysis on a representative supersonic aircraft mission. Low-boom aircraft concepts, such as those referenced in published system studies4-10 may be used as a point of departure. Furthermore, propulsion approaches that modify existing or more “conventional” propulsion architectures are of key interest for achieving large changes in effective bypass ratio or specific thrust in an economical approach.
In their search for innovative concepts, proposers are encouraged to seek partnerships with non-traditional industries, large and small engine manufacturers, and universities with capabilities to explore credible levels of detail and reduced uncertainty.

","Currently, predicting the noise of a non-axisymmetric jet requires either time-accurate computation using Large Eddy Simulation, which is very expensive but potentially very accurate, or Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) CFD and acoustic source modeling, which is cheaper but has failed to provide absolute accuracies needed for design. The latter methods have demonstrated the capability to predict trends in noise from variations in nozzle geometry, however, and this capability may be harnessed to do optimization of nozzle geometries to minimize the jet noise. In the time-average methods, the flow solution can be obtained from a RANS-based CFD code, the noise produced from the flow can be computed using an established NASA code, and the transformation of the sound spectra to that of an overhead flight and its EPNL metric is given in FAA documentation.

Areas of research that help to significantly reduce CFD workflow are the subject of this solicitation. It was recognized that the generation of meshes suitable for high-accuracy CFD simulations constitutes a principal bottleneck in the simulation workflow process as it requires significant human intervention. As more capable high performance computing (HPC) hardware enables higher resolution simulations, fast, reliable mesh generation and adaptivity will become more problematic. The other area of research pertains to extracting knowledge of physical relevance from computed and experimental data from wind tunnels and flight. To enable accurate CFD solutions for complex configurations, proposals are solicited for generating unstructured and mixed-element meshes for accurate flow solutions. The new capability will be demonstrated for configurations of interest to NASA aeronautics (http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/programs.htm) in terms of accuracy, speed and robustness. Of particular interest is the NASA juncture flow model (AIAA Paper 2016-1557) for which grids suitable for unsteady flow simulations (e.g., large eddy simulation (LES) and wall-modeled LES) needs to be generated. Another potential test case is the aircraft landing gear requiring hybrid RANS/LES solutions. The metrics for success are the quality and speed of grid generation. The proposers must present a convincing case that the proposed approach has the potential for dramatic decrease in CFD workflow time while generating quality grids that would produce physically relevant results. Proposers should also specify how the grid quality will be determined. The second area of research for which proposals are solicited pertain to merging of high-fidelity CFD simulations with other aerodynamic data. With wind tunnel and flight testing still expected to play a key role in the aerospace system design process, methods to merge and assimilate CFD simulation data with other experimental/computational data sources to create an integrated database, including some measure of confidence level and/or uncertainty of all (or individual) portions of the database, are required. Currently, the merging of large amounts of experimental and variable fidelity computational data is mostly carried out through experience and intuition using fairly unsophisticated tools. Well-founded mathematically and statistically-based approaches are required for merging such data, for eliminating outlier numerical solutions as well as experimental points, and for generally quantifying the level of uncertainties throughout the data base. Phase I research is expected to develop the technology and demonstrate it on relatively simpler configurations, while Phase II will increase the technology readiness level and include demonstration for more complex flow configurations.

UAM passengers can select a trip origin, destination and timing without being aggregated with many other air travelers. An emerging UAM market will require a high density of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) operations for on-demand, affordable, quiet, and fast transportation in a scalable and conveniently-accessible “vertiport” network. It is envisioned that UAM will provide increased mobility within a given metropolitan area by flying faster, and using shorter (< 100 miles) and more direct routing as compared to ground vehicles. UAM vehicles are assumed to require various degrees of autonomous operations to reach their full potential as the concepts are implemented and the market develops. A series of workshops with NASA, FAA, academia, and industry were held over the past few years to discuss the potential benefits and challenges of UAM. The outcomes of these workshops, including technology roadmaps, are available at http://www.nianet.org/ODM/roadmap.htm(link is external). Growth of UAM is dependent on affordable, low-noise VTOL configurations, which may be enabled by electric aircraft propulsion technologies, and the ability of these vehicles to operate within densely populated urban areas in most weather conditions including low altitude operations in rain, ice, wind, and turbulence.

They play an integral role in the design, development, evaluation, and analysis of advanced aerospace technologies and vehicles. These facilities provide critical data and fundamental insight required to understand complex phenomena and support the advancement of computational tools for modeling and simulation. The primary objective of the Aeronautics Ground Test and Measurements Technologies subtopic is to develop innovative tools and technologies that can be applied in NASA’s aeroscience ground test facilities to revolutionize testing and measurement capabilities and improve utilization and efficiency. Of primary interest are technologies which can be applied to NASA’s portfolio of large-scale ground test facilities [1]. For this solicitation, NASA seeks proposals for innovative research and development in the following areas: Wind Tunnel Calibration and Characterization - Capabilities for wind tunnel calibration and characterization are critical for overall enhancement of facilities and will play a critical role in achieving the CFD 2030 Vision [2]. Systems that can provide planar or volumetric measurements of flow quantities such as velocity, density, temperature, and pressure in the airflow upstream, around, and downstream of test articles are required to quantify tunnel inflow and outflow conditions and specify boundary conditions for numerical simulations. Model Attitude, Position and/or Shape Sensing - Measurements of test article attitude and position (e.g., roll, pitch, and yaw angles and spatial coordinates X, Y, Z of a wind tunnel model or other structure under test) are critical but are often difficult to make due to packaging constraints and model orientations where gravity based sensors are not applicable. To address some of these limitations, optical and non-optical techniques are needed to provide real-time or near real-time measurements of model attitude at data rates of up to 100 Hz and with sufficient accuracy (0.005± 0.0025 degrees in pitch 0.025±0.025 degrees in roll and yaw). For some applications, dynamic surface shape measurement techniques are needed at rates exceeding 10 kHz. Technologies for Engine Simulators - The need to assess aerodynamic performance at higher system levels with respect to fuel-burn and noise has created a great demand for propulsion-airframe integration (PAI) testing. Such tests use engine simulators which generate properly-scaled flows in the model. Currently, PAI tests can be quite expensive due to issues related to the integration of the simulator into the model, reliability, complexity of the calibration, and the high-pressure air and/or power which must cross the force and moment balance. NASA seeks innovative propulsion simulators that are more compact and capable of recreating the speed and volume of actual propulsion systems, including approach and landing conditions for the assessment of airframe noise. Hydraulic, pneumatic, electric, or hybrid approaches are solicited. NASA also seeks innovative measurement systems and techniques for monitoring and evaluating the performance of these simulators. Of interest are systems that can measure loads on individual blades for studies involving boundary layer ingestion, and balances capable of transferring high pressure air and/or power across the balance and operating at high temperatures (up to 350° F).

Seal preloading elements, in various spring-like forms, can be incorporated within or behind a seal to provide the required resiliency. Spring tubes knitted from high temperature wire materials have been used inside high temperature seals, but they have been shown to lose resiliency and take on a permanent set at temperatures as low as 1200° F. Compression springs, canted coil springs, wave springs, and other unique configurations have all been evaluated as preload devices behind a seal with varying levels of success. For each design, though, material selection was a driving factor in the amount of resiliency exhibited by each type of seal preload device. Therefore, unique combinations of materials and designs will be required to achieve improved resiliency at the higher temperatures anticipated for future seal applications. NASA is interested in developing spring-like devices made of ceramic materials (e.g., silicon nitride) to use as preloading-seal elements applicable to these challenging environments. The overall goal is to develop seals that remain in contact with opposing sealing surfaces at higher temperatures for longer periods of time than current state of the art designs thus making them more reusable.

Focus Area 19 Integrated Flight Systems,A2.02Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Technologies, AFRC," ARC, GRC, LaRC"," TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems", 2018,"Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) offer advantages over manned aircraft for applications which are dangerous to humans, long in duration, require great precision, and require quick reaction. Examples of such applications include remote sensing, disaster response, delivery of goods, agricultural support, and many others that are known or yet to be discovered. In addition, the future of UAS promises great economic and operational advantages by requiring less human participation, less human training, an ability to take-off and land at any location, and the ability to react to dynamic situations. NASA is involved in research that would greatly benefit from breakthroughs in UAS capabilities. Flight research of basic aerodynamics and advanced aero-vehicle concept would be revolutionized with an ability of UAS teams to cooperate and interact while making real time decisions based upon sensor data with little human oversight. Commercial industry would likewise be revolutionized with such abilities. There are multiple technological barriers that are restricting greater use and application of UAS in NASA research and in civil aviation. These barriers include, but are not limited to, the lack of methods, architectures, and tools which enable: The verification, validation, and certification of complex and/or nondeterministic systems. Humans to operate multiple UAS with minimal oversight. Multi-vehicle cooperation and interoperability. High level machine perception, cognition, and decision-making. Inexpensive secure and reliable communications. This solicitation is intended to break through these and other barriers with innovative and high-risk research. The Integrated Aviation Systems Program's work on UAS Technology for the FY 2018 NASA SBIR solicitation is focused on breaking through barriers to enable greater use of UAS in NASA research and in civil aviation use.

Operation of Multiple UAS with Minimal Human Oversight - Novel methods, software, and hardware that enable the operation of multiple UAS by a single human with minimal oversight need to be developed which ensure robust and safe operations. Proposed research could include novel hardware and software architectures which provide guarantees of safe UAS operations. Multi-Vehicle Cooperation and Interoperability - Technologies that enable UAS to interact in teams, including legacy vehicles, need to be developed. This includes technologies that enable UAS to negotiate with others to find optimal routes, optimal task allocations, and optimal use of resources. Proposed research could include hardware and software architectures which enable UAS to operate in large cooperative and interactive teams. Sensing, Perception, Cognition, and Decision Making - Technologies need to be developed that provide the ability of UAS to detect and extract internal and external information of the vehicle, transform the raw data into abstract information which can be understood by machines or humans, and recognize patterns and make decisions based on the data and patterns. Inexpensive, Reliable, and Secure Communications - Inexpensive methods which ensure reliable and secure communications for increasingly interconnected and complex networks need to be developed that are immune from sophisticated cyber-physical attacks.

Focus Area 20 Airspace Operations and Safety,A3.02Increasing Autonomy in the National Airspace Systems (NAS) (not vehicles), ARC, LaRC, TA15 Aeronautics, 2018,"NASA's research envisions future concepts for air transportation that will significantly expand the current nature of airspace and vehicle management with an increasing reliance on autonomy technologies. Growing numbers of operations and a wider range of vehicle performance and mission goals will not be realizable in the current airspace system, and it is expected that a new service-based architecture, with features derived from NASA's Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM) model, will provide the flexibility to support future use cases while establishing the necessary constraints to ensure safe and equitable operations. New technologies will be used to empower user decision making and collaboration with other users and the Air Navigation Service Provider. NASA’s near-term goal for UTM itself is the development and demonstration of the concept to safely enable low-altitude airspace and UAS operations within the next five years. For the longer-term (10 to 15 years in the future), the goal is to safely enable the anticipated dramatic increase in density of all low-altitude airspace operations. NASA is partnered with other government agencies, industry, and academia, to perform the research, development, testing, and implementation of UTM. This subtopic addresses the application of autonomy towards improving mobility, scalability, efficiency, safety, and cost-competitiveness, with particular attention towards the needs of emergent users and their operations (e.g., frequent, domestic supersonic flights, and commercial space launches to Urban Air Mobility and regional air-taxi operations) and enabling human operators to efficiently and effectively manage civilian low-altitude unmanned aircraft system (UAS) operations (UAS traffic management, or UTM) across a range of potential use cases (e.g., public safety/search and rescue, infrastructure inspection/surveillance, agricultural applications, cargo delivery, hobbyist, etc.). Proposals in the following areas are sought, but are not limited to: Autonomous or increasing levels of autonomy for, or towards, managing networked vehicle cockpits in all airspace domains (e.g., airport, metroplex, en route, regional/national traffic flow management, integration of multiple domains, on-demand aircraft and operations, and non-towered airports and vertiports). Autonomicity (or self-management) -based architectures for the entirety, or parts, of airspace operations.

Focus Area 20 Airspace Operations and Safety,A3.03Future Aviation Systems Safety, ARC, LaRC, TA15 Aeronautics, 2018,"Public benefits derived from continued growth in the transport of passengers and cargo are dependent on the improvement of the intrinsic safety attributes of the Nation’s and the world’s current and future air transportation system. Recent developments to address increasing demand are leading to greater system complexity, including airspace systems with tightly coupled air and ground functions as well as widely distributed and integrated aircraft systems. Current methods of ensuring that designs meet desired safety levels will likely not scale to these levels of complexity (Aeronautics R&D Plan, p. 30). The Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP) is addressing this challenge with a major area of focus on real-time system-wide safety assurance (RSSA). A proactive approach to managing system safety requires: The ability to monitor the system continuously and to extract and fuse information from diverse data sources to identify emergent anomalous behaviors after new technologies, procedures, and training are introduced. The ability to reliably predict probabilities of the occurrence of hazardous events and of their safety risks. Understanding and predicting system-wide safety concerns of the airspace system and the vehicles as envisioned by NextGen is paramount. Such a system would include the emergent effects of increased use of automation and autonomy to enhance system capabilities, efficiency and performance beyond current, human-based systems, through health monitoring of system-wide functions that are integrated across distributed ground, air, and space systems. Emerging highly autonomous operations such as those envisioned for UAS and on-demand air mobility (ODM) will play a major role in future airspace systems. In particular, operating beyond the operator’s visual line-of-sight (BVLOS) and near or over populated areas are topics of concern. Safety-critical risks include: Flight outside of approved airspace. Unsafe proximity to people/property. Critical system failure (including loss of C2 link, loss or degraded GPS, loss of power, and engine failure). Loss-of-control (i.e., outside the envelope or flight control system failure). Tools are being sought for use in creating prototypes of RSSA capabilities. The ultimate vision for RSSA is the delivery of a progression of capabilities that accelerate the detection, prognosis and resolution of system-wide threats. Proposals under this subtopic are sought, but not limited to, these areas (with an emphasis on safety applications): Develop data collection architecture, data exchange model and data collection mechanism (for example via UTM TCL-4). Develop and demonstrate data mining tools and techniques to detect and identify anomalies and precursors to safety threats system-wide.

Focus Area 21 Small Spacecraft Technologies,T1.01Affordable Nano/Micro Launch Propulsion Stages, MSFC, AFRC, TA1 Launch Propulsion Systems, 2018,"NASA is recognizing a growing demand for dedicated, responsive small spacecraft launch systems and seeks to facilitate the establishment of a robust launch service provider market sector. The movement toward small spacecraft missions is largely driven by rising development/launch costs associated with conventional spacecraft, which poses severe threats to future science/commercial mission cadence, and by rapidly evolving miniaturization innovations that are revolutionizing small spacecraft platform capabilities. This topic seeks innovative technologies, subsystems, and efficient streamlined processes that will support the development of affordable small spacecraft launch systems having a 5-180 kg payload delivery capacity to 350 to 700 km at inclinations between 28 to 98.2 degrees to support both CONUS and sun synchronous operations. Affordability objectives are focused on reducing launch costs below $1.5M/launch for payloads ranging up to 50 kg or below $30,000/kg for payloads in excess of 50 kg. It is recognized that no single enabling technology is likely to achieve this goal and that a combination of multiple technologies and production practices are likely to be needed. Therefore, it is highly desirable that disparate but complementary technologies formulate and use standardized plug-and-play interfaces to better allow for transition and integration into small spacecraft launch systems. This subtopic seeks to mature innovative ideas providing a pipeline of components, processes, technologies, propellants, and materials that enhance propulsive performance or that enable adequate propulsive performance at a significant cost savings. Innovations submitted under this subtopic must focus on meeting the affordability objectives. Each innovation must be linked to an existing or proposed launch architecture and operational paradigm.

Focus Area 21 Small Spacecraft Technologies,Z8.01Cubesat Propulsion Systems, GRC," GSFC, JPL, MSFC", TA2 In-Space Propulsion Technologies, 2018,"The CubeSat market shows significant promise to enable low cost science and exploration missions. However, at present many CubeSat technology development activities do not reach flight, and missions that are flown are often selected for concept or component demonstration activities as the primary objectives. Several technology limitations challenge high value science from low-cost CubeSat missions. Limitations include, but are not limited to, post-deployment propulsion capabilities, radiation hardened flight computers, deep space communication, and available instruments. Additionally, propulsion systems often place restrictions on handling, storage, and operations that may limit a CubeSat’s ability to launch as a secondary payload. Nevertheless, opportunities are anticipated in the near future to conduct a larger percentage of CubeSat missions based on application goals and pursue exploration and science return as the primary objectives. Towards that end, this subtopic seeks to develop innovative long-life, reliable, and low-cost electric/chemical propulsion technologies that can enable small satellite science and exploration missions. This year, proposals are specifically sought for complete propulsion system solutions (thrusters, valves, propellant, sensors, electronics, etc.) capable of full scale flight demonstration on 27U, 12U, 6U, or 3U CubeSats in support of deep space and/or swarm topology missions. Proposers should place special emphasis on propulsion system solutions offering long life, reliability, and minimalistic use of CubeSat resources (power, energy, volume, and mass), while delivering propulsion capabilities within the scope of interests described below. Proposals will not be considered that focus purely on features, benefits, and advantages of a new technology, without addressing how their innovative propulsion solution supports improved mission outcome, cost, and productivity. Proposers are expected to show a clear understanding of the current state-of-the-art (SOA) and quantitatively (not qualitatively) describe improvements over relevant SOA technologies that will substantiate the investments in the new technology. Quantification of improvement over the SOA should include any significant advancements that improves the capability of a CubeSat to carry out high-value science missions. For example, advancements are desirable in propulsion system lifetime, reliability, radiation tolerance, cost, energy utilization, miniaturization, thermal management, safety, propellant storage, etc. Potential opportunities for mission infusion for both technology demonstration and long-term mission application should be identified along with potential technology gaps that need to be addressed or assessed. Extensibility of technologies up to 180 kg satellites may be identified, though extensibility beyond 27U CubeSats is not required. Green propellants are a subset of the propulsion technologies of interest. Green considerations may aid in reducing system mass, increase system safety, reduce cost of handling, and reduce integration risks in secondary payloads. Regardless of toxicity or propellant hazards, propulsion systems must show clear consideration for safe containment of the propellant through launch and system operations. These considerations may include the number of inhibits, post-launch pressurization schemes, etc. Proposals are sought that can deliver hardware products and proof-of-concept demonstrations in Phase I. Proposals are sought that can deliver hardware at or greater than TRL 6 suitable for flight demonstration within the Phase II resources provided. Propulsion systems requiring Phase II-E or II-X funding will be considered if justified through mission enabling capabilities. Component level development proposals shall be considered, but must enable important new CubeSat mission capability and identify opportunities for near-term infusion. While component level development shall be considered, preference will be given to complete propulsion system solutions. Specific propulsion capabilities of interest follow below. Metrics are provided either per unit of anticipated spacecraft volume (Usc) or per unit of propulsion system volume (Up). Where one unit of volume is defined as 10 cm cubed. Assume CubeSat wet mass as 2 kg/Usc. Proposers should specify to what S/C size (27U, 12U, 6U, and/or 3U) their propulsion system solution scales to meet or exceed the metrics below. If the propulsion solution can scale to satisfy multiple needs, proposers should quantitatively evaluate their solutions at each applicable scale and concisely present those capabilities in tables or figures. Proposers should also specify at what scale they intend to develop their demonstration hardware. Propulsion systems proposed should conceptually utilize no more than 1/3 the S/C total volume (e.g., propulsion system solutions for a 12U S/C should fit in 4U or less): High impulse propulsion systems meeting the following criteria: Example applications: deep space, interplanetary, orbit capture.

Focus Area 21 Small Spacecraft Technologies,Z8.02Communications for Distributed Small Spacecraft Beyond LEO, GRC," ARC, GSFC, JPL, JSC, LaRC", TA5 Communication and Navigation, 2018,"Space communications and position knowledge and control are enabling capabilities required by spacecraft to conduct all NASA missions. The concept of distributed spacecraft missions (DSM) involves the use of multiple spacecraft to achieve one or more science mission goals. DSM configurations include widely dispersed configurations of spacecraft, constellations, free-flying swarms, formation flying swarms clusters, swarms of common elements, and disaggregated science mission elements, all operating in the space environments beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). The term, “swarm” refers to a configuration of spacecraft that communicate and exchange data and location information with each other andact a one controllable entity. In contrast, ‘constellations’ are loosely grouped spacecraft which may communicate with other but are flown individually. A swarm of dozens to hundreds of spacecraft located 10s to 100s km apart must be able to act as one unit. Small distributed spacecraft acting in cooperation can execute science and exploration missions that would be impossible by traditional large spacecraft, and offer the potential for new concepts in mission design. Innovations in communications and navigation technologies for distributed small spacecraft are essential to fulfill the envisioned science missions within the decadal surveys and contribute to the success of human exploration missions. The goal of this subtopic is to develop DSM-enabling technologies for communications, relative and/or absolute position knowledge, and control of small spacecraft (or other directly related technologies) for configurations of small spacecraft operating over large distances beyond LEO. This subtopic is a direct enabler of deep space distributed spacecraft science missions. DSM Communications Communications among spacecraft in the DSM configuration and between the configuration and the Earth become more challenging beyond LEO distances. Collaborative configurations of widely distributed (10s to 100s km apart) small spacecraft (180 kg or less) will operate far into the near-Earth region of space and beyond into deep space, further stressing the already limited communications capabilities of small spacecraft. The communications links to/from DSM spacecraft beyond LEO distances are closed via either NASA’s near-Earth network (NEN) or deep space network (DSN) ground station infrastructure, depending on the distance of the spacecraft from Earth (i.e., NEN for < 2 million km, DSN for > 2million km). The DSM communications portion of this subtopic invites innovative system level communications architecture and concepts of operation and an integrated communications payload design taking into consideration the following capabilities: DSM configuration control – For distributed operations of the DSM configuration and of individual small spacecraft. Identify alternatives, provide rationale for selection, and develop proposed approaches for: science data time and location stamping; temporary data storage; distributed network control and data planes; networking protocols; and any other considerations associated with control of the configuration. Inter-satellite links (space-space) – For coordinated exchange of science instrument data and spacecraft telemetry and command (T&C) data among small spacecraft in the DSM configuration. Identify alternatives and provide rationale for selection of proposed: frequency band(s) of operation or optical communications; multiple access and addressing techniques; minimum and maximum data rates; expected link bit error rate, maximum expected range between spacecraft, maximum spacecraft field of regard; and pointing stability requirements. Uplinks (Earth-space) and Downlinks (space-Earth) – For coordinated command and control of the DSM configuration and individual small spacecraft from Earth and return of science and telemetry data to Earth. Identify alternatives and provide rationale for selection of proposed: frequency band(s) of operation or optical communications; ground terminal network; coordination with other users of the band(s); multiple access and addressing techniques; minimum and maximum data rates; expected link bit error rate, maximum expected range between spacecraft, ground terminal and maximum spacecraft field of regard; and pointing stability requirements. Integrated communications payload– For the common and unique capabilities of each small spacecraft in the DSM configuration. Identify proposed hardware and software designs of the small spacecraft communications payload(s) required to implement the proposed communications links and operational controls. In addition to the system level concepts of operation and integrated communications payload design, innovations and advancements in technology readiness in one or more of the following constituent small distributed spacecraft technologies is also requested: Small Spacecraft Antennas – Development of antennas optimized for either inter-satellite or uplink/downlink communications are sought across a broad range of technologies including but not limited to deployable parabolic or planar arrays, active electronically steered arrays, novel antenna steering/positioning subsystems, and others suitable for use in high data rate transmission among small spacecraft over large distances. Operations compatible with NASA’s space communications infrastructure [1] and Government exclusive or Government/non-Government shared frequency spectrum allocations is required. [See References for applicable Government frequency spectrum allocations in the near Earth and deep space regions]. Optical Communications – Point-to-point communications are the most common approach for optical communications. This focus area seeks innovations that enable optical communications among many spacecraft simultaneously operating in a distributed spacecraft network. Technologies and integrated solutions for beaconless one-way and/or bidirectional two-way optical communications from beyond LEO to Earth-based optical terminals are also sought. Technology advancements in integrated solutions are sought that increase the data rate or availability of optical communications for small spacecraft, or reduce mission risk, pointing requirements, complexity or cost at a minimally-acceptable Quality of Service. Transceivers and Radios – This area includes but is not limited to: multiple access techniques; radio frequency (RF) transmitters; amplifiers; low noise receivers, full duplex frequency selectable RF front-ends, integrated navigation and communications receivers, software defined or reconfigurable radios, or integrated transceivers and radios for inter-satellite links among distributed spacecraft and/or uplink/downlink via the NEN or DSN. Small satellites are particularly constrained in terms of power, mass and volume, therefore significant improvements in these areas are highly effective. In addition to reductions in mass, power consumption, volume and cost, increases in power and bandwidth efficiency, operational flexibility and frequency select-ability are sought. Small spacecraft transceivers and radios must be compatible with the operations of NASA’s space communications infrastructure. [1] [See References for applicable NASA near Earth and deep space infrastructure guidelines and specifications]. Networking Protocols and Processing – Standard Internet protocols don’t work well over communication links that are subject to the frequent, transient service outages and/or long signal propagation delays that are characteristic of missions beyond LEO. Innovations or advancements are sought in networking protocols and distributed data processing (routing/switching) and storage systems that enable secure, low-power networked communications among small spacecraft within the DSM configuration and/or between the configuration or individual spacecraft and network service users and operators on Earth and/or on the surfaces of other Solar System objects. Implementation of NASA’s delay/disruption tolerant networking (DTN) standards to support scalable, robust and secure mission communications for small spacecraft links from beyond LEO to Earth are also invited. Interoperability between spacecraft operating with NASA and commercial space networks is an additional opportunity for innovation. [See References for applicable NASA and commercial networking standards]. Low mass, power, volume, cost and complexity are overarching goals. Leverage of commercial technologies or best commercial standards and practices (e.g., DVB-S2 standard, CubeSat form factors, 5G wireless technologies) that can demonstrably improve performance and be applied or adapted for use in Government, non-Government or commercial networks is also desirable. Note: Proposed Earth-Space and Earth-Space communications links must be designed to operate in and comply with the frequency spectrum bands implemented by the NEN and/or DSN and/or comply with other frequency spectrum bands allocated by the U.S. National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) tables of frequency allocations for space research. Links among distributed spacecraft must use frequency spectrum allocated by the NTIA in the U.S. for inter-satellite communications service (e.g., ~23 GHz, ~24.5 GHz, ~26 GHz, ~60 GHz). Finally, small spacecraft communication systems operating beyond LEO must be robust, flexible and diverse to support a wide variety of interconnected configurations of spacecraft used by NASA to conduct space science, Earth science and exploration of the universe. Communication system components need to be able to operate over a range of environmental conditions, such as those imposed by launch vehicles and operations in space with appropriate levels of radiation tolerance in the space environment beyond LEO. A clear path to space qualification for potential operation in those regions of space is required of all proposed technologies. DSM Position Knowledge and Control Science measurements of DSMs are based on temporal and spatially distributed measurements where position knowledge and control are fundamental to the science interpretation. Current space navigation technologies are not adequate when relative or absolute position knowledge of multiple spacecraft are involved. Global navigation satellite services like the U.S. global positioning satellites (GPS) provide very limited services beyond GEO distances and no practical services in deep space. Autonomous navigation capabilities are fundamental to DSMs to ensure topography of the configuration is known at the time of data acquisition. Control of the distributed configuration requires robust absolute and relative position knowledge of each spacecraft within the configuration and the ability to control spacecraft position and movement according to mission needs. The navigation portion of this subtopic solicits methods for determining and maintaining spacecraft position within a configuration of small spacecraft. DSM navigation solutions may be addressed via hardware or software solutions, or combinations of the two. Innovations and advancements in technologies for determining relative and absolute position knowledge include but are not limited to: Radiometric measurements - Exploitation of intersatellite communication links allows for measurements via one-, two-, or three-way ranging and/or Doppler shift measurements. Such measurements may allow for accurate estimation of the relative satellite position and velocity vectors in certain DSM topographies. Alternatively, solutions may adapt the proven signal designs of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS, i.e., GPS, GLONASS, Galileo) for the purpose of deep space relative navigation. Novel estimation techniques that are feasible for small satellite processing platforms are also opportunities for innovation. Laser based measurements - Similar to the exploitation of radio communication systems mentioned above, an optical communication system may also provide range and/or range-rate measurements for relative orbit estimation. Innovations that leverage LIDAR technology for relative navigation of small satellites are also invited. Proposals that include satellite design enhancements for improved tracking are sought. Optical navigation - Solutions are sought for visual based systems that leverage advances in optical sensors (i.e., cameras, star trackers) to observe and track a target spacecraft and perform pose and relative position estimation. Opportunities for innovation include methods that do not require the execution of satellite maneuvers are/or the design of external satellite features that enhance observability. Innovations may be appropriate for only certain regimes, such as near, medium, or far range; this context should be described. Solutions for various mission operations concepts are of interest. Other novel navigation methods - Stellar navigation aids, such as navigation via quasars, X-rays and pulsars, may provide enabling capabilities in deep space. Earth-based navigation aids, such as systems detecting radio beacons or terrestrial landmarks, are invited. Methods for autonomous position control are also of interest. Note: Small spacecraft propulsion technologies are not included in this subtopic as those are addressed in subtopic Z8.01, Cubesat Propulsion Systems. Technologies that accomplish autonomous relative orbit control among the spacecraft are invited. Control may be accomplished as part of an integrated system that includes one or more of the measurement techniques described above. Of particular interest are autonomous control solutions that do not require operator commanding for individual spacecraft. That is, control solutions should accept as input swarm-level constraints and parameters, and provide control for individual spacecraft. Opportunities for innovation include the application of optimization techniques that are feasible for small satellite platforms and do not assume particular orbit eccentricities. Phased Development Guidance to Proposers A typical approach to advance the technology readiness level (TRL) leading to future flight hardware/ software demonstration of any of the DSM small spacecraft communications and navigation technologies intended for the beyond LEO environment would include: Phase I - Identify and explore options for the DSM configuration control, conduct trade analysis and simulations, define operating concepts, and provide justification for proposed multiple access techniques, frequency bands of operation, command and data handling and networking solutions. Also identify, evaluate and develop design for integrated communications payload(s) and one or more constituent technologies that enable distributed spacecraft operations in the relevant space environment beyond LEO. Integrated communications system solutions and constituent components offer potential advantages over the state of the art, demonstrate their technical feasibility, and show a path towards a hardware/software infusion into practice. Bench-level or lab-environment level demonstrations or simulations are anticipated deliverables. The Phase I proposal should outline a path that shows how the technology can be developed into space-qualifiable and commercially available small spacecraft communications payloads through Phase II efforts and beyond. Phase II - Emphasis should be placed on developing and demonstrating the candidate integrated communications payload and/or selected technologies under simulated constellations or swarms of small distributed spacecraft in the relevant beyond LEO environment. A demonstration unit for functional and environmental testing is an anticipated deliverable at the completion of the Phase II contract. Some of the products resulting from this subtopic may be included in a future flight opportunity for on-orbit testing or application demonstration. All integrated communications systems and constituent technologies developed under this subtopic area should be compatible with existing NASA space communications infrastructure [1], frequency spectrum allocations, and applicable standards. However, applicability or adaptability to non-Government and commercial use as well is desirable. [1] NASA’s space communications infrastructure includes the Near-Earth network (NEN) of ground stations, the Space Network (SN) of tracking and data relay satellites in geostationary Earth orbit, and the Deep Space Network (DSN) of ground stations.

Low-cost, capable Integrated Circuit (IC) core chipsets are needed that are suitable for use in government and commercial small spacecraft, and other radiation-affected environments. In keeping with the small spacecraft design philosophy and general mission costing profiles, chipsets associated with state-of-the-art IC devices offer a significant potential for improved functionality in space capabilities and cost reduction. However, these devices usually have not been certified for use in the space environment and often have issues with the radiation found in space. As small satellite designers consider mission opportunities beyond low Earth orbit, there is a growing need for IC approaches that provide the functionality found in terrestrial applications and are able to perform their functions over the lifetime of a small satellite mission. Advancing commercial-type functionality to meet these operational needs is desired. There are multiple potential development areas within the suite of spacecraft avionics functions, power systems, and instrument support functions can benefit from taking commercial IC concepts and making them space-ready, specific core chipset capabilities and requirements are not specified in this subtopic. Proposers should consider functions normally found within spacecraft systems (such as avionics, power systems, etc.) and propose solutions to make available for new spacecraft designers. Examples of technology development areas include, but are not limited to: Fault tolerant FPGA/ASIC IP Cores – To enable low cost radiation hardened integrated circuit development, fault tolerant intellectual property cores are sought that can be used to compose fault tolerant System-On-a-Chip (SOC) devices. These SOC devices may be used for spaceflight applications including, command and data handling, embedded power system controllers, embedded motor/actuator controllers, and instrument controllers. IP cores should be AMBA bus compatible, incorporate built-in test, and employ fault tolerance techniques. The IP cores should be sufficiently modular and reusable to allow the implementation of a wide variety of applications. Software Mitigation for Single Event Upset Recovery – Advanced methods to improve Single Event Upset (SEU) recovery in devices that can be demonstrated to comparable or better performance than hardware techniques across several metrics, such as mass and power, and have minimal impact to system speed performance. ASIC Demonstrator - Show how a specific rad hard IC for a defined application can be developed and evaluated by using a low-cost ASIC development approach. In response to this topic, the proposer should: Identify the specific function to be advanced and demonstrate how it is not currently available at the full level performance needed. Identify the intended application environment(s), e.g., GEO, Cis-lunar space, deep space, etc. Explain how the proposed approach exceeds the state of the art in key metrics such as available functionality, power requirements, mass, radiation resistance, temperature range, etc. Identify the technology development necessary to get the proposed IC to the performance needed for the proposed environment and application. The technology development plan needs to include test and verification to include full environmental testing so that the end customer can readily incorporate the chipsets into new vehicles without additional testing. Low-cost chipsets that are used both for space applications as well as terrestrial applications such as DoD, commercial aircraft, etc. are the primary emphasis for this call. General purpose computing processors are explicitly excluded in this call.

Focus Area 21 Small Spacecraft Technologies,Z9.01Small Launch Vehicle Technologies and Demonstrations, AFRC," KSC, LaRC, MSFC", TA1 Launch Propulsion Systems, 2018,"NASA is recognizing a growing demand for dedicated, responsive small spacecraft launch systems and seeks to facilitate the establishment of a robust launch service provider market sector. The movement toward small spacecraft missions is largely driven by rising development/launch costs associated with conventional spacecraft, which poses severe threats to future science/commercial mission cadence, and by rapidly evolving miniaturization innovations that are revolutionizing small spacecraft platform capabilities. This topic seeks innovative technologies, subsystems, and efficient streamlined processes that will support the development of affordable small spacecraft launch systems having a 5-180 kg payload delivery capacity to 350 to 700 km at inclinations between 28 to 98.2 degrees to support both CONUS and sun synchronous operations. Affordability objectives are focused on reducing launch costs to below $1.5M/launch for payloads ranging up to 50 kg or below $30,000/kg for payloads in excess of 50 kg. It is recognized that no single enabling technology is likely to achieve this goal and that a combination of multiple technologies and production practices are likely to be needed. Therefore, it is highly desirable that disparate but complementary technologies formulate and use standardized plug-and-play interfaces to better allow for transition and integration into small spacecraft launch systems. Technology areas of specific interest are as follows: Innovative Propulsion Technologies & Prototype Stages. Affordable Guidance, Navigation & Control. Manufacturing Innovations for Launch Vehicle Structures & Components. Reusability Innovations. Dual Use Hypersonic Flight Testbeds. Proposers are expected to quantify improvements over relevant SOA technologies and substantiate the basis for investment. Potential opportunities for technology demonstration and commercialization should be identified along with associated technology gaps. Ideally, proposed technologies would be matured to TRL 4 to 6 by the end of Phase II effort. Efforts leading to Phase II delivery of integrated prototype stages that could either be ground tested or flight-testing as part of a post-Phase II effort are of particular interest. A brief descriptive summary of desired technical objectives and goals are provided below. Innovative Propulsion Technologies & Prototype Stages Innovative chemical propulsion technologies/subsystem and integrated stage concepts are sought that can serve as the foundational basis of an affordable ground-launch or air-launch system architecture. The scope of interest includes main propulsion systems and novel reaction control systems based on conventional or novel propellants. Technologies or subsystems are expected to demonstrate proof-of-concept by the end of Phase II as a minimum and proposals should include a development roadmap for achieving this goal. Efforts aimed at Phase II delivery of integrated prototype stages that could either be ground tested or flight tested as part of a post Phase II effort are highly encouraged and desired. Technical approaches that address the critical challenges associated with downward scaling of launch vehicles are also highly sought. Solutions that directly address staging sensitivities on deliverable payload mass, for instance, would be of keen interest. Design simplicity, reliability, and reduced development and recurring costs are all important factors. Proposers should explain how their technology works and provide a quantitative assessment of State-of-Art (SOA) in terms of key performance and/or cost metrics. The degree to which the proposed technology or concept is new, different, and important should also be made evident. Affordable Guidance, Navigation, & Control Affordable guidance, navigation & control (GN&C) is a critical enabling capability for achieving small launch vehicle performance and cost goals. Innovative GN&C technologies and concepts are therefore sought to reduce the significant costs associated with avionics hardware, software, sensors, and actuators. The scope of interest includes embedded computing systems, sensors, actuators, algorithms, as well as modeling & design tools. Low cost commercially available components and miniaturized devices that can be repurposed as a basis for low-SWaP GN&C systems are of particular interest. Special needs include sensors that can function during prolonged periods of high-g and high-angular rate (i.e., spin-stabilized) flight, while meeting the stringent launch system environment requirements pertaining to stability and noise. A low-cost GPS receiver capable of maintaining lock, precision, and accuracy during ascent would be broadly beneficial, for example. Sensors that can withstand these conditions might be sourced from industrial and tactical applications, and performance requirements may be achievable by fusing multiple measurements, e.g., inertial and optical (sun, horizon) sensors. Modular actuator systems are also needed that can support de-spin and turn-over maneuvers during ascent. These can include cold-gas or yo-yo type mechanisms. Improved designs are needed to reduce the overall power and volume requirements of these types of actuator systems, while still providing enough physical force to achieve the desired maneuver and enable orbital insertion. Programmable sequencers are required to trigger actuators for events such as stage sequencing, yo-yo and shroud deployment. In addition to hardware, software algorithms for autonomous vehicle control are needed to support in-flight guidance and steering. Robust control laws and health management software are of interest, particularly those that address performance and reliability limitations of affordable hardware. This is especially important in the typical high dynamics (acceleration and angular velocity) conditions of proposed small launch vehicles. Algorithms that are able to merge data from redundant onboard sensors could improve reliability compared to expensive single-string sensors. Similarly, advanced ground-alignment, initialization, and state estimation routines that integrate noisy data are desired to support ascent flight. These algorithms take advantage of improved onboard computational capability in order to process observations from lower accuracy sensors to provide higher fidelity information. Implementations of state-of-the-art Unscented Kalman Filters, and Square-Root-Information Filters with robust noise and sensor models are particularly applicable. Successful technologies should eventually be tested in relevant environments and at relevant flight conditions. Potential testbeds include a variety of spacecraft and aircraft at a variety of scales. Capabilities include reduced gravity, suborbital reusable launch vehicles, high altitude balloons, subscale to ultra-high-altitude aircraft, and inflight simulation. Manufacturing Innovations for Launch Vehicle Structures & Components The development of more efficient vehicle structures and components are sought to improve small launch vehicle affordability. This may include the adoption and utilization of modern lightweight materials, advanced manufacturing inspired design innovations, or systems for actively alleviating launch loads and environments. Approaches for achieving life-cycle cost reductions might also include reduced part count by substitution of multifunctional components; additive and/or combined additive and subtractive manufacturing; repurposing launch structure for post-launch mission needs; incorporating design features that reduce operating costs; adoption of lean best practices for production and manufacturing; and shifting towards commercial practices and/or componentry. Alternatively, approaches based on the utilization of heavier materials could lead to simpler parts, fewer components, and more robust design margins. Although this could yield a larger rocket and impose performance penalties, significantly reduced life-cycle costs could be realized due to overall lower manufacturing and integration cost. Proposers should provide a quantitative assessment of State-of-Art (SOA) in terms of key performance and/or cost metrics. The degree to which the proposed technology or concept is new, different, and important should also be made evident. Reusability Innovations Reusability innovations and subsystem concepts are sought that can serve as the foundational basis of a high flight rate, gas-and-go launch system architecture. Various subsystem technologies are amenable to development and testing via the SBIR program that could then be infused into commercial RLV developments. The scope of interest includes highly reusable propulsion systems that are capable of multiple flights without significant degradation and with minimal inspection/refurbishment requirements. Reusability solutions that directly address vehicle integration, mission profile/transition sensitivities and projected life cycle effects would be of keen interest. This could include quick turnaround ground servicing technologies that enable rapid inspection, maintenance/repair, reloading, and re-flight of stages. Design simplicity, reliability, and reduced development and recurring costs are all important factors. Proposers should explain how their technology works and provide a quantitative assessment of State-of-Art (SOA) in terms of key performance and/or cost metrics. The degree to which the proposed technology or concept is new, different, and important should also be made evident. Dual Use Hypersonic Flight Testbeds The potential repurposing and dual use applications of small launch vehicles as hypersonic flight technology testbeds is of great interest. If low cost small launch vehicle concepts can be dual purposed as affordable hypersonic flight testing platforms with a high degree of commonality, it would open up a highly lucrative sector with significant commercial and defense market potential. The scope of interest is on launch vehicle derived concepts that could boost or gravity turn into a cruise altitude in the range of 75-100 Kft and accelerate a hypersonic testbed stage to a speed of Mach 4 or higher. Because small launch vehicle boosters typically undergo stage-1 to stage-2 separation in the Mach 8-10 range, it is conceivable that these vehicles could serve as low-cost boost phase systems for hypersonic flight testbeds equal in weight to the fully loaded orbital upper stage. Testbed concepts adaptable for a wide range of hypersonic technology investigations, including air breathing propulsion systems and thermal protection systems, while also offering payload recovery and partial testbed stage reusability, are strongly encouraged.

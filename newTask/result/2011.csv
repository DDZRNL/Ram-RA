Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.01Antenna Technology, GRC," GSFC, JPL, JSC, LaRC","NASA seeks advanced antenna systems and technologies to enable communications for future space operations, space science, Earth science and solar system exploration missions. These areas, in priority order, are: Novel Materials for Next Generation Antennas NASA is interested in exploiting novel materials approaches for next generation antennas. For example, ""smart"" materials such as shape memory polymers or ionic polymer metal composites to permit active shape control or beam correction are of interest. Artificial electromagnetic media for phase velocity control and impedance tuning to improve the efficiency and bandwidth of electrically small antennas is of interest. Emerging novel technologies such as ferroelectrics, multiferroics and spintronics concepts leading to new antenna designs are desirable. Smart, Reconfigurable Antennas Smart antennas, reconfigurable in frequency, polarization and radiation pattern, are of interest for space and planetary exploration missions. In particular, antenna designs and proof-of-concepts leading to the reduction of the number of antennas needed to meet the communication requirements associated with rovers, pressurized surface vehicles, habitats, etc., are highly desired. In addition to the aforementioned reconfigurability requirements, specific antenna features include multi-beam operation to support connectivity to different communication nodes on planetary surfaces, or in support of communication links for satellite relays around planetary orbits. Innovative receiver front-ends or technologies that allow for the DSP to move closer to the antenna terminal furthering the impact of the aforementioned, revolutionary ""game-changing"" antenna technology concepts are highly desirable. Ground-based Uplink Antenna Array Designs NASA is considering arrays of ground-based antennas to increase capacity and system flexibility, to reduce reliance on large antennas and high operating costs, and eliminate single point of failure of large antennas. A large number of smaller antennas arrayed together results in a scalable, evolvable system, which enables a flexible schedule and support for more simultaneous missions. A significant challenge is the implementation of an array for transmitting (uplinking), which may or may not use the same antennas that are used for receiving. Arraying concepts that can enable technology standardization across each NASA network (i.e., DSN, NEN, and SN), within the framework of the newly envisioned NASA integrated network architecture, at Ka-band frequencies and above, are highly desired. Phased Array Antennas High performance phased array antennas, i.e., with efficiencies at least 3X that of state-of-practice MMIC-based phased arrays, are needed for high-data rate communication at Ka-Band frequencies and above as well as for remote sensing applications. Communications applications include: planetary exploration, landers, probes, rovers, extravehicular activities (EVA), suborbital vehicles, sounding rockets, balloons, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's), TDRSS communication, and expendable launch vehicles (ELV's). Also of interest are multi-band phased array antennas (e.g., X- and Ka-band) and RF/optical shared aperture dual use antennas, which can dynamically reconfigure active elements in order to operate in either band as required to maximize flexibility, efficiency and minimize the mass of hardware delivered to space. Phased array antennas for space-based range applications to accommodate dynamic maneuvers are also of interest. The arrays are required to be aerodynamic or conformal in shape for sounding rockets, UAV's, and expendable platforms and must be able to withstand the launch environment. Potential remote sensing applications include: radiometers, passive radar interferometer platforms, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) platforms for planetary science. Large Aperture Deployable Antennas Large aperture deployable antennas with surface root-mean-square (rms) quality better than λ/40 at Ka-Band frequencies and above, are desired. In addition, these antennas should significantly reduce stowage volume (packaging efficiencies as high as 50:1), provide high deployment reliability, and significantly reduced mass density (i.e., 2). These large Gossamer-like antennas are required to provide high-capacity communication links with low fabrication costs from deep space (Mars and beyond). Concepts addressing antenna adaptive beam correction with pointing control are also of interest. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase I Deliverables: Research to identify and evaluate candidate telecommunications technology applications to demonstrate the technical feasibility and show a path towards a hardware/software demonstration. Bench or lab-level demonstrations are desirable. Phase II Deliverables: Emphasis should be placed on developing and demonstrating the technology under simulated flight conditions. The proposal shall outline a path showing how the technology could be developed into space-worthy systems. The contract should deliver a demonstration unit for functional and environmental testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Read less>>"
Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.02Reconfigurable/Reprogrammable Communication Systems, GRC," AFRC, ARC, GSFC, JPL, JSC","NASA seeks novel approaches in reconfigurable, reprogrammable communication systems to enable the vision of space, exploration, science, and aeronautical flight systems. Advancements are required in communication systems to manage the demands of the harsh space environment on space electronics, maintain flexibility and adaptability to changing needs and requirements, and provide flexibility and survivability due to increased mission durations. NASA missions can have vastly different transceiver requirements ranging from 1's to 10's Mbps at UHF & S frequency bands while X & Ka frequency bands require 10's to 1000's of Mbps. Available mission resources also vary greatly depending on the science objective, operating environment, and spacecraft resources. For example, deep space missions are often power constrained; operating over large distances, and subsequently have lower data transmission rates when compared to near-Earth or near planetary satellites. These requirements and resource limitations are known prior to launch, which can be used to maximize transceiver efficiency while minimizing resources consumed. Larger platforms such as vehicles or relay spacecraft may provide more resources but may also be expected to perform more complex functions or support multiple and simultaneous communication links to a diverse set of assets. This solicitation seeks advancements in reconfigurable transceiver and associated component technology with a goal of providing flexible, reconfigurable communications capability while minimizing on-board resources and cost. Technological domains of interest include the development of software defined radios or radio subsystems which demonstrate reconfigurability, flexibility, reduced power consumption of digital signal processing systems, increased performance and bandwidth, reduced software qualification cost, and error detection and mitigation technologies. Complex reconfigurable systems will provide multiple channel and multiple and simultaneous waveforms. Within these domains of interest, desired proposal focus areas to develop and/or demonstrate technologies are as follows:Software/firmware for the management of waveform and/or functional reconfiguration during simultaneous radio operation while adhering to the Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) is desired.

Novel approaches to mitigate device susceptibility to radiation effects.STRS Architecture documentation is available at the following link: (http://spaceflightsystems.grc.nasa.gov/SpaceOps/CoNNeCT/). The above URL also provides an overview of the Communications, Navigation, and Networking reConfigurable Testbed (CoNNeCT) flight program. The reconfigurable radios developed for this system represent the state-of-the-art in technology for space flight communication systems and may be used as a reference for the focus areas above. See also subtopic O1.06 - CoNNeCT Experiments for additional information. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.03Game Changing Technologies, GRC," ARC, JSC","NASA seeks revolutionary, highly innovative, game changing communications technologies that have the potential to enable order of magnitude performance improvements for space operations, exploration systems, and/or science mission applications. Research is geared towards far-term research focused in (but not limited to) the following areas:Develop novel techniques for size, weight, and power (SWAP) of communications sys-tems by addressing digital processing and logic implementation tradeoffs, dynamic power management, hardware and software partitioning. Address high-speed, high resolution, low power consumption, and radiation tolerance (e.g., SiGe) to support near Earth and deep space mission environments. Investigate and demonstrate novel technologies to alleviate the demanding requirements (3- to- 5X improvement in sampling rate/resolution over state-of-the-art) on analog to digital converters (ADCs) and digital signal processors (DSPs). Develop technologies to evolve NASA communication networking and radio capabilities to autonomously sense and adapt to their environment, detect and repair problems and learn as they operate. Nodes will be dynamically aware of state and configuration of other nodes and adapt accordingly. Communications and navigation subsystems on future missions will interpret their situation on their own, understand their options, and select the best means to communicate or navigate. High-performance, multifunctional, nano-structured materials are of interest for applications in human spaceflight and exploration. These materials (notably single wall carbon nanotubes) exhibit extraordinary mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties at the nanoscale and possess exceptionally high surface area. The development of nano-scale communication devices and systems including nano-antennas, nano-transceivers, etc. are of interest for nano-spacecraft applications. Quantum entanglement, quantum key distribution or innovative breakthroughs in quantum information physics. Address proposed revolutionary improvements in communicating data, information or knowledge. Methods or techniques that demonstrate extremely novel means of effectively packaging, storing, encrypting, and/or transferring information are sought. Significant development is needed in high flux single photon sources and entangled pair sources for highly efficient, free space communications. Small spacecraft, due to their limited surface area, are typically power constrained, limiting small spacecraft communications systems to low-bandwidth architectures. Technologies and architectures, which can exploit commercial or other terrestrial communication infrastructures to enable novel smallsat missions to enable a wider variety of space missions are desired. Address how existing communications architectures can be adapted and utilized to provide routine, low cost, high bandwidth communications capabilities for spacecraft to ground, and spacecraft to spacecraft applications. Ultra wide-band (UWB) technology is sought to support robotic localization of surface assets. Whether two-way ranging (time -of-flight) or time-difference of arrival, the ability to synchronize the receivers determine the localization accuracy. Efficient Media Access Control (MAC) and networking protocols are paramount to ensure power efficiency and scalability. Integrating communications and positioning in an ad hoc network can indeed enable situational awareness, keeping track of location and relative position to other astronauts, robots, and vehicles at any time through visual and/or audio cues. Because initial synchronization or signal acquisition for Impulse Radio Ultra-Wide Band (IR-UWB) using equivalent-time sampling takes a long time especially for low pulse repetition rate systems, precise timing and coherent reception demand more power consumption and complexity than non-coherent IR-UWB. To maintain clock stability, most IR-UWB systems do not power down the receivers during operation. Narrower pulse width spreads the RF energy over a wider bandwidth but generation of precise low jitter ( Develop methods for use of neutrinos for communications, timing, and ranging. Neutrinos are small, near light speed particles with no electric charge. Since neutrinos travel through most matter, they could be used for extreme long-distance signaling. Detection of neutrinos currently require massive underground liquid detectors. Highly innovative concepts, methods, techniques to enable neutrino based communication, ranging, timing, are sought.For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase I Deliverables: Deliverables expected at the end of Phase I include trade studies, conceptual designs, simulations, analyses, reports, etc. at TRL 1-2. Phase II Deliverables: Demonstrate performance of technique or product through simulations and models, hardware or software prototypes.

Space Operations,Topic O2 Space Transportation ,O2.02Propulsion Technologies, GRC," AFRC, ARC, MSFC","Current launch to orbit vehicles, both expendable and reusable, require months of preparation for flight. Although there are available (in-production) practical propulsion options for such a vehicle, the costs for outfitting the booster stage are in the hundreds of millions of dollars. If reusable, additional months are required to verify all components and systems before re-flight. These costs severely limit what missions NASA can perform. The propulsion systems are a major focus during this time, yet aircraft engines are checked and certified for re-flight in less than an hour. While rocket engines actually have many similarities to aircraft engines, there are several factors that drive the complexity and therefore the cost of rocket engines. These include toxic propellants that require special protections for personnel and the environment, cryogenic propellants that require complex tank fill operations and costly specialized ground support equipment, high combustion chamber temperatures for increased performance and thrust, and high combustion chamber pressures for increased performance and reduced engine size and weight. To move more toward low cost access to space, the above barriers to low-cost propulsion systems must be addressed and overcome. Of primary focus are non-toxic propellant combinations that provide adequate performance without requiring excessive specialized handling equipment and procedures, and engines that provide reliable and adequate performance without needing to push the far limits of temperature and pressure environments. Component technologies that move toward these top-level goals that are of interest include:Ablative materials and manufacturing techniques that increase capability while reducing production time and cost.

Increased performance margin (e.g., operating temperature % of material limit, operating stress % of component limit, etc.).These are critical technology improvements that are required in the next 3 - 8 years. Projects are required to demonstrate the component or technology to a TRL level of 5 - 6 in order to allow for infusion into low-cost earth-to-orbit propulsion systems.

The ability for launch vehicles to combine the significant weight savings of composite tanks and composite overwrap pressure vessels (COPVs) with airline like operations could be possible if these tanks are reusable, reliable, and need little to no maintenance between flights. Composite and composite overwrap tanks offer significant weight savings, however, there are significant shortfalls in terms of reusability, especially when using cryogenic fluids. This lack of reusability severely hampers adoption of this enabling technology in future reusable vehicle designs. This subtopic seeks to mature such emerging technologies pertaining to high performance, light-weight tanks and pressure vessels suitable for cryogenic and non-cryogenic temperatures at high pressures; seeks to develop technologies that extend life and/or decrease cost while being mindful of permeability, damage tolerance, safe-life and checkout issues; and seek out seal and joint development, increasing tank robustness and life while not increasing weight or cost; all against the current state-of-the-art capabilities and technologies. Areas of interest to develop and/or demonstrate are as follows:Material Development: New composite material development specifically for cryogenic use demonstrating cycling, reparability, and knowledge of permeability and damage tolerance. Data should clearly show materials and processes used in producing a vessel that performs well under long-term use in a cryogenic condition. Vessel performance and cycling should be analyzed at and during operational conditions (i.e., cryogenic conditions) to verify material integrity. The vessel would minimize micro cracking, should be damage tolerant and repairable, and have mounting capabilities. Permeability of the material should be addressed and evaluated against current material usage and limitations. Reusability and Reliability: Reusable, reliable, and low cost tanks that need little to no maintenance between flights and minimal check-out are required for economic and operational sustainability. These innovative propellant tank (either cryogenic or non-cryogenic) developments can: Ease operability of the tank diagnostics. Enable tank prognostics. Enable tanks to handle high pressure cycles and loads without leaking or developing structural failure. Promote ease of manufacture by more than one American company. Promote ease of repair without returning tanks to the manufacturer's facility. Promote rapid certification/recertification techniques to meet expected FAA commercial RLV requirements. Data and Technology Development: Of specific concern and interest are safe-life and damage tolerance testing. There is much scrutiny regarding the manner and degree of testing in these areas, specifically after some number of pressure cycles. Also of concern is the effect of temperature during cycling and on material integrity. Due to the limited amount of flight and long term performance data there is little to base future design on when the desire is heritage similarity. Thus, development in regards to these specific metrics (safe-life and damage tolerance testing) would be most beneficial to both short and long term missions.For the proposed technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware demonstration and testing. Delivery of a demonstration unit for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract is also required. Phase I Deliverables: Desired deliverables at the end of Phase I should be at TRL 3-4. Final report containing:Optimal design and feasibility of concept. Detailed path towards Phase II demonstration. Detailed results of Phase I analysis, modeling, prototyping and development testing . Material coupon data and a prototype sub-scale tank.Phase II Deliverables: Deliverables expected at the end of Phase II should be at TRL 5-6. By the end of Phase II, working proof-of-concept technologies, including features and demonstration of long term, high cycle performance at cryogenic temperatures, demonstrated and delivered to NASA for testing and verification.

Space Operations,Topic O2 Space Transportation ,O2.05Advanced Propulsion Testing Technologies, SSC, JSC,"The aim of this subtopic is to develop new technologies to reduce cost and schedule, improve reliability and quality, and increase safety of Rocket Propulsion Testing. To this end, proposals for technology development will be accepted for any of the following four subject areas:Critical Vacuum Sensing. Helium Recovery. Robust Components. Advanced Propulsion Test Data Management. Critical Vacuum Sensing Technology Develop new innovative methods for remotely and automatically locating and quantifying vacuum leaks in large vacuum chambers subject to harsh environmental conditions. A new test stand, A3, is being built at SSC to test rocket engines at altitude conditions. Information on A3 Test Stand can be found at the following URLs: http://sscfreedom.ssc.nasa.gov/etd/ETDTestFacilitiesA3.asp. http://www.tulane.edu/~sse/FORUM_2010/pdfs/e1.pdf(link is external). http://www.nasa.gov/centers/stennis/pdf/436170main_A-3%20Test%20Stand%20FS-2010-03-00093.pdf.To simulate altitude during rocket engine testing, A3 test stand produces a vacuum of 0.15psia inside a large, 40 ft diameter, rocket engine test chamber using 27 chemical steam generators and a 2-stage diffuser/ejector system. If vacuum leaks occur, the desired simulated altitude may not be achievable thus any leaks must be located and repaired. However, personnel access to the vacuum test chamber during operation is restricted due to the hazardous nature of its operation. This makes locating vacuum leaks difficult, if not impossible. Therefore, automated remote detection and location of areas of air in-leakage is required. Due to the unique nature of this test facility, innovation in these technologies is necessary. Performance metrics include accuracy and sensitivity in detecting leaks in the harsh operational environment with high levels of noise and vibration while not producing false leak indications, as well as robust design for the harsh environment. Helium Recovery Technology Helium is a rare and nonrenewable resource with many properties critical to the commercial, military, and fundamental scientific research sectors. NASA consumes approximately 1 million pounds of helium each year, primarily for purging of cryogenic propellant systems in which the helium is discharged to atmosphere and lost. The goal of this subtopic thrust area is to develop innovative helium recovery technologies that economically dissociate helium from large volumes of mixtures of helium, air, and hydrogen purge discharge, and pressurize the reclaimed helium for storage and reuse. The total cost of recovering and reusing helium, from both capital and energy expenditure, should be less than procuring the same amount of helium from traditional sources. Also, particular emphasis is placed on portability (i.e., not a fixed installation) and speed of separation (near-real-time) that accommodates a single system servicing numerous distinct sources of helium, air, and hydrogen mixtures developed over the range of rocket propulsion testing and ground and flight operations and the temporal transient nature of production of these mixtures. Robust Component Technologies Rocket propulsion test hardware as well as ground and flight launch operations hardware regularly experience large and rapid changes in pressures, temperatures, vibration, and fluid flow rates while demanding high precision control and reliability. Typical ranges in these parameters are pressures from vacuum all the way up to 10,000 psi, working fluids at ambient temperature all the way down to -420F, vibration environments in the 100's of G RMS acceleration. These parameters can span their entire range in milliseconds. State of the art propulsion system testing hardware has evolved over time as better materials and experience in hardware interactions with these environments have progressed. Innovation in component performance diagnostics technology is required to continue the current progression in hardware operational reliability, cost, and weight optimization. Accordingly, the goal of this subtopic thrust area is to develop innovative in situ hardware performance measurement and diagnostics technology along with the accompanying data acquisition and management systems required for utilization the new technologies. Advanced Propulsion Test Data Management Capability Substantial advances in data capture and storage technologies have exponentially increased real and near-real time data availability in rocket propulsion testing. Effective utilization of this increase in data availability requires evolution of data management technologies, methods, and concepts that will enable greater and more effective real-time access, manipulation, and application in the control and quality of propulsion systems testing. Recent initiatives in development of hardware-in-the-loop technologies, merging measured and simulation data in real time feedback with propulsion test hardware have demonstrated the feasibility and utility of this technology. The goal of this subtopic thrust area is to develop innovative ways to take advantage of increased propulsion test data availability utilizing high performance hardware such as GPU based computer systems along with innovation in algorithms and software to implement new data management technologies, methods, and concepts. In these subject areas, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward hardware and/or software development as appropriate, which occurs during Phase II and culminates in a proof-of-concept system. Phase I Deliverables: A final report describing optimal design for the technology concept including feasibility, trade studies, detailed results of Phase I analysis, modeling, prototyping, and testing as applicable. The report should also contain a detailed path towards Phase II hardware and/or software proof-of-concept system. The technology concept at the end of Phase I should be at a TRL of 3-4. Phase II Deliverables: A working proof-of-concept system successfully demonstrated in a relevant environment and delivered to NASA for testing and verification. The technology at the end of Phase II should be at a TRL of 6-7. Read less>>"
Space Operations,Topic O3 Processing and Operations ,O3.01Remotely Operated Mobile Sensing Technologies for inside ISS, ARC, JPL,"This subtopic seeks proposals to develop technologies that advance capabilities for space telepresence and mission operations situation awareness, fault diagnosis, isolation, and recovery onboard the ISS using an onboard free-flyer as a mobile sensor platform. In order to increase productivity and reduce risks on long-missions on spacecraft, such as the ISS, leading toward human exploration, commercialization, and colonization of space, ground personnel have a need to remotely command a wide-variety of sensors on mobile platforms to collect data from a variety of positions within spacecraft. The sensors include, but are not limited to, those capable of performing imaging, identifying inventory, and measuring electromagnetic radiation, temperature, acoustics, atmospheric properties, and chemical concentrations. To increase crew productivity, it is highly desirable that the mobile platform be capable of being deployed by ground command, move to the commanded location, collect data, and then return to its storage dock where it is recharged all without requiring crew assistance. This subtopic solicitation calls for developing a variety of software and hardware technologies that would enable a free-flyer to operate in multiple modules inside ISS including but not limited to:Free-flyer localization capability without engineering environment. Collision avoidance capability. Adjustable autonomous control software that supports safe operation with low-bandwidth, intermittent command communication loop with varying latencies > 10 sec. EXPRESS rack-based auto-docking, recharging, refueling, deployment mechanism with matching free-flyer mechanism. Quiet propulsion capability meeting ISS noise limit requirements ( Vision-based object identification capability. RFID-based inventory identification capability.Proposals may address any one or a combination of the above or related subjects. Three SPHERES satellites have operated inside ISS since 2006. In addition to performing dozens of experiments, these satellites demonstrate that mobile platforms in the form of free-flyers can be operated on ISS. However, these satellites have not been operated by ground personnel and their current design is inadequate to meet the needs described above for several reasons, e.g., the satellites require crew assistance to operate, require that batteries and CO2 cartridges (propellant) be replaced by crew between test sessions, and are confined to a work area bounded by external beacons used by the satellites to localize themselves within their workspace, approximately 2x2x2 meters. However, the SPHERES satellites may be useful in demonstrating technologies called for by this subtopic. Proposals are encouraged that leverage the SPHERES satellites operating onboard ISS and SPHERES engineering units at the NASA Ames Research Center. More information on SPHERES is at: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/SPHERES.html. http://ssl.mit.edu/spheres(link is external).For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.

Space Operations,Topic O3 Processing and Operations ,O3.02ISS Utilization, JSC," ARC, GRC, KSC","NASA is investigating the near- and mid-term development of highly-desirable systems and technologies that provide innovative ways either to leverage existing ISS facilities for new scientific payloads or, to provide on orbit analysis to enhance capabilities and reduce sample return requirements. Current utilization of the ISS is limited by available upmass, downmass, and crew time as well as by the capabilities of the interfaces and hardware already developed. Innovative interfaces between existing hardware and systems, which are common to ground research, could facilitate both increased, and faster, payload development. Desired capabilities include, but are not limited to, the below examples:Enabling additional cell and molecular biology culture techniques. Providing innovative hardware to allow for safe, contained transfer of cells from container to container within the Microgravity Sciences Glove Box (MSG) would permit new types of studies on ISS. On orbit analysis techniques that would reduce or remove the need for downmass - such as a system for gene array tests, or kits for DNA extractions for long term storage - are also examples of hardware possibilities that would extend and enable additional research. Providing compact Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) hardware. Development of a compact robust DLS instrument based on diode lasers and photo detectors capable of providing significant power and weight savings now make it possible to measure the diffusion coefficient of experimental systems using the Light Microscopy Module (LMM) on the International Space Station (ISS). The light scattering instrument (laser, detector, optics) to be mounted on a Leica DM/RXA microscope camera port should be about the size of a 40mm diameter tube around 60mm long) with associated support electronics (including the correlator) being able to fit into a volume of about 30mm x 100mm x 100mm, or less. The intensity dynamic range should be able to cover between 10^-10 to 10^-7 Watts. The relaxation time range should be capable to spanning 200nsec to 50sec. This peer-reviewed science was considered a decade ago but not developed due to technology limitations. It is now possible to meet the required performance criteria (with the above size and power requirements) to measure diffusion coefficients. From the measured diffusion coefficient, particle size can be extracted, or the temperature determined for the location being viewed (e.g., in a capillary cell with a temperature gradient along it) can be deduced (for known particles and solvents) using the Stokes-Einstein equation. Providing compact laser tweezers and supporting software. Development of a compact robust Holographic Laser Tweezers (LT) instrument and associated control scripts for use with a microscope on the International Space Station (ISS) based on the recent developments of holographic techniques. This could expand the types of experiments conducted on orbit. The laser tweezers that would mount on a Leica DM/RXA microscope should be less than ~100mm on a side and the associated control electronics should be less than ~150mm on a side. This technology should now be robust side it is solid-state and no longer requires gimbaled mirrors. This peer-reviewed science was previously considered but not developed because of the size and technology limitations of a decade ago. LT holds open the possibility of performing scientific experiments that manipulate groups of particles that evolve uniquely in space when gravitational sedimentation and jamming no longer exist. Any new LT and its corresponding control software should allow for tracking of particle positions to better than one micron in 3D (before the concentration becomes too high) and impart rotational forces. Being able to accurately track the position of particles while measuring the forces on them is important for laying the foundations of colloidal engineering. Because of its use on space station, the instrument should be self-calibrating. The instrument would need to meet the size and volume limitations of the Light Microscopy Module (LMM). Providing additional on-orbit analytical tools. Providing flight qualified hardware that is similar to commonly used tools in biological and material science laboratories could allow for an increased capacity of on-orbit analysis thereby reducing the number of samples, which must be returned to Earth. Examples of tools that will reduce downmass or expand on-orbit analysis include: sample handling tools; mass measurement devices; a (micro) plate reader; a mass spectrometer; an atomic force microscope (for biological and material science samples), non-cryogenic sample preservation systems; autonomous in-situ bioanalytical technologies; centrifuges for analysis and for providing fractional-g environments; microbial and cell detection and identification systems; and fluidics and microfluidics systems to allow autonomous on-orbit experimentation and high throughput screening. Providing Nanorack compatible inserts to enable additional life science payloads. Development of 1, 2 and/or 4 cube design biological payload hardware for use with the ISS Nanorack platform would decrease the need for development of multiple control racks and reduce development time of future payload experiments. Enabling additional payloads. Innovative methods for further subdividing payloads lockers would allow for numerous pico-payloads. Developing multi-generational or multi-use habitats would reduce the upmass and downmass required to conduct biological experiments on ISS.The existing hardware suite and interfaces available on ISS may be found at: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments_category.html. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase I Deliverables: Written report detailing evidence of demonstrated technology (TRL 5 or 6) in the laboratory or in a relevant environment and stating the future path toward hardware and software demonstration on orbit.

Space Operations,Topic O3 Processing and Operations ,O3.04Vehicle Integration and Ground Processing, KSC, SSC,"This subtopic seeks to create new and innovative technology solutions to improve safety and lower the life cycle costs of assembly, test, integration and processing of the ground and flight assets at our nation's spaceports and propulsion test facilities. The following areas are of particular interest: Control of Material Degradation Technologies are needed to reduce costs due to material degradation of materials in spaceport and propulsion test facility infrastructure and ground support equipment, Material solutions must meet current and emerging environmental restrictions and endure today's corrosive and highly acidic launch environments. These needs include:New environmentally friendly technologies for paint removal and surface preparation that can be applied to large structures. New technologies must achieve better performance than conventional abrasive blasting techniques by reducing the cost of collecting and/or processing waste while keeping blasting rates the same or better than conventional technologies. These technologies must work for inorganic zinc coating. New environmentally friendly technologies for prevention/reduction of microbial corrosion in steel piping systems utilizing brackish or untreated water. Sub-scale or laboratory tests that can be used to evaluate the suitability of refractory concrete for use in launch pad and rocket test facilities flame deflectors. Proposed tests must show that they are relevant to full scale blast effects. Innovative refractory material application methods to ensure field applications have the same properties (strength, density, performance, etc...) as small scale test coupons. Spaceport Processing Evaluation/Inspection Tools Innovative solutions are desired that reduce inspection times, provide higher confidence in system reliability, increase safety and lower life cycle costs. Technologies must support identifying composite material defects, evaluating material integrity, damage inspection and/or acceptance testing of composite systems. These include:Technologies in support of defect detection in composite materials. Methods for determining structural integrity of composite materials and bonded assemblies. Non-intrusive inspection of Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPV), Orion heat shield and other composite systems. In-situ evaluation of refractory concrete as installed in the flame trenches associated with propulsion test and launch pad infrastructure. Hypergolic Propellant Sensing Technologies Technologies for leak detection and leak visualization for hypergolic propellants, such as:Novel, cost effective technology solutions to provide leak detection of hypergolic propellants at concentrations of 10ppb with minimal environmental sensitivity (i.e., humidity). Sensors and leak detection systems should provide quantitative data with minimum interferences, drift, and exposure and recovery time. Novel, cost effective technology solutions to provide leak detection of hypergolic propellants at concentrations of 1ppm with minimal environmental sensitivity (i.e., humidity). Sensors and leak detection systems should provide quantitative data with minimum interferences, drift, and exposure and recovery time. Technology to provide leak visualization of hypergolic propellants to support operations (propellant loading, pressurization, leak check). Cold Gas Storage and Servicing of Launch Vehicle Systems Storing high-pressure pneumatic gases in a chilled state increases the on board density of gasses used for pressurization during flight. Traditional solutions embed these 3000 - 6000 psig metallic tanks into the flight vehicles' main cryogenic propellant tanks. To achieve the lightest weight tanks, final pressurization takes place after the tanks are immersed to maximize strength gained by the lower temperatures. Under these conditions, it takes several hours to achieve thermal equilibrium with the host tank and maximize mass density of the compressed gas. Solutions are sought to reduce this time to less than 60 minutes to achieve thermal equilibrium of the compressed gas with the host liquid cryogen tank and maximize pneumatic gas mass on board the flight vehicle. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware or software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.

Space Operations,Topic O3 Processing and Operations ,O3.05Advanced Motion Imaging, MSFC, JSC,"Digital motion imaging technologies provide great improvements over analog systems, but also present significant challenges. Digital High Definition Television (HDTV) cameras flown on the Shuttle and International Space Station have shown higher susceptibility to ionizing radiation damage, manifested by visible ""dead"" pixels in the image. In order to practically deploy HDTV cameras, sensors and processors need to survive operations on orbit for years without debilitating radiation damage that degrades image quality and performance. The focus of this subtopic is the development of components, systems, and core technologies that advance the capabilities to capture, process and distribute high-resolution digital motion imagery without performance degradation from ionizing radiation that would require frequent upmass to orbit to replace components or systems. Current State of the Art HDTV cameras flown on the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station have proven to be highly susceptible to damage from ionizing radiation. This damage is manifested by bad pixels that eventually render the camera useless after short periods of on-orbit use, usually less than one year. In addition, upmass and downmass constraints make the use of large format motion picture film cameras impractical, so a digital equivalent is needed for large venue documentary film productions, such as IMAX films. Domains of Interest Domains of interest in the near term address needs for space environment, radiation tolerant, HDTV and digital cinema cameras and down-stream video processors. Mid and Long term goals include radiation tolerant, reprogrammable, highly bandwidth efficient encoders and improved distribution systems for video data signals. Current HDTV transmissions from the ISS require approximately 25 Mbps. Bitrates with equal or better video quality are desired at half that bit rate. These systems are highly desired by the human spaceflight programs. Technologies of Interest Technologies are sought that provide high resolution, progressively scanned motion imagery with limited or mitigated radiation damage to sensors, are viable for astronaut hand-held applications or external spacecraft use, and that provide imagery that meets standards commonly used by digital television or digital cinema production facilities. Commercial HDTV cameras used for internal hand-held use have generally been small and light (5"" x 6"" x 11"", between 2 and 3 pounds), run off rechargeable batteries, and utilize standard lens mounts. Future cameras for exterior applications ideally would be smaller and more modular in design (no larger than 4"" x 5"" x 7"" and 2.5 pounds). The critical technology need is the radiation tolerance of the sensor, not the size, weight and mass of the camera that results from such a sensor. While commercial HDTV and Digital Cinema cameras for use on Earth are mature technologies, there are no flight-proven radiation tolerant HDTV and Digital Cinema cameras and sensors currently available. Commercial cameras flown on the Shuttle and ISS thus far do function, but degrade within a year on orbit. While hard to classify, the current TRL for these cameras within the context of spaceflight operations could be considered to be a 5 or 6. The ultimate goal is to develop radiation-hardened camera sensors capable of surviving three or more years in space. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration, and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase I Deliverables: Deliverables for Phase I will include designs and development plans with plausible data and rationale that demonstrates why the designs and plans should mitigate radiation effects on the sensors, and a detailed path towards Phase II hardware demonstration. The report shall also provide options for commercialization opportunities after Phase II. Phase II Deliverables: Deliverables for Phase II will include developmental hardware suitable for testing in a lab or space flight environment (TRL 6) as well as a test plan, relevant data, and defined expected lifespan of the sensors.

Space Operations,Topic O3 Processing and Operations ,O3.06Environmental Control Systems & Technologies for NR & Cubesats, ARC, JSC,"A significant challenge faced by free-flying spacecraft and shared by ISS-bound experiment packages is the requirement for a controlled (or at least known) environment while the payload is awaiting launch on the launch vehicle or is in transit to the ISS. Due to the retirement of the Space Shuttle, NASA has a need for flight qualified, environmentally conditioned transportation systems compatible with new space launch systems capable of sustaining and extending the life of perishable materials and specimens until experiment packages can be installed and properly interfaced on-board ISS. This solicitation seeks to develop innovative environmental control technologies for the ground and space transportation of nanorack cubes and cubesats. Cubesat integration timelines frequently call for passively mating to the launch vehicle or deployer system many weeks in advance of launch. The environment that the payload experiences plays a major role on the shelf life of certain materials and specimens within the spacecraft. Technologies capable of monitoring and extending the shelf life of perishable payloads are of interest to NASA as the environment in and around the launch vehicle is not always controlled in a manner favorable to a payload. Technologies can be either integrated directly into the Cubesat or external to the Cubesat. Two applications for these technologies are sought:ISS Nanorack Transportation System. This system will have the ability to maintain temperatures within relevant ranges for biological and/or perishable Nanorack payloads from time of experiment preparation at the payload processing facility until installation into the host facility on ISS. This also includes ground transportation phases of the mission. The Transportation System will also provide a time history of relevant parameters ie temperature, relative humidity, vibration, etc, during the transportation periods up to payload installation on ISS. Cubesat applications. Cubesat applications involve technologies that may be incorporated into the Cubesat spacecraft itself, or systems that can be used as adjuncts to monitor and control the environment in and around the Cubesat payload/spacecraft. These technologies can be passive and/or active in nature. Cubesat applications will also provide a time history of relevant parameters ie temperature, relative humidity, etc during the dwell time on the pad while awaiting launch.Innovative approaches to this problem will significantly increase the utility of Nanoracks modules and/or Cubesat spacecraft in that this technology will enable an expanded set of experiment types and mission scenarios. Such a capability may also be extended in support of ground control experiments where on-orbit environments must be duplicated in the lab.

Advancements in MEMs-based rate sensors and accelerometers, algorithm techniques and Kalman filtering, high bandwidth and low noise outputs, phased-based attitude determination, single aperture systems, quick Time to First Fix and reacquisition. Robust tracking during separation. Use of GPS and Ability to Mitigate Interference Signals Innovative technologies to increase the accuracy of the L1 C/A navigation solution by combining the pseudo ranges and phases of the L1 C/A signals, and use of the L2 and L5 carriers. Factors that degrade the GPS signals can be obtained by differencing the available carrier phase and pseudo range measurements and then removing these differences from the navigation solution. Technologies are sought that combine spatial processing of signals from multiple antennas with temporal processing techniques to mitigate interference signals (jamming) received by the GPS receiver. The coordinated response of adaptive pattern control (beam and null steering) and digital excision of certain interfering signal components can minimize strong jamming signals. Adaptive nulling minimizes interfering signals by the optimal control of the GPS antenna pattern (null steering).

Blackjack: http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/2000/blackjackgps.html.NASA is not interested in funding efforts that seek to ""re-invent the wheel"" by duplicating the many investments that NASA and others have already made in establishing the current state-of-the-art. We seek to maximize the work listed above in the new work sought for this subtopic. General Operational Needs, Requirements and Performance Metrics: Onboard Near-Earth Navigation Systems NASA seeks proposals that would develop a commercially viable transceiver with embedded orbit determination software to provide enhanced accuracy and integrity for autonomous onboard GPS- and TDRSS-based navigation and time-transfer in near-Earth space via augmentation messages broadcast by the proposed TDRSS Augmentation for Satellites Signal (TASS; http://www.gdgps.net/system-desc/papers/Bar-Sever.pdf(link is external)). Innovations that will increase the integration, reducing the size, weight, and power of such transceiver platforms, and improving their performance in high radiation environments, are sought. Proposers are advised that NASA's GEONS and GIPSY orbit determination software packages already support the capability to ingest TASS messages. Onboard Deep-Space Navigation Systems NASA seeks proposals to develop an onboard autonomous navigation and time-transfer system for reduction of DSN tracking requirements. Such a system should provide accuracy comparable to delta differenced one-way ranging (DDOR) solutions anywhere in the inner solar system, and exceed DDOR solution accuracy beyond the orbit of Jupiter. Proposers are advised that NASA's GEONS and AutoNav navigation software packages already support the capability to ingest many one way forward Doppler, optical sensor observation, and accelerometer data types. In addition, NASA is seeking innovative solutions in the area of planetary surface navigation. Technologies Supporting Improved TDRSS-Based Navigation NASA seeks proposals providing improvements in TDRS orbit knowledge, TDRSS radiometric tracking, ground-based orbit determination, and Ground Terminal improvements that improve navigation accuracy for TDRS users. Methods for improving TDRS orbit knowledge should exploit the possible future availability of accelerometer data collected onboard future TDRS. The goal is navigation and communications integrated into a single processor. Navigation Payload Technology for Planetary Relay Satellites NASA seeks planetary relay navigation payload technologies that can:Transmit accurate spread spectrum signals (emphasizing the stability of the frequency reference yielding accurate timing and chipping rate of the PN code and a low noise carrier). Receive same in return (either in coherent mode (the relay transmits and receives using the same frequency reference) or non-coherent mode (where the accurate frequency reference is on one end of link, either the transmit side or the receive side)).This relay navigation payload should be capable of receiving a satellite-to-satellite link with similar signal properties. The relay navigation payload has to measure the range (two-way), pseudo-range (one-way), and both one-way and two-way Doppler. The relay navigation payload must be able to de-commutate data received from Earth and bases on other planetary surfaces to maintain time synchronization with a master time source, use the data onboard to either slave its frequency reference or to update its reference, and turn-around the data to modulate onto the user data stream. Additionally, the relay navigation payload must have:'Reasonable fidelity' autonomous filtered navigation capability to fuse all data types listed above as well as antenna gimbal angles, accelerometer data, and rendezvous radar data, to estimate the lunar relay state. Output data rates of 1 Hz for the states of multiple satellites and comprehensive fault detection and correction data. State outputs that can be modulated on transmitted data streams. TASS-like broadcast beacon capability for navigation. The data on the beacon can originate either at a base location (earth, moon), the relay, or another asset with which the relay communicates. Dissemination of time and navigation data for the local environment.Proposals can either address a single subject as described above or a combination of subjects. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I (to reach TRL 3) and show a path toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract (to reach TRL 5).

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.01Aviation External Hazard Sensor Technologies, LaRC, ARC,"NASA is concerned with new and innovative methods for detection, identification, evaluation, and monitoring of in-flight hazards to aviation. NASA seeks to foster research and development that leads to innovative new technologies and methods, or significant improvements in existing technologies, for in-flight hazard avoidance and mitigation. Technologies may take the form of tools, models, techniques, procedures, substantiated guidelines, prototypes, and devices. A key objective of the NASA Aviation Safety Program is to support the research of technology, systems, and methods that will facilitate transformation of the National Airspace System to Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) (information available at www.jpdo.gov(link is external)). The general approach to the development of airborne sensors for NextGen is to encourage the development of multi-use, adaptable, and effective sensors that will have a strong benefit to safety. The greatest impact will result from improved sensing capability in the terminal area, where higher density and more reliable operations are required for NextGen. Under this subtopic, proposals are invited that explore new and improved sensors and sensor systems for the detection and monitoring of hazards to aircraft before they are encountered. The scope of this subtopic does not include human factors and development of human interfaces, including displays and alerts, except where explicitly requested in association with special topics. Primary emphasis is on airborne applications, but in some cases the development of ground-based sensor technology may be supported. Approaches that use multiple sensors in combination to improve hazard detection and quantification of hazard levels are also of interest. At this time, there are some areas of particular interest to NASA, and these are described below. They are provided as encouragement but not intended to exclude other proposals that fit this subtopic. These areas of interest include two specific hazards to aircraft and specific advancements in fundamental radar technology. The interest in radar technology can be considered to be independent of the interest in the two hazards. While NASA is interested in all aviation hazards, wake vortices and turbulence are of particular interest. Proposals associated with remote sensing investigations addressing these hazards are encouraged. This emphasis is not intended to discourage proposals targeting other or additional hazards such as reduced visibility, terrain, airborne obstacles, volcanic ash, convective weather, lightning, gust fronts, cross winds, and wind shear. Airborne detection of wake vortices is considered challenging due to the fact that detection must be possible in nearly all weather conditions, in order to be practical, and because of the size and nature of the phenomena. Proposals are encouraged for the development of novel coherent and direct detection lidar systems and associated components that allow accurate meteorological wind and aerosol measurements suitable for wake vortex characterization. Lidar development includes, but is not limited to, novel transceiver architectures, efficient signal processing methodologies, wake processing algorithms and real time data reduction and display schemes. Improvements in size, weight, range, system efficiency, sensitivity, and reliability based on emerging technologies are desired. NASA has made a major investment in the development of new and enhanced technologies to enable detection of turbulence to improve aviation safety. Progress has been made in efforts to quantify hazard levels from convectively induced turbulence events and to make these quantitative assessments available to civil and commercial aviation. NASA is interested in expanding these prior efforts to take advantage of the newly developing turbulence monitoring technologies, particularly those focused on clear air turbulence (CAT). NASA welcomes proposals that explore the methods, algorithms and quantitative assessment of turbulence for the purpose of increasing aviation safety and augmenting currently available data in support of NextGen operations. In order to detect and/or discriminate some meteorological hazards, future radars will need multi-frequency and/or polarimetric capabilities. NASA seeks new system/component designs and hazard detection applications for airborne weather radars based upon extending the current design to incorporate multi-frequencies and/or polarimetric capabilities. In addition, the current generation of weather radar is fundamentally limited by its ability to scan the airspace; consequently, NASA is seeking novel designs and enhancements to produce electronically scanned antennas/radars.Read less>>"
Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.02Inflight Icing Hazard Mitigation Technology, GRC, ARC,"NASA is concerned with the prevention of encounters with hazardous in-flight conditions and the mitigation of their effects when they do occur. Under this subtopic, proposals are invited that explore new and dramatically improved technologies related to inflight airframe and engine icing hazards for manned and unmanned vehicles. Technologies of interest should address the detection, measurement, and/or the mitigation of the hazards of flight into supercooled liquid water clouds and flight into regions of high ice crystal density. With these emphases in mind, products and technologies that can be made affordable and capable of retrofit into the current aviation system and aircraft, as well as for use in the future are sought. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:Non-destructive digitization of ice accretions on wind tunnel wing models. NASA has a need for methods to digitize ice shapes with rough external surfaces and internal voids as can occur with accretions on highly swept wing. Current methods based upon scanning with line-of-sight optical digitization methods have been found inadequate for these ice shapes. New instruments are needed utilizing innovative concepts to measure ice-crystal/liquid water mixed phase clouds in ground test facilities and in flight. Cloud properties of interest include: crystal/droplet temperature, material phase, particle size, speed, cloud liquid-water content, ice-water content, air temperature, and humidity. Non-intrusive measurement techniques capable of providing the spatial distribution of these properties across an engine duct with a diameter of at least 3 feet are particularly of interest. New instruments or measurement techniques are also needed for the detailed study of the ice accretion process on wing surfaces and internal engine components. Properties of particular interest are heat transfer, accretion extent, and ice density. The measurement of these properties needs to be non-interfering. Read less>>"
Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.03Durable Propulsion Components, GRC, ARC,"The mitigation and management of aging and durability-related hazards in future civilian and military aircraft will require advanced materials, concepts, and techniques. NASA is engaged in the research of materials (metals, ceramics, and composites) and characterization/validation test techniques to mitigate aging and durability issues and to enable advanced material suitability and concepts. Proposals are sought for the development of physics-based probabilistic fatigue life models for powder metallurgy disk superalloys, which include both crystal plasticity and surface environmental damage modes. The models would capture the evolution of fatigue damage due to crystallographic slip within multiple grains of variable orientation and size, as well as damage due to environmental interactions at the surfaces of compressor and turbine powder metallurgy superalloy disks. This research opportunity is focused on quantifying, modeling and validating each of these damage modes during simple cyclic and dwell fatigue cycles, and then later for simulated service in aerospace gas turbine engine disk materials. Work may involve use of uniform gage and notched fatigue specimens to simulate key disk features, potentially utilizing varied disk surface finish conditions and associated residual stress and cold work. The simulated load history and temperature gas turbine engine conditions should approximate turbine service history reflective of the new generation of gas turbine engines and include the effect of superimposed dwell cycles. NASA will be an active participant in Phase I of the research effort by providing superalloy disk sections, for the proposer to machine into specimens, mechanically test, analyze, and model evolution of these damage modes. Technology innovations may take the form of the unique quantification of the effect of service history on these damage modes, and include analytical modeling descriptions of the evolution of these parameters as a function of simulated service history. The technology innovations may also include models and algorithms extrapolating this damage to service conditions outside of those tested during the program. Read less>>"
Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.04Airframe Design and Sustainment, LaRC," AFRC, GRC","Conventional aircraft airframe structures have achieved a high level of reliability through decades of experience, incremental technology changes, and an empirically based building block design methodology. Emerging and next generation aircraft will employ new lightweight materials and structural concepts that have very different characteristics than our current experience base. One element in NASA's effort to ensure the integrity of future vehicles is research to improve the reliability of airframe structures through enhanced computational methods to predict structural integrity and life, and validating correlation between computational models and the as-manufactured and as-maintained aircraft structure. NASA seeks tools and methods for improved understanding and prediction of structural response, and experimental methods for measuring and evaluating the performance of new airframe structural designs. Specific areas of interest include the following:Improved structural analysis methods for complex metallic and composite airframe components using novel multi-scale as well as global-local computational codes. The methods used for these solutions need to detail the initiation and progression of damage to determine accurate estimates of residual life and or strength of complex airframe structures. Robust numerical algorithms are required to simulate the nonlinear behavior of damage progression coupled with geometric and material nonlinearity. Correlation between computational models and airframe structures: Experimental methods for detailed characterization of as-manufactured structures relative to the as-designed configuration, to identify deviations in geometry, material application, and possibly identify manufacturing anomalies. Advanced experimental methods for full-field assessment of strain during structural or flight tests for the purpose of validating computational models, and identifying hot-spots in the structure that are not represented in the models. Ease of application on built-up structures will be a significant factor. Technologies to measure residual stresses in structures resulting from manufacturing processes and fit-up during structural assembly, as these residual stresses may severely compromise design margins. Repair technology for metallic or composite structures: Novel approaches to arrest damage and return structural integrity (other than replacement, grind out, scarf, or bonded or bolted doublers). Validation of structural repair: technology to interrogate an applied repair to validate the design of the repair, and correct application of the repair. The intent will be to determine whether the repair performs as expected to return structural integrity.Technology innovations may take the form of tools, models, algorithms, and devices.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.05Sensing and Diagnostic Capabilities for Degradation in Aircraft Materials and Structures, LaRC," AFRC, ARC, GRC","Many conventional nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and integrated vehicle health management (IVHM) techniques have been used for flaw detection, but have shown little potential for much broader application. One element in NASA's effort to ensure the integrity of future vehicles is research to identify changes in fundamental material properties as indicators of material aging-related hazards before they become critical. For example, composites can exhibit a number of micromechanisms such as fiber buckling and breakage, matrix cracking and delaminations as precursor to failure. For complex metallic components an inability to determine residual stress state limits the validity of predictions of the fatigue life of the component. To further these goals, NDE and IVHM technologies are being sought for the nondestructive characterization of age-related degradation in complex materials and structures. Innovative and novel approaches to using NDE technologies to measure properties related to manufacturing defects, flaws, and material aging. Measurement techniques, models, and analysis methods related to quantifying material thermal properties, elastic properties, density, microcrack formation, fiber buckling and breakage, etc. in complex composite material systems, adhesively bonded/built-up and/or polymer-matrix composite sandwich structures are of particular interest. Other NDE and IVHM technologies being sought are those that enable the quantitative assessment of the strength of an adhesive region of bonded joints and repairs or enable the rapid inspection of large area structures. The anticipated outcome of successful proposals would be both a Phase II prototype technology for the use of the developed technique and a demonstration of the technology showing its ability to measure a relevant material property or structural damage in the advanced materials and structures in subsonic aircraft.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.06Propulsion Health State Assessment and Management, GRC, AFRC,"The emphasis for this subtopic is on propulsion system health management, in order to predict, prevent, or accommodate safety-significant malfunctions and damage. Past advances in this area have helped improve the reliability and safety of aircraft propulsion systems; however, propulsion system component failures are still a contributing factor in numerous aircraft accidents and incidents. Advances in technology are sought which help to further reduce the occurrence of and/or mitigate the effects of safety-significant propulsion system malfunctions and damage. Specifically the following are sought: propulsion health management technologies such as instrumentation, sensors, health monitoring algorithms, and fault accommodating logic, which will detect, diagnose, prevent, assess, and allow recovery from propulsion system malfunctions, degradation, or damage.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.07Avionics Health State Assessment and Management, ARC, LaRC,"Shielded twisted-pair cables are already in common use on-board aircraft and spacecraft, and are destined to be ubiquitous in the all-electric aircraft designs of the future. At present, however, easy to use commercially available connector interfaces between this type of cable and electrical test equipment (such as oscilloscopes, network analyzers, or handheld diagnostic units) are not readily available, and custom-built test fixtures are the norm. Given the widespread use of this cable type in other commercial wiring applications such as DSL, NASA is investing in the research and development of a commercial-grade product to address this need. Proposals are therefore sought for the design of a novel electrical connector system (or small portable interface board) that can interface the coaxial SMA (or 2.9 mm) ports of typical high-end electrical test equipment with a shielded twisted-pair (STP) cable (2 inner conductors surrounded by a shield). The design should provide two 50 ohm coaxial SMA (or 2.9 mm) inputs, each used to individually excite the common and differential modes of the cable, and one output connection to the STP cable itself. In addition, the design should minimize the mode cross coupling caused by the connector in the frequency range of interest (0-10 GHz). Finally, a critical part of the design must include a calibration method and set of calibration standards for obtaining a high-quality Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) based measurement (using a standard VNA) of the 4 port 4x4 S-parameter matrix covering the differential and common mode ports on each end of the TSP cable from 0-10 GHz. Proposals should address the design and the numerical verification of the connector and calibration standards in Phase I, with the experimental validation and the prototype construction reserved for Phase II. Use of a commercial electromagnetics simulator such as COMSOL is strongly encouraged. While the design does not need to be compact or inexpensive at this stage, any obvious impediments to its subsequent miniaturization or commercialization will be considered a serious weakness.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.08Crew Systems Technologies for Improved Aviation Safety, LaRC, LaRC,"The NASA Aviation Safety program aims to model and develop integrated crew-system interaction (ICSI) concepts and to subsequently evaluate this concept in a relevant operational environment in comparison to state-of-the-art. NASA seeks proposals for novel technologies and evaluation tools with high potential to support an ICSI with effective crew-system interactions in the context of NextGen operational requirements (e.g., 4D trajectory-based operations, visual operations in non-visual meteorological conditions, etc.) and assumptions (e.g., net-centric information management environment) (NextGen described in http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/(link is external)). To improve these interactions, we seek interventions that proactively identify and mitigate NextGen flight deck risks; address documented crew-related causal factors in accidents; and improve the ability to unobtrusively, effectively, and sensitively evaluate and model crew and crew-automation system performance. In particular, we seek proposals for the development of advanced technologies that address:Crew challenges associated with piloting terminal area 4D Trajectory-Based Operations in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). Displays, decision-support, and automation interaction under off-nominal conditions; in particular in that lead to spatial disorientation and loss of energy state awareness leading to loss-of-control (LOC). The appropriate levels of integrity for new classes of information to be made available to the crew as a result of NextGen's net centric information management environment. Pilot proficiency in increasingly automated flight decks (e.g., manual handing skill erosion). Optimal methods for information presentation as distributed over time and display space for multiple operators to maximize crew information processing and coordination. Appropriate trust in, and therefore use of, automation and complex information sources by, for example, conveying constraints on automation reliability and information certainty/timeliness. Effective joint cognitive system design and evaluation with multiple intelligent agents (human and automated, proximal and remote).

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.09Integrated Vehicle Dynamics Modeling Methods for LOC Conditions, LaRC," ARC, GRC","Effective characterization of LOC conditions requires inclusion of the flight dynamics effects from multiple disciplines, including aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, and aeroelasticity. However, the types of data and data sets obtained from modeling in these various disciplines can be quite disparate, even within a discipline (e.g., wind-tunnel static versus dynamic data versus CFD flow-field data), and is exacerbated when we consider the non-linear parts of the flight envelope. Further, disciplines have varying levels of sensitivity to certain flight conditions. Of interest are software tools that could take such disparate types of information and provide methods to manage and integrate them in a single environment to provide flight-dynamics-relevant implications. Examples include translating thrust response into force and moment increments to superimpose on the nominal aerodynamics, or applying aerodynamic load distributions to key structural components to define flight envelope boundaries based on structural load limits. Such tools can also be useful in highlighting flight conditions where data sets overlap and thus may provide good integrated model fidelity, versus conditions where fidelity may be limited, helping provide guidance on where research emphasis should be placed. Overall, concepts should be aimed at facilitating integrated model implementation into a flight simulation environment. Read less>>"
Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.10Advanced Dynamic Testing Capability for Abnormal Flight Conditions, LaRC," ARC, GRC","The goal of developing a comprehensive methodology for obtaining appropriate aerodynamic math models for flight vehicles over a greatly expanded flight envelope requires a more general formulation of the aerodynamic model that more accurately characterizes nonlinear steady and unsteady aerodynamics. This leads to greater demands in the development of dynamic test techniques and correspondingly more demands on test facility capabilities. This topic is for the design and software for a prototype dynamic test rig for wind or water tunnel application, with guidance for scaling up to large facilities. The concept should be aimed at providing high-automation and productivity for arbitrary, programmable, multi-axis motions, and should consider the following test capabilities that are considered an important subset of possible motions for characterizing vehicle dynamics characteristics under abnormal flight conditions: conventional single-axis forced oscillation; constant-rate motion through the use of square and triangle waveforms; steady and oscillatory coning motions; inclined axis coning; coupled, multi-axis motion; and wide-band inputs, such as Schroeder sweeps.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.11Transport Aircraft Simulator Motion Fidelity For Abnormal Flight Conditions, LaRC," AFRC, ARC, GRC","Piloted simulation remains an important enabling tool for a wide variety of research aimed at commercial aviation safety. Over the past decade, significant advances in aerodynamic modeling of large transport airplanes at high angles of attack are providing new capabilities for prediction of flight behavior in off-nominal or out-of-envelope conditions. As a result, piloted simulation is now being considered for flight training specifically aimed at stall and post-stall conditions. In addition, other technology areas focused on the problem of loss-of-control accidents, such as advanced controls and crew systems, now stand to benefit from this enhanced simulation capability. Simulator motion often plays an important role in simulator fidelity. For example, hexapod motion systems are commonly used for airline flight training and are justified by the increased transfer of training with the added realism of cockpit accelerations. However, it is recognized that all motion systems have limitations and therefore maneuvers must be designed to stay within the limits of the system's capabilities and range of effectiveness. The problem of aircraft upsets and loss-of-control typically involves large-amplitude motions due to extended excursions in vehicle attitudes and angular rates, and the desire to emulate the resulting accelerations has added a new challenge to simulator motion fidelity. A response to this need has been proposals for new motion systems that provide sustained cockpit accelerations that are possible during upset events. Over the past decade, limited research has been conducted on the effects of motion on upset training (both ground-based and in-flight simulation) and one approach has involved analysis of pilot performance with various types of training. This subtopic requests a broad study of the requirements and capabilities for simulator motion systems across the range of current and proposed systems, including fixed-base, hexapod, continuous-g and in-flight simulation. It is intended that this research be aimed at large-amplitude motions and address simulation facility requirements for research and training or other uses for a broad range of applications and technologies. In addition, proposals for new or enhanced motion cueing systems are encouraged if justified by this study. Desired outcomes of this research include but are not limited to the following:Analysis of motion system requirements and cueing algorithms for large-amplitude maneuvers, including out-of-envelope or loss-of-control events for large transport airplanes. A comparison of maneuver envelopes for current and proposed simulator motion devices. Analysis of the state-of-the-art of motion systems that includes anticipated new requirements. Physiological considerations for transfer of fidelity and realism of cockpit motion environments. Benefits of various motion capabilities based on physiological factors, transfer of training, and other criteria as appropriate. Integration of aerodynamic buffet effects and other cockpit noise and vibration sources.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.12Propulsion System Performance Prediction for Integrated Flight and Propulsion Control, GRC, LaRC,"In current aircraft, the flight and propulsion controls are designed independently and pilots manually integrate them through manipulation of the cockpit controls. Although the pilot manages these individual systems well under normal conditions, an integrated design approach would be able to achieve maximum benefit from these systems under abnormal conditions, especially for energy management and coordinated control for upset prevention and recovery. NextGen operations might also benefit, especially relative to 4-D trajectory management. If properly integrated up front in the flight control design, the propulsion system could be an effective flight control actuator. However, in order to optimally integrate the two systems, the engine performance must be known. The propulsion performance is dependent on operating condition, and many safety constraints make it highly nonlinear. Thus it is necessary to have a system that can continuously predict the engine performance and constraints at the current operating condition and communicate this to the flight control system to facilitate optimal flight and propulsion integration. Ideally, the flight control system should be able to treat the propulsion system as a linear time-varying constrained system for real-time control purposes. Including the propulsion system in the flight control design provides another degree of freedom for the designer, and because the propulsion system is such a powerful actuator, it is one that potentially enhances upset prevention and recovery. Developing the ability to use the propulsion system to augment the flight control while still providing traditional pilot interaction with the cockpit controls can improve maneuverability and safety transparently. Under this research subtopic, an approach to predicting, and communicating engine dynamic response that facilitates integrated flight and propulsion control would be developed. This is a prerequisite to utilizing the engines as flight control actuators to improve maneuverability and aid in upset prevention and recovery.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.13Advanced Upset Protection System, AFRC," ARC, GRC, LaRC","One of the common causes for Loss of control (LOC) is the crew's lack of awareness of the current energy state relative to the current mission phase and inappropriate response to a low or high-energy state. Technologies to prevent the development of an inappropriate energy state via manual aids and automatic approaches are crucial for the prevention of loss of control. In large airplanes, energy management refers to the ability to know and control the complex combination of the aircraft's airspeed and speed trend, altitude and vertical speed, configuration, and thrust. For example, near-terminal operations (takeoff and landing) require precise control of airspeed to achieve optimum performance while maintaining safe stall margin, and altitude management is critical for approaches. The penalty for improper energy management can be de-stabilized approaches, excessive pilot workload leading to distraction, and ultimately inadequate altitude or airspeed to recover from a loss-of-control event (e.g., stall). Many loss-of-control incidents/accidents can be attributed to improper management of airspeed, especially those leading to aerodynamic stall or departure from controlled flight. Under this research subtopic, an envelope protection system would be developed to prevent low and high energy states based on the aircraft's current mission phase objectives. The envelope protection system should investigate the automatic use of the propulsion system, landing gear and secondary flight controls to maintain energy state. Methods to display information on system status to the pilot should also be considered to prevent adverse pilot interaction with the envelope protection system. Use on both current and NextGen aircraft should also be considered. Read less>>"
Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,"A1.14Detection, Identification, and Mitigation of Sensor Failures", LaRC," AFRC, ARC","Faults related to aircraft sensing systems have been a major cause of loss-of-control accidents and incidents. For example, an airspeed sensing system fault is suspected of setting into motion a chain of events that resulted in the loss of Air France flight 447 (June 2009); a faulty altimeter is suspected in the stall and crash of Turkish Airline flight 1951 (February 2009); and faulty angle-of-attack sensing is suspected of causing violent uncommanded motion in Qantas Flight 72 (October 2008). Sensor redundancy is essential to ensure safety and reliability of the flight systems; however, redundancy alone may not be sufficient to avoid problems due to common mode failures across redundant sensors (such as suspected Pitot tube icing in all airspeed sensors). Therefore, research is needed to utilize all information available from multiple- possibly diverse- sensors in order to rapidly detect and isolate sensor faults in real time. The research would involve information fusion across multiple sensors, detection of erroneous behavior within a sensor or sensor suite, and mitigation of information loss through algorithmic redundancy and design to estimate the lost information from a failed sensor.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.15Unmanned Vehicle Design for Loss-of-Control Flight Research, LaRC, AFRC,"Recent advances in unmanned vehicle systems have enabled subscale flight testing using remotely piloted or autonomous vehicles to obtain high fidelity estimates of key aircraft performance parameters. An important requirement for obtaining relevant dynamic flight data from subscale vehicles is to apply dynamic scaling to the aircraft, so as to provide scaled inertial and mass properties, as well as geometric similitude. The use of these vehicles is of particular interest in aviation safety studies because they allow exploration into unusual flight attitudes and upset conditions that are difficult to test in full scale aircraft due to structural limits and other safety concerns. Models of the stall and departure characteristics, as can be identified through flight testing, are needed to improve both aircraft training simulators as well as allow the design of control systems to reduce loss-of-control accidents. Proposals are sought for a subscale civil transport vehicle design for remotely operated flight testing that allows a wide range of vehicle configurations. The vehicle should be modular in construction to emulate configurations representative of both conventional tail jet transports with under-wing engines and T-tail transports with rear mounted engines. In addition, the design should allow ballasting to achieve a range of target inertias and center of gravity locations. The ability to introduce flexible components for aeroelastic effects, as well components to model structural and control surface failures are also of interest. Proposals should address construction methods that allow tradeoffs in costs and complexity while maintaining structural integrity required for loss-of-control flight testing. Control surfaces should be distributed to provide redundancy and allow for experiments involving actuator failures and in-flight dynamic simulation. Vehicle size should be consistent with commercially available turbine engines and allow road transport with manual field assembly. Read less>>"
Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.16Validation Methods for Safety-Critical Systems Operating under LOC Conditions, LaRC," AFRC, ARC, GRC","Validation of future complex integrated systems designed to ensure flight safety under off-nominal conditions associated with aircraft loss of control is a significant challenge. Future systems will ensure vehicle flight safety by integrating vehicle health management functions, resilient control functions, flight safety assessment and prediction functions, and crew interface and variable autonomy functions. Each of these functions is characterized by algorithmic diversity that must be addressed in the validation process. Vehicle health management involves diagnostic and prognostic algorithms that utilize stochastic decision-based reasoning and extensive information processing and data fusion. Resilient control functions can involve adaptive control algorithms that utilize time-varying parameters and/or hybrid system switching. Flight safety management may involve diagnostic and prognostic reasoning algorithms as well as control theoretic algorithms. Crew interface functions involve displays that are human-factors-based and require information processing and reasoning, and variable autonomy will require assessment and reasoning algorithms. Onboard modeling functions will involve system identification algorithms and databases. Normal operating conditions of the future may extend beyond current-day operational limits. Moreover, safe operation under off-nominal conditions that could lead to loss-of-control events will be a focus of the system design. In particular, operation under abnormal flight conditions, external hazards and disturbances, adverse onboard conditions, and key combinations of these conditions will be a major part of the operational complexity required for future safety-critical systems. Future air transportation systems must also be considered under operational complexity, such as requirements for dense all-weather operations, self separation of aircraft, and mixed capabilities of aircraft operating in the same airspace, including current and future vehicle configurations as well as piloted and autonomous vehicles. System validation is a confirmation that the algorithms are performing the intended function under all possible operating conditions. The validation process must be capable of identifying potentially problematic regions of operation (and their boundaries) and exposing system limitations - particularly for operation under off-nominal and hazardous conditions related to loss of control. New methods, metrics, and software tools must be established for algorithms that cannot be thoroughly evaluated using existing methods. Innovative research proposals are sought to address any of the following areas:Analytical Validation Methods. Predictive Capability Assessment Methods. Real-Time (or Run-Time) Validation Methods.Analytical validation methods are comprised of a set of analytical methods and tools that facilitate the accurate prediction of system properties under various operating and off-nominal conditions. A wide variety of analytical methods will be needed to evaluate stability and performance of various and dissimilar system functions, robustness to adverse and abnormal conditions, and reliability under errors, faults, failures, and damage. These methods and software tools will be utilized offline and prior to implementation in representative avionics system software and hardware. These methods will enable analysis under a wide range of conditions, and be used to facilitate nonlinear simulation-based and experimental evaluations under selected potentially problematic conditions in order to expose system deficiencies and limitations over a very large operational space. Analytical methods and tools applicable to determining stability, performance, robustness, and reliability of nonlinear, time-varying, and/or hybrid systems involving control theoretic, diagnostic/prognostic, and/or reasoning systems are sought. Predictive capability assessment is an evaluation of the validity and level of confidence that can be placed in the validation process and results under nominal and off-nominal conditions (and their associated boundaries). The need for this evaluation arises from the inability to fully evaluate these technologies under actual loss-of-control conditions. A detailed disclosure is required of model, simulation, and emulation validity for the off-nominal conditions being considered in the validation, interactions that have been neglected, assumptions that have been made, and uncertainties associated with the models and data. Cross-correlations should be utilized between analytical, simulation and ground test, and flight test results in order to corroborate the results and promote efficiency in covering the very large space of operational and off-nominal conditions being evaluated. The level of confidence in the validation process and results must be established for subsystem technologies as well as the fully integrated system. This includes an evaluation of error propagation effects across subsystems, and an evaluation of integrated system effectiveness in mitigating off-nominal conditions and preventing cascading errors, faults, and failures across subsystems. Metrics for performing this evaluation are also needed. Uncertainty-based and/or statistical-based methods and tools that enable the determination of level of confidence in the validation of uncertain systems operating under extreme conditions are sought. Real-time (or run-time) validation methods are needed for the onboard monitoring of crucial system properties whose violation could compromise safety of flight. These properties might include closed-loop stability, robustness margins, or underlying theoretical assumptions that must not be violated. This information could be used as part of a real-time safety-of-flight assessment system for the vehicle. Real-time methods and software tools are sought that enable onboard validation of nonlinear, time-varying, and reasoning systems. Read less>>"
Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.17Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, ARC," AFRC, ARC, GRC","The fulfillment of the SSAT project's goal requires the ability to transform the vast amount of data produced by the aircraft and associated systems and people into actionable knowledge that will aid in detection, causal analysis, and prediction at levels ranging from the aircraft-level, to the fleet-level, and ultimately to the level of the national airspace. The vastness of this data means that data mining methods must be efficient and scalable so that they can return results quickly. Additionally, much of this data will be distributed among multiple systems. Data mining methods that can operate on the distributed data directly are critical because centralizing large volumes of data is typically impractical. However, these methods must be provably able to return the same results as what a comparable method would return if the data could be centralized because this is a critical part of verifying and validating these algorithms, which is important for aviation safety applications. Additionally, algorithms that can learn in an online fashion---can learn from new data in incremental fashion without having to re-learn from the old data---will be important to allow deployed algorithms to update themselves as the national airspace evolves. The data is also heterogeneous: it consists of text data (e.g., aviation safety reports), discrete sequences (e.g., pilot switches, phases of flight), continuous time-series data (e.g., flight-recorded data), radar track data, and others. Data mining methods that can operate on such diverse data are needed because no one data source is likely to be sufficient for anomaly detection, causal analysis, and prediction. This topic will yield efficient and scalable data-driven algorithms for anomaly detection, causal analysis, and prediction that are able to operate at levels ranging from the aircraft level to the fleet level. To that end, the methods must be able to efficiently learn from vast historical time-series datasets (at least 10 TB) that are heterogeneous (contain continuous, discrete, and/or text data). Distributed data-driven algorithms that provably return the same results as a comparable method that requires data to be centralized are also of great interest. Online algorithms that can update their models in incremental fashion are also of great interest for this subtopic. Read less>>"

Vehicles for subsonic and supersonic flight regimes will be required to emit extremely low amounts of gaseous and particulate emissions to satisfy increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Hypersonic vehicles require combustion systems capable of sustaining stable and efficient combustion in very high speed flow fields where fuel/air mixing must be accomplished very rapidly and residence times for combustion are extremely limited; a major challenge is developing scaling laws that will allow the size of scramjet engines to be increased by a factor of 10, i.e., to mass flow rates of 100 lbm/sec.

In turn, high confidence prediction enables high confidence development and assessment of innovative aerodynamic concepts. This subtopic seeks innovative physics-based models and novel aerodynamic concepts, with an emphasis on flow control, applicable in part or over the entire speed regime from subsonic through hypersonic flight. All vehicle classes will experience subsonic flight conditions. The most fundamental issue is the prediction of flow separation onset and progression on smooth, curved surfaces, and the control of separation. Supersonic and hyper-sonic vehicles will experience supersonic flight conditions. Fundamental to this flight regime is the sonic boom, which to date has been a barrier issue for a viable civil vehicle. Addressing boom alone is not a sufficient mission enabler however, as low drag is a prerequisite for an economically viable vehicle, whether only passing through the supersonic regime, or cruising there. Atmospheric entry vehicles and space access vehicles will experience hyper-sonic flight conditions. Reentry capsules and vehicles deploy multiple parachutes during descent and landing. Predicting the physics of unsteady flows in supersonic and subsonic speeds is important for the design of these deceleration systems.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics ,A2.06Aerothermodynamics, ARC," AFRC, GRC, LaRC","Development of hypersonic flight vehicles for airbreathing access to space and for planetary entry poses several design challenges. One of the primary obstacles is the large uncertainty in predictive capability of the aerothermal environment to which these vehicles are subjected. For airbreathing access to space vehicles, predictions of boundary layer transition to turbulence and shock boundary layer interactions in a turbulent flow regime are sources of large aerothermal uncertainty and require conservative assumptions. For planetary entry vehicles with either rigid or flexible thermal protection systems (TPS), sources of large aerothermal uncertainty in high enthalpy conditions also include the catalytic or ablative properties of the TPS. The fluid dynamic and thermochemical interactions of a rough ablating surface with the aerothermal environment leads to many poorly understood coupled phenomena such as early boundary layer transition, turbulent heating augmentation, catalytic heating, radiation absorption, etc. At high entry speeds and large vehicle sizes, shock layer radiation becomes a large component of the aeroheating, with an increasing fraction of the radiation produced in the poorly understood vacuum ultraviolet part of the spectrum. The low confidence in the predictive capability is apparent in high enthalpy flows that are often difficult to adequately reproduce in a ground test facility. The model uncertainties require designers to resort to large margins, resulting in reduced mission capabilities and increased costs. Future science and human exploration missions to Mars and other planets will require dramatic improvements in our current capability to land large payloads safely on these worlds. Research in aerothermodynamics focuses on solving some of the most difficult challenges in hypersonic flight. These include the development of predictive models via experimental validation for shock layer radiation phenomena, non-equilibrium thermodynamic and transport properties, catalycity, transition and turbulence, and ablation phenomena, as well as the development of new experimental datasets, especially in high enthalpy flow that can be used to validate theoretical and computational models.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics ,A2.07Flight and Propulsion Control and Dynamics, ARC," AFRC, GRC, LaRC","NASA is conducting fundamental aeronautic research to develop innovative ideas that can lead to next generation aircraft design concepts with improved aerodynamic efficiency, lower emissions, less fuel burn, and reduced noise and carbon footprints. To realize these potential benefits, innovative vehicle design concepts can exhibit many complex modes of interactions due to many different effects of flight physics such as aerodynamics, vehicle dynamics, propulsion, structural dynamics, and external environment in all three flight regimes. Advanced flight control strategies for innovative aircraft design concepts are seen as an enabling technology that can harvest potential benefits derived from these complex modes of interaction. The following technology areas are of particular interest: Active Aeroelastic Wing Shape Tailoring for Aircraft Performance and Control Modern aircraft are increasingly designed with light-weight, flexible airframe structures. By employing distributed flight control surfaces, a modern wing structure (which implies aircraft wing, horizontal stabilizer, and vertical stabilizer) can be strategically tailored in-flight by actively controlling the wing shape so as to bring about certain desired vehicle characteristics. For example, active aeroelastic wing shape tailoring can be employed to control the wash-out distribution and wing deflection in such a manner that could result in improved aerodynamic performance such as reduced drag during cruise or increased lift during take-off. Another novel use of active aeroelastic wing shape tailoring is for flight control. By actively controlling flexible aerodynamic surfaces differentially or collectively, the motion of an aircraft can be controlled in all three stability axes. In high speed supersonic or hypersonic vehicles, effects of airframe-propulsion-structure interactions can be significant. Thus, propulsion control can play an integral role with active aeroelastic wing shape tailoring control in high speed flight regimes. Technology development of active aeroelastic wing shape tailoring may include, but are not limited to the following:Innovative aircraft concepts that can significantly improve aerodynamic, performance and control by leveraging active aeroelastic wing shape tailoring. Sensor technology that will enable in-flight wing twist and deflection static and dynamic measurements for control development. Actuation methods that include novel modes of operation and concepts of actuation for actively controlling wing shape in-flight. Vehicle dynamic modeling capability that includes effects of aero-propulsive-servo-elasticity for vehicle control and dynamics. Integrated approaches for active aeroelastic wing shape tailoring control with novel control effector concepts that will provide multi-objective advanced optimal or adaptive control strategies to achieve simultaneously aerodynamic performance such as trim drag reduction, aeroelastic stabilization or mode suppression, and load limiting. Gust Load Alleviation Control In a future NextGen operational concept, close separation between aircraft in super density operations could lead to more frequent wake vortex encounters. Airframe flexibility in modern aircraft will inherently lead to a potential increase in vehicle dynamic response to turbulence and wake vortices. Gust load alleviation control technology can improve ride qualities and reduce undesired structural dynamic loading on flexible airframes that could shorten aircraft service life. Gust load alleviation control technology can be either reactive or predictive. In a traditional reactive control framework, flight control systems can be designed to provide sufficient aerodynamic damping characteristics that suppress vehicle dynamic response as rapidly as possible upon a turbulence encounter. There is a trade off, however, between increased damping for mode suppression and command-following objectives of a flight control system. Large damping ratios, while desirable for mode suppression, may result in poor flight control performance. Predictive control can provide a novel gust load alleviation strategy for future aircraft design with light-weight flexible structures. Novel look-ahead sensor technology can measure or estimate turbulent intensity to provide such information to a predictive gust load alleviation control system which in turn would dynamically reconfigure flight control surfaces as an aircraft enters a turbulent atmospheric region. Technology development of predictive gust load alleviation control may include, but are not limited to the following:Novel sensor methods for Optical Air Data Systems based on LIDAR or other novel detection methods that can measure near-field air turbulent velocity components directly in front of an aircraft in the order of one-body length scale to provide nearly instantaneous predictive capability to significantly improve the effectiveness of a gust load alleviation control system. Predictive gust load alleviation control approaches or other effective methods that can reliably reconfigure flight control surfaces dynamically based on the sensor information of the near-field turbulence to mitigate the vehicle structural dynamic response upon a turbulence encounter. The predictive control strategies should be cognizant of potential adverse effects due to potential latency issues that can counteract the objective of gust load alleviation, or potential structural mode interactions due to control input signals that may contain frequencies close to the natural frequencies of the airframe. Advanced Control Concepts for Propulsion Systems Enabling high performance ""Intelligent Engines"" will require advancement in the state of the art of propulsion system control. Engine control architectures/methods need to be developed that provide a tighter bound control on engine parameters for improved propulsion efficiency while maintaining safe operation. The ability of the controller to maintain its designed improvement of engine operation over the entire life and particular health condition of the propulsion system is critical. The controller needs to adapt to the specific health conditions of each engine to eventually allow for a ""personalized"" control, which will maintain the most efficient operation throughout the engine lifetime and increase the useful operating life. Possible advanced engine control concepts could include:Direct nonlinear control design such as predictive model based methods to directly control engine thrust while maintaining safety limits such as stall margins. Model-Based Multivariable control to allow direct control of quantities of interest such as thrust, temperature and stall margins while using all available actuators for feedback. Adaptive control schemes to maintain robust performance with changing engine condition with usage. Read less>>"
Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics ,"A2.08Aircraft Systems Analysis, Design and Optimization", LaRC," ARC, GRC","One of the approaches to achieve the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Program goals is to solve the aeronautics challenges for a broad range of air vehicles with system-level optimization, assessment and technology integration. The needs to meet this approach can be defined by three general themes:Variable Fidelity, Physics-Based Design/Analysis Tools. Technology Assessment and Integration. Evaluation of Advanced Concepts.Current interdisciplinary design/analysis involves a multitude of tools not necessarily developed to work together, hindering their application to complete system design/analysis studies. NASA has developed a capability that integrates several conceptual design/analysis tools and models in ModelCenter. In addition, development work is continuing on a python-based, open-source architecture (OpenMDAO) that should serve as the long term solution for a multi-fidelity, multi-disciplinary optimization framework. Solicited topics are targeted around these three themes that will support this NASA research area. Variable Fidelity, Physics-Based Design/Analysis Tools An integrated design process combines high-fidelity computational analyses from several disciplines with advanced numerical design procedures to simultaneously perform detailed Outer Mold Line (OML) shape optimization, structural sizing, active load alleviation control, multi-speed performance (e.g., low takeoff and landing speeds, but efficient transonic cruise), and/or other detailed-design tasks. Current practice still widely uses sequential, single-discipline optimization, at best coupling low-fidelity modeling of other relevant disciplines during the detailed design phase. Substantial performance improvements will be realized by developing closely integrated design procedures coupled with highest-fidelity analyses for use during detailed-design. Design procedures must enable rapid determination of sensitivities (gradients) of a design objective with respect to all design variables and constraints, choose search directions through design space without violating constraints, and make appropriate changes to the vehicle shape (ideally both external OML shape and internal structural element size). Solicitations are for integrated design optimization tools that find combinations of design variables from more than one discipline and can vary synergistically to produce superior performance compared to the results of sequential, single-discipline optimization or repeated cut-and-try analysis. Research challenges include the engineering details needed to numerically zoom (i.e., numerical analysis at various levels of detail) between multi-fidelity components of the same discipline, as well as, multi-discipline components of the same fidelity. A major computer science challenge is developing boundary objects that will be reused in a wide variety of simulations. Proposals will be considered that enable coupling differing disciplines, numerical zooming within a single discipline, deploying large simulations and assembling and controlling secure or non-secure simulations. Technology Assessment and Integration Improved analysis capability of integrated airframe and propulsion systems would allow more efficient designs to be created that would maximize efficiency and performance while minimizing both noise and emissions. Improved integrated system modeling should allow designers to consider trade-offs between various design and operating parameters to determine the optimum design for various classes of subsonic fixed wing aircraft ranging from personal aircraft to large transports. The modeling would also be beneficial if it had enough fidelity to enable it to analyze both conventional and unconventional systems. Current analysis tools capable of analyzing integrated systems are based on simplified physical and semi-empirical models that are not fully capable of analyzing aircraft and propulsion system parameters that would be required for new or unconventional systems. Analysis tools are solicited that are capable of analyzing new and unconventional aircraft and propulsion integrated systems. These include:New combustor designs, alternate fuel operation, and the ability to estimate all emissions. Noise source models (e.g., fan, jet, turbine, core and airframe components). Analyses tools that are scalable, especially to small aircraft, are desired. Evaluation of Advanced Concepts Conceptual design and analysis of unconventional vehicle concepts and technologies is needed for technology portfolio investment planning, development of advanced concepts to provide technology pull, and independent technical assessment of new concepts. This capability will enable ""virtual expeditions through the design space"" for multi-mission trade studies and optimization. This will require an integrated variable fidelity concept design system. The aerospace flight vehicle conceptual design phase is, in contrast to the succeeding preliminary and detail design phases, the most important step in the product development sequence, because of its predefining function. However, the conceptual design phase is the least well understood part of the entire flight vehicle design process, owing to its high level of abstraction and associated risk, its multidisciplinary design complexity, its permanent shortage of available design information, and its chronic time pressure to find solutions. Currently, the important primary aerospace vehicle design decisions at the conceptual design level (e.g., overall configuration selection) are still made using extremely simple analyses and heuristics. An integrated, variable fidelity system would have large benefits. Higher fidelity tools enabling unconventional configurations to be addressed in the conceptual design process are solicited.

Technologies of particular interest are as follows: Experimental Capabilities: Instrumentation and Techniques for Rotor Blade Measurements Instrumentation and measurement techniques are encouraged for assessing scale rotor blade boundary layer state (e.g., laminar, transition, turbulent flow) in simulated hover and forward flight conditions, measurement systems for large-field rotor wake assessment, and fast-response pressure sensitive paints applicable to blade surfaces.

Exterior noise topics of interest include, but are not limited to, noise prediction methods that address the understanding of issues such as noise generation, propagation, and control. These methods may address topics such as novel or drastically improved source noise prediction methods, novel or drastically improved noise propagation methods (e.g., through the atmosphere) to understand and/or control noise sources and their impact on the community. Methods should address one or more of the major noise components such as: harmonic noise, broadband noise, blade-vortex interaction noise, high-speed impulsive noise, interactional noise, and/or low frequency noise (e.g., propagation, psychoacoustic effects, etc). Rotorcraft Power Train System Improvements Health management of rotorcraft power trains is critical. Predictive, condition-based maintenance improves safety, decreases maintenance costs, and increases system availability. Topics of interest include algorithm development, software tools and innovative sensor technologies to detect and predict the health and usage of rotorcraft dynamic mechanical systems in the engine and drive system. Rotorcraft health management technologies can include tools to: increase fault detection coverage and decrease false alarm rates; detect onset of failure, isolate damage, and assess damage severity; predict remaining useful life and maintenance actions required; system models, material failure models and correlation of failure under bench fatigue, seeded fault test and fielded data; tools to correlate propulsion system operational parameters back to actual usage and component fatigue life; Also of interest are advanced gear technologies for rotorcraft transmissions.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics ,A2.10Propulsion Systems, GRC, GRC,"This subtopic is divided into three parts. The first part is the Turbomachinery and Heat Transfer and the second part is Developments Needed in Turbulence Modeling for Propulsion Flowpaths and third is Propulsion System Integration: Turbomachinery and Heat Transfer There is a critical need for advanced turbomachinery and heat transfer concepts, methods and tools to enable NASA to reach its goals in the various Fundamental Aeronautics projects. These goals include dramatic reductions in aircraft fuel burn, noise, and emissions, as well as an ability to achieve mission requirements for Subsonic Rotary Wing, Subsonic Fixed Wing, Supersonics, and Hypersonics Project flight regimes. In the compression system, advanced concepts and technologies are required to enable higher overall pressure ratio, high stage loading and wider operating range while maintaining or improving aerodynamic efficiency. Such improvements will enable reduced weight and part count, and will enable advanced variable cycle engines for various missions. In the turbine, the very high cycle temperatures demanded by advanced engine cycles place a premium on the cooling technologies required to ensure adequate life of the turbine component. Reduced cooling flow rates and/or increased cycle temperatures enabled by these technologies have a dramatic impact on the engine performance. Proposals are sought in the turbomachinery and heat transfer area to provide the following specific items:Advanced instrumentation to enable time-accurate, detailed measurement of unsteady velocities, pressures and temperatures in three-dimensional flowfields such as found in turbomachinery components. This may include instrumentation and measurement systems capable of operating in conditions up to 900 degrees F and in the presence of shock-blade row interactions, as well as in high speed, transonic cascades. The instrumentation methods may include measurement probes, non-intrusive optical methods and post-processing techniques that advance the state of the art in turbomachinery unsteady flowfield measurement for purposes of accurately resolving these complex flowfield. Advanced compressor flow control concepts to enable increased high stage loading in single and multi-stage axial compressors while maintaining or improving aerodynamic efficiency and operability. Technologies are sought that would reduce dependence on traditional range extending techniques (such as variable inlet guide vane and variable stator geometry) in compression systems. These may include flow control techniques near the compressor end walls and on the rotor and stator blade surfaces. Technologies are sought to reduce turbomachinery sensitivity to tip clearance leakage effects where clearance to chord ratios may be on the order of 5% or above. Novel turbine cooling concepts are sought to enable very high turbine cooling effectiveness especially considering the manufacturability of such concepts. These concepts may include film cooling concepts, internal cooling concepts, and innovative methods to couple the film and internal cooling designs. Concepts proposed should have the potential to be produced with current or forthcoming manufacturing techniques. The availability of advanced manufacturing techniques may actually enable improved cooling designs beyond the current state-of-the-art. Developments Needed in Turbulence Modeling for Propulsion Flowpaths and Propulsion System Integration Flowpaths within propulsion systems are characterized by several aerodynamic and thermodynamic features which are very difficult for currently available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods to calculate accurately. Experiments alone are limited in their ability to provide detailed insights to the complex flow physics which occur in advanced propulsion-airframe integrated systems for future subsonic, supersonic and hypersonic applications. Therefore, the continued need for competent CFD methods to be used in conjunction with experiments is high. The one CFD modeling area that has remained the most challenging, yet most critical to the success of integrated propulsion system simulations is turbulence modeling. The flow features specific to the propulsion system components that provide the greatest turbulence modeling challenges include separated flows whether they be from subsonic diffusion or turbulent shock wave-boundary layer interactions, inlet/vehicle forebody boundary layer transition, unsteady flowfields resulting from incorporation of active flow control, strongly three-dimensional and curved flows in turbomachinery, turbulent-chemistry interactions from subsonic combustors to scramjets, and heat transfer. Propulsion system integration challenges are encountered across all of the speed regimes from subsonic ""N+3"" vehicle concepts (with projected fuel burn benefits from boundary layer ingestion or distributed propulsion systems, for example), to supersonic ""N+2"" vehicle concepts with low-boom, high-performance inlets and nozzles integrated with variable cycle engine systems, to hypersonic reusable air-breathing launch vehicle concepts which incorporate integrated combined-cycle propulsion systems. Proposals suggesting innovative approaches to any of these problems are encouraged; specific areas of interest include:Advancement of turbulence modeling for shock wave-boundary layer interactions. Advancement of Reynolds-stress closure models for propulsion flowpath analyses, including application of LES and or DNS for model development and validation. Development of mid-level CFD models for the interaction of turbulence and chemical reaction that give superior results to the simple models (e.g., Magnussen), but which do not require the large computational expense of the very complex models (e.g., PDF evolution methods). Advancement of boundary layer transition models, especially in cases of low freestream turbulence levels that occur in actual flight. Incorporation of NASA high-order accurate numerical methods (e.g., Flux Reconstruction) into propulsion CFD tools using both structured as well as unstructured meshes. Development of methods and software tools to quantify uncertainty as part of the CFD solution procedure.Development of meaningful metrics that quantify the difference between computed solutions and experimental data and use the metrics to validate the CFD codes. Development of tools to enable rapid post-processing and assessment of CFD solutions, especially from NASA in-house CFD tools such as Wind-US and VULCAN (e.g., automatically interpolating numerical solutions to the measurement locations, generating ""metrics of goodness"" for parameters of interest, etc.). Propulsion integration topics:Development of methodologies that provide installed nozzle performance, specifically conceptual level design/analysis methods, capable of addressing conventional and unconventional geometries. Geometries should be valid for subsonic, supersonic, and/or hypersonic flight applications. Documentation of methodologies should include: underlying theory and mathematical models, computational solution methods, source-code, validation data, and limitations. Technologies and/or concepts to enable integrated, high-performance, light-weight supersonic inlets and nozzles that have minimal impact on an aircraft's sonic boom signature. Development of supersonic inlet systems that are ""Fail Safe"" and require no net mass extraction (i.e., bleed) or mass injection to control the shock wave/boundary-layer separations that inevitably arise in any supersonic inlet. Shorter, accurate, robust inlet mass flow measurement systems to replace the classic cold pipe/mass flow plug and measure mass-flow with distorted inflow. Read less>>"

By using state-of-the-art flight test techniques, measurement and data acquisition technologies, NASA will be able to operate its flight research facilities more effectively and also meet the challenges presented by NASA's cutting edge research and development programs. The Aeronautical Test Program pertains to a variety of flight regimes and vehicle types ranging from civil transports, low-speed, to high-altitude long-endurance to supersonic, to hypersonic and access-to-space. The scope of this subtopic is broad. Flight research and test capabilities should address (but are not limited to) the following NASA aeronautical test facilities: Aeronautical Test Range, Aero-Structures Flight Loads Laboratory, Flight Research Simulation Laboratory, and Research Test Bed Aircraft.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A5 Integrated System Research Project (ISRP) ,A5.01UAS Integration in the NAS, AFRC," ARC, GRC, LaRC","The following subtopic is in support of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Integration in the National Airspace System (NAS) Project under ISRP. There is an increasing need to fly UAS in the NAS to perform missions of vital importance to National Security and Defense, Emergency Management, Science, and to enable Commercial Applications. UAS are unable to routinely access the NAS today due to a lack of:Automated separation assurance integrated with collision avoidance systems. Robust communication technologies. Robust human systems integration. Standardized safety and certification.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations are built upon the condition of a pilot being in aircraft. There exist few, if any, regulations specifically addressing UAS today. The primary user of UAS to date has been the military. The technologies and procedures to enable seamless operation and integration of UAS in the NAS need to be developed, validated, and employed by the FAA through rule making and policy development. The Project goal is to develop capabilities that reduce technical barriers related to the safety and operational challenges associated with enabling routine UAS access to the NAS. This goal will be accomplished through a two-phased approach based on development of system-level integration of key concepts, technologies and/or procedures, and demonstrations of integrated capabilities in an operationally relevant environment. The project is further broken down into five subprojects: Separation Assurance; Communications; Human Systems Integration; Certification; and Integrated Test and Evaluation. The fifth sub-project, Integrated Test and Evaluation, integrates the other four subprojects. The Phase I technical objectives include:Developing a gap analysis between current state of the art and NextGen Concept of Operations. Validating the key technical elements identified by the project requirements. Initial modeling, simulation, and flight testing. Completion of subproject Phase I deliverables (Spectrum requirements, comparative analysis of certification methodologies, etc.) and continue Phase II preparation (infrastructure, tools, etc.).The Phase II technical objectives include:Providing regulators with a methodology for developing airworthiness requirements for UAS, and data to support development of certifications standards and regulatory guidance. Providing systems-level, integrated testing of concepts and/or capabilities that address barriers to routine access to the NAS, through simulation and flight testing, address issues including separation assurance, communications requirements, and Human Systems Integration in operationally relevant environments.This solicitation seeks proposals to develop:Desktop Simulation System for Rapid Collection of Human-in-the-Loop Simulation Data. Study, design and build a desktop human-in-the-loop simulation system that integrates UAS ground control stations, unmanned vehicles, manned aircraft, and controller interfaces to rapidly evaluate concepts for separation assurance, separation algorithms, procedures for off-nominal conditions, and other research questions. In addition, investigate training requirements and verification methods for the quality of the data, the types of tasks for which such a system could provide meaningful data, and the architecture required to ensure scalability. The simulation system could be based on the Multi Aircraft Control System (MACS), which already includes all those elements except the UAS ground control station. An initial implementation could include a single human operator with all other agents simulated, while advanced implementations would connect several instances of the simulator to capture interactions between human controllers, pilots and UAS operators. UAS Model Construction from Real-time Surveillance Data. In order to improve trajectory predictions for aircraft types without detailed models, a real-time system identification process is needed to automatically construct propulsion and aerodynamics models from available Air Traffic Control (ATC) surveillance data (primary or secondary radar, ADS-B, etc.) while the aircraft is in flight. Initial work would establish what real-time surveillance data is required for a model of sufficient fidelity to reliably predict aircraft trajectories ten or more minutes into the future and over tens of thousands of vertical feet, and what types of aircraft maneuvers would provide maximum observability of the unknown parameters (e.g., the vehicle's response to commanded doublets in altitude at max climb/descent speed or step changes in commanded aircraft velocity as observed by radar or ADS-B). These maneuvers would be commanded of the UAS by ATC to improve a poorly understood vehicle model in real-time. Model construction could also be done with archived surveillance data as a first step, but real-time construction is the preferred ultimate outcome. Certified control and non-payload communications (CNPC) system. Current civil UAS operations are significantly constrained by the lack of a standardized, certified control and non-payload communications (CNPC) system. The UAS CNPC system is to provide communications functions between the Unmanned Aircraft (UA) and the UA ground control station for such applications as: telecommands; non-payload telemetry; navigation aid data; air traffic control (ATC) voice relay; air traffic services (ATS) data relay; sense and avoid data relay; airborne weather radar data; and non-payload situational awareness video. New and innovative approaches to providing terrestrial and space-based high-bandwidth CNPC systems that are inexpensive, small, low latency, reliable, and secure offer opportunities for quantum jumps in UAS utility and capabilities. Of particular interest are technologies for the enhancement/improvement of CNPC performance for UAS operations in urban locations, taking into account the propagation, reflection/refraction and shadowing/blockage environment encountered in the urban environment. System for Rapid Automated UAS Mission Planning. UAS mission planning is currently a very cumbersome and time-consuming activity that involves a highly manual process. In order to provide better UAS integration in the NAS, an automated mission planning system is required with the following capabilities: During the pre-flight mission phase, automation is needed to identify emergency landing sites, ditch sites, and develop UAS responses to contingency events at all points along the route commensurate with UAS platform performance. During the in-flight mission phase, automation is needed to assess and integrate real-time weather information, such as that provided via Flight Information Services - Broadcast (FIS-B), to dynamically re-plan the route for safe navigation. This includes fuel planning and weather assessment capabilities to select and fly to appropriate alternate destination airfields.

Innovative lidar component technologies that directly address the measurements of the atmosphere and surface topography of the Earth, Mars, the Moon, and other planetary bodies will be considered under this subtopic. Frequency-stabilized lasers for a number of lidar applications such as CO2 concentration measurements as well as for highly accurate measurements of the distance between spacecraft for gravitational wave astronomy and gravitational field planetary science are among technologies of interest. Single longitudinal mode lasers and optical filter technologies for high spectral resolution lidars are also of interest.

Examples of planned missions and technology programs are: Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), Doppler Wind Lidar, Lidar for Surface Topography (LIST), Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS), and Aerosols-Clouds-Ecosystems (ACE). In addition, innovative technologies relevant to the NASA sub-orbital programs, such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Venture-class focusing on the studies of the Earth climate, carbon cycle, weather, and atmospheric composition, are being sought.

Mission concepts for New Worlds science would require 10 - 30 m class, cost-effective telescope observatories that are diffraction limited at wavelengths from the visible to the far IR, and operate at temperatures from 4 - 300 K. In addition, ground based telescopes such as the Cerro Chajnantor Atacama Telescope (CCAT) require similar technology development.The desired areal density is 1 - 10 kg/m2 with a packaging efficiency of 3-10 deployed/stowed diameter. Static and dynamic wavefront error tolerances to thermal and dynamic perturbations may be achieved through passive means (e.g., via a high stiffness system, passive thermal control, jitter isolation or damping) or through active opto-mechanical control. Large deployable multi-layer structures in support of sunshades for passive thermal control and 20m to 50m class planet finding external occulters are also relevant technologies. Potential architecture implementations must package into an existing launch volume, deploy and be self-aligning to the micron level. The target space environment is expected to be the Earth-Sun L2.

Active lightweight x-ray imaging mirrors for future very large advanced x-ray observatories. Large aperture, lightweight mirrors for future UV/Optical telescopes. Broadband high reflectance coatings for future UV/Optical telescopes. X-ray mirrors are identified by the Decadal as the most important, critical technology needed for IXO. IXO requires 3 m2 collecting aperture x-ray imaging mirror with 5 arc-second angular resolution. Mirror areal density depends upon available launch vehicle capacities. Additionally, future x-ray missions require advanced multilayer high-reflectance coating for hard x-ray mirrors (i.e., NuSTAR) and x-ray transmission/reflection gratings. Future UVOIR missions require 4 to 8 or 16 meter monolithic and/or segmented primary mirrors with 2 for a 5 m fairing EELV vs. 60 kg/m2 for a 10 m fairing SLS). Additionally, future UVOIR missions require high-reflectance mirror coatings with spectral coverage from 100 to 2500 nm. Heliophysics missions also require advanced lightweight, super-polished precision normal and grazing incidence optical components and coatings. Potential missions which could be enabled by these technologies include: Origins of Near-Earth Plasma (ONEP); Ion-Neutral Coupling in the Atmosphere (INCA); Dynamic Geospace Coupling (DGC); Fine-scale Advanced Coronal Transition-Region Spectrograph (FACTS); Reconnection and Micro-scale (RAM); and Solar-C. Heliophysics missions need normal incidence mirror systems ranging from 0.35 meter to 1.5 meters with surface figure errors of 0.1 micro-radians rms slope from 4-mm to 1/2 aperture spatial periods, roughness of 0.2-nm rms and micro-roughness of 0.1-nm rms; and, grazing incidence mirror systems with an effective collecting area of ~3 cm2 from 0.1 to 4 nm, 4 meter effective focal length, 0.8 degree angle of incidence and surface roughness of 0.2-nm rms. Additionally, future Heliophysics missions require high-reflectance normal incidence spectral, broadband, dual and even three-band pass multi-layer EUV coatings. The geosynchronous orbit for GEO-CAPE coastal ecosystem imager requires technology for alternative solar calibration strategies including new materials to reduce weight, and new optical analysis to reduce the size of calibration systems. GEO-CAPE will need a lightweight large aperture (greater than 0.5 m) diffuse solar calibrator, employing multiple diffusers to track on-orbit degradation. Typical materials of interest are PTFE (such as Spectralon® surface diffuser) or development of new Mie scattering materials for use as volume diffusers in transmission or reflection. Finally, NASA is developing a heavy lift space launch system (SLS). An SLS with a 10 meter fairing and 100 mt capacity to LEO would enable extremely large space telescopes. Potential systems include 12 to 30 meter class segmented primary mirrors for UV/optical or infrared wavelengths and 8 to 16 meter class segmented x-ray telescope mirrors. These potential future space telescopes have very specific mirror technology needs. UV/optical telescopes (such as ATLAST-9 or ATLAST-16) require 1 to 3 meter class mirrors with In all cases, the most important metric for an advanced optical system is affordability or areal cost (cost per square meter of collecting aperture). Currently both x-ray and normal incidence space mirrors cost $3 million to $4 million per square meter of optical surface area. This research effort seeks a cost reduction for precision optical components by 20 to 100 times, to less than $100K/m2. The subtopic has three objectives: Develop and demonstrate technologies to manufacture and test ultra-low-cost precision optical systems for x-ray, UV/optical or infrared telescopes. Potential solutions include, but are not limited to, new mirror materials such as silicon carbide, nanolaminates or carbon-fiber reinforced polymer; or new fabrication processes such as direct precision machining, rapid optical fabrication, roller embossing at optical tolerances, slumping or replication technologies to manufacture 1 to 2 meter (or larger) precision quality mirror or lens segments (either normal incidence for UV/optical/infrared or grazing incidence for x-ray). Solutions include reflective, transmissive, diffractive or high order diffractive blazed lens optical components for assembly of large (16 to 32 meter) optical quality primary elements. The EUSO mission requires large-aperture primary segmented refractive, Fresnel or kinoform PMMA or CYTOP lenses with Develop and demonstrate optical coatings for EUV and UVOIR telescopes. UVOIR telescopes require broadband (from 100 nm to 2500 nm) high-reflectivity mirror coating with extremely uniform amplitude and polarization properties. Heliophysics missions require high-reflectance (> 90%) normal incidence spectral, broadband, dual and even three-band pass multi-layer coatings over the spectral range from 6 to 200 nm. Studies of improved deposition processes for new UV reflective coatings (e.g., MgF2), investigations of new coating materials with promising UV performance, and examination of handling processes, contamination control, and safety procedures related to depositing coatings, storing coated optics, integrating coated optics into flight hardware are all areas where progress would be valuable. In all cases, an ability to demonstrate optical performance on 2 to 3 meter class optical surfaces is important.

Science,Topic S3 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems ,"S3.05Power Electronics and Management, and Energy Storage", GRC," ARC, JPL, JSC","Future NASA science objectives will include missions such as Earth Orbiting, Venus, Europa, Titan/Enceladus Flagship, Lunar Quest and Space Weather missions. Under this subtopic, proposals are solicited to develop energy storage and power electronics to enable or enhance the capabilities of future science missions. The unique requirements for the power systems for these missions can vary greatly, with advancements in components needed above the current State of the Art (SOA) for high energy density, high power density, long life, high reliability, low mass/volume, radiation tolerance, and wide temperature operation. Other subtopics that could potentially benefit from these technology developments include S5.05 - Extreme Environments Technology, and S5.01 - Planetary Entry, Descent and Landing Technology. Battery development could also be beneficial to X6.02 - Advanced Space-rated Batteries, which is investigating some similar technologies in the secondary battery area but with very different operational requirements. Power Management and Distribution could be beneficial to X8.05 - Advanced Power Conversion, Management and Distribution (PMAD) for High Power Space Exploration Applications, which is investigating some similar technologies but at a much higher power level. This subtopic is also directly tied to S3.04 - Propulsion Systems for the development of advanced Power Processing Units and associated components. Power Electronics and Management The 2009 Heliophysics roadmap (http://sec.gsfc.nasa.gov/2009_Roadmap.pdf), the 2010 SMD Science Plan (http://science.nasa.gov/about-us/science-strategy/), the 2010 Planetary Decadal Survey White Papers & Roadmap Inputs (http://sites.nationalacademies.org/SSB/CurrentProjects/ssb_052412(link is external)), the 2011 PSD Relevant Technologies document, the 2006 Solar System Exploration (SSE) Roadmap (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/about-us/science-strategy), and the 2003 SSE Decadal Survey describe the need for lighter weight, lower power electronics along with radiation hardened, extreme environment electronics for planetary exploration. Radioisotope power systems (RPS) and Power Processing Units (PPUs) for Electric Propulsion (EP) are two programs of interest that would directly benefit from advancements in this technology area. Advances in electrical power technologies are required for the electrical components and systems for these future platforms to address program size, mass, efficiency, capacity, durability, and reliability requirements. In addition, the Outer Planet Assessment Group has called out high power density/high efficiency power electronics as needs for the Titan/Enceladus Flagship and planetary exploration missions. These types of missions, including Mars Sample Return using Hall thrusters and PPUs, require advancements in radiation hardened power electronics and systems beyond the state-of-the-art. Of importance are expected improvements in energy density, speed, efficiency, or wide-temperature operation (-125oC to over 450oC) with a number of thermal cycles. Advancements are sought for power electronic devices, components and packaging for programs with power ranges of a few watts for minimum missions to up to 20 kilowatts for large missions. In addition to electrical component development, RPS has a need for intelligent, fault-tolerant Power Management And Distribution (PMAD) technologies to efficiently manage the system power for these deep space missions. SMD's In-space Propulsion Technology and Radioisotope Power Systems programs are direct customers of this subtopic, and the solicitation is coordinated with the 2 programs each year. Overall technologies of interest include: High voltage, radiation hardened, high temperature components, such as capacitors and semiconductors, for EP PPU applications. High power density/high efficiency power electronics. High temperature devices and components/power converters (up to 450oC). Intelligent, fault-tolerant electrical components and PMAD systems. Advanced electronic packaging for thermal control and electromagnetic shielding. In addition, development is needed in the area of advanced High Voltage Transformer-Rectifier Technology Development for Advanced Cloud and Precipitation Radars, Interferometers, and other Advanced SAR applications where an integrated Transformer-Rectifier Assembly is needed to provide increased stability in the output voltages provided to the Cathode and Collector of a Vacuum Tube (EIK). This would result in increases in the RF phase stability of the output RF Pulse or current approaches. The Transformer-Rectifier Assembly should address using innovative, single-integrated body regulator designs that regulate collector vs. cathode potential, and demonstrate increasing voltage stability over other approaches. The entire Transformer-Rectifier Assembly (Cathode-Collector-Body) should be optimized to achieve maximum energy efficiency and minimum size/mass of the system taking into account necessary high voltage insulation and potting for operation in a space environment (vacuum). Of interest are assemblies that demonstrate: Cathode voltages in excess of -12 kV, and Collector voltage in the -3 KV ranges with Beam currents in excess of 340 mA. Assemblies for which the primary winding of the transformer is driven through 60VDC (full load) switched at a nominal frequency of 40.5±1.5kHz, or higher. Duty cycles up to 16%. Energy Storage Future science missions will require advanced primary and secondary battery systems capable of operating at temperature extremes from -100oC for Titan missions to 400o to 500oC for Venus missions, and a span of -230°C to +120°C for Lunar Quest. The Outer Planet Assessment Group and the 2011 PSD Relevant Technologies Document have specifically called out high energy density storage systems as a need for the Titan/Enceladus Flagship and planetary exploration missions. In addition, high energy-density rechargeable electrochemical battery systems that offer greater than 50,000 charge/discharge cycles (10 year operating life) for low-Earth-orbiting spacecraft, 20-year life for geosynchronous (GEO) spacecraft, are desired. Advancements to battery energy storage capabilities that address one or more of the above requirements for the stated missions combined with very high specific energy and energy density (>200 Wh/kg for secondary battery systems), along with radiation tolerance are of interest. In addition to batteries, other advanced energy storage/load leveling technologies designed to the above mission requirements, such as flywheels, supercapacitors or magnetic energy storage, are of interest. These technologies have the potential to minimize the size and mass of future power systems. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II, and when possible, deliver a demonstration unit for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase II emphasis should be placed on developing and demonstrating the technology under relevant test conditions. Additionally, a path should be outlined that shows how the technology could be commercialized or further developed into science-worthy systems.

Patent 6,461,944(link is external), Methods for growth of relatively large step-free SiC crystal surfaces Neudeck, et al. October 8, 2002 Summary: A method for growing arrays of large-area device-size films of step-free (i.e., atomically flat) SiC surfaces for semiconductor electronic device applications is disclosed. This method utilizes a lateral growth process that better overcomes the effect of extended defects in the seed crystal substrate that limited the obtainable step-free area achievable by prior art processes. The step-free SiC surface is particularly suited for the heteroepitaxial growth of 3C (cubic) SiC, AlN, and GaN films used for the fabrication of both surface-sensitive devices (i.e., surface channel field effect transistors such as HEMT's and MOSFET's) as well as high-electric field devices (pn diodes and other solid-state power switching devices) that are sensitive to extended crystal defects.

Science,Topic S3 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems ,S3.07Terrestrial and Planetary Balloons, GSFC, JPL,"NASA's Scientific Balloons provide practical and cost effective platforms for conducting discovery science, development and testing for future space instruments, as well as training opportunities for future scientists and engineers. Balloons can reach altitudes above 36 kilometers, with suspended masses up to 3600 kilograms, and can stay afloat for several weeks. Currently, the Balloon Program is on the verge of introducing an advanced balloon system that will enable 100-day missions at mid latitudes and thus resemble the performance of a small spacecraft at a fraction of the cost. In support of this development, NASA is seeking innovative technologies in three key areas to monitor and advance the performance of this new vehicle. Power Storage Devices or methods to store electrical energy onboard the balloon with lower mass than current techniques are needed. Long duration balloon flights at mid-latitudes will experience up to 12 hours of darkness, during which electrical power is needed for experiments and NASA support systems. Typically, solar panels are flown to generate power during the daylight hours, and excess power is readily available. This excess power needs to be stored for use during the night. Current power storage techniques consist of rechargeable batteries that range from lead-acid to lithium-ion chemistries. Innovative alternatives to these batteries, either advanced chemistries or alternate power storage techniques such as capacitors or flywheels, which result in overall mass savings are needed. Nominal voltage levels for balloon systems are 28 volts DC, and nominal power levels can vary from 100 watts to 1000 watts. Therefore, power storage requirements range from 1000 watt-hours to 12,000 watt-hours or more. Alternative power systems that do not rely on solar panels may also be proposed. These alternative systems may use energy storage techniques such as fuel cells or flywheels, which are prepared or charged on the ground prior to flight, and then would provide continuous power throughout the flight at the power levels specified above. Balloon Instrumentation Devices or methods are desired to accurately measure ambient air temperature, helium gas temperature, balloon film temperatures, film strain, and tendon load. These measurements are needed to accurately model the balloon performance during a typical flight at altitudes of approximately 36 kilometers. The measurements must compensate for the effects of direct solar radiation through shielding or calculation. Minimal mass and volume are highly desired. Remote sensing of the parameters and non-invasive and non-contact approaches are also desired. The non-invasive and non-contact approaches are highly desired for the thin polyethylene film measurements used as the balloon envelope, with film thickness ranging from 0.8 to 1.5 mil. Strain measurements of these thin films via in-flight photogrammetric techniques would be beneficial. Devices or methods to accurately measure axially loaded tendons on an array of ~50 or up to 300 separate tendons during flight are of interest. Tendons are typically captured at the end fittings via individual pins with loading levels ranging from ~20 N to ~8,000 N per tendon, and can be exposed to temperatures from room temperature to the troposphere temperatures of -90 degrees Celsius or colder. The measurement devices must be compatible with existing NASA balloon packaging, inflation, and launch methods. These instruments must also be able to interface with existing NASA balloon flight support systems or alternatively, a definition of a data acquisition solution be provided. Support telemetry systems are not part of the this initiative; however, data from any sensors (devices) that are selected from this initiative must be able to be stored on board and/or telemetered in-flight using single-channel (two-wire) interface into existing NASA balloon flight support systems. The devices of interest shall be easily integrated and shall have minimal impact on the overall mass of the balloon system. Low-Cost Variable Conductance Heat Pipes for Balloon Payloads With the ever-increasing complexity of both scientific instruments and NASA mission support equipment, advanced thermal control techniques are needed. The type of advanced thermal control techniques desired are similar to those utilized on large-budget orbital and deep space payloads (variable conductance heat pipes, diode heat pipes, loop heat pipes, capillary pumped loops, heat switches, louvers), but these techniques are far more expensive to implement on balloon payloads that their limited budgets can afford. Innovative solutions are sought that would allow these more advanced thermal control measures to be utilized with reduced expense. Though not considered ""cutting-edge technology"", commercial quality, constant conductance, copper-methanol heat pipes have begun to be utilized on balloon payloads to effectively move heat significant distances. The problem with these devices is that the conductance cannot effectively be reduced under cold operating or cold survival environment conditions without expending significant energy in an active heater to keep the condenser section warm. It is desirable to develop a cost-effective method of conducting the heat in this manner while allowing the flow to be reduced/eliminated when conditions warrant. Innovative thermal control techniques and devices developed must be inexpensive to implement. They must function reliably at balloon altitudes of 30-40 km and temperature ranges from -90°C to +40°C. They should require little or no energy consumption and provide the capability of moderating heat flow autonomously or by remote control under certain thermal conditions. Planetary Balloon Technologies Innovations in materials, structures, and systems concepts have enabled buoyant vehicles to play an expanding role in planning NASA's future Solar System Exploration Program. Balloons are expected to carry scientific payloads at Titan and Venus that will perform in situ investigations of their atmospheres and near surface environments. Both Titan and Venus feature extreme environments that significantly impact the design of balloons for those two worlds. Proposals are sought in the following areas: Steerable Antenna for Titan and Venus Telecommunications Many concepts for Titan and Venus balloons require high gain antennas mounted on the balloon gondola to transmit data directly back to Earth. This approach requires that the antenna remain pointed at the Earth despite the motions experienced during balloon flight. A beacon signal from the Earth will be available to facilitate pointing. Innovative concepts are sought for such an antenna and pointing system with the following characteristics: antenna diameter of 0.8 m, total mass of antenna and pointing system of = 10 kg, power consumption for the steering system = 5 W (avg.), pointing accuracy = 0.5 deg (continuous), hemispheric pointing coverage (2 pi steradians), azimuthal and rotational slew rates ( 30 deg/sec. It is expected that a Phase I effort will involve a proof-of-concept experiment leading to a plan for full scale prototype fabrication and testing in Phase II. Phase II testing will need to include an Earth atmosphere balloon flight in the troposphere to evaluate the proposed design under real flight conditions. Long-Life Ballonets for Titan Aerobots Maintenance of a pressurized balloon shape during large altitude changes requires an internal bladder, or ballonet, that can fill and discharge atmospheric gas and thereby maintain the total gas-filled volume. Ballonets are commonplace in terrestrial blimps and airships; however, the cryogenic 85 K temperature at Titan reduces the flexibility of polymer materials and greatly increases the likelihood of pinhole defect formation over time. Innovative concepts are sought for materials and system designs of a ballonet that can function pinhole-free at 85 K for a minimum of 6 months at Titan while executing repeated altitude excursions from 100 m to 10,000 m. The proposed ballonet design should be scalable across the range of 1 to 50 m3 in volume. Preference will be given to projects that do some cryogenic experimentation in Phase I that builds confidence in the viability of the proposed approach. Read less>>"

This subtopic solicits technologies that include the integration of critical subsystems required to allow small spacecraft to work collaboratively to create sparse arrays, large-scale or synthetic apertures, distributed sensors or clusters of sensors, and robotic technologies which could be used in space to perform novel missions using multiple spacecraft in a coordinated fashion. These technologies could include, but are not limited to: high precision timing systems combined with high precision attitude determination and control systems, satellite-to-satellite communications technologies, autonomous systems, and small, efficient in-space propulsion technologies. Proposers are asked to build a conceptual system/spacecraft design/operational scenario that details the architecture, components and specifications, as well as existing technology gaps necessary to replace the function of a single large spacecraft with an alternative that uses small spacecraft.

Sensing technologies are desired that determine the entry point of the spacecraft in the Mars atmosphere; provide inputs to systems that control spacecraft trajectory, speed, and orientation to the surface; locate the spacecraft relative to the Martian surface; evaluate potential hazards at the landing site; and determine when the spacecraft has touched down. Appropriate sensing technologies for this topic should provide measurements of physical forces or properties that support some aspect of EDL operations.

Science,Topic S5 Robotic Exploration Technologies ,"S5.02Sample Collection, Processing, and Handling", JPL," ARC, GSFC, JSC","Robust systems for sample acquisition, handling and processing are critical to the next generation of robotic explorers for investigation of planetary bodies (http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10432&page=R1(link is external)). Limited spacecraft resources (power, volume, mass, computational capabilities, and telemetry bandwidth) demand innovative, integrated sampling systems that can survive and operate in challenging environments (e.g., extremes in temperature, pressure, gravity, vibration and thermal cycling). Special interest lies in sampling systems and components (actuators, gearboxes, etc.) that are suitable for use in the extremely hot high-pressure environment at the Venusian surface (460ºC, 93 bar), as well as for asteroids and comets. Relevant systems could be integrated on multiple platforms, however of primary interest are samplers that could be mounted on a mobile platform, such as a rover. For reference, current Mars-relevant rovers range in mass from 200 - 800 kg. Sample Acquisition Research should be conducted to develop compact, low-power, lightweight subsurface sampling systems that can obtain 1 cm diameter cores of consolidated material (e.g., rock, icy regolith) up to 10 cm below the surface. Systems should be capable of autonomously acquiring and ejecting samples reliably, with minimal physical alteration of samples. Also of interest are methods of autonomously exposing rock interiors from below weathered rind layers. Other sample types of interest are unconsolidated regolith, dust, and atmospheric gas. Asteroid and comet samplers are also of interest. Sample Manipulation (e.g., core management, sub-sampling/sorting, powder transport) Sample manipulation technologies are needed to enable handling and transfer of structured and unstructured samples from a sampling device to instruments and sample processing systems. Core, cuttings, and regolith samples may be variable in size and composition, so a sample manipulation system needs to be flexible enough to handle the sample variability. Core samples will be on the order of 1 cm diameter and up to 10 cm long. Soil and rock fragment samples will be of similar volumes. Sample Integrity (e.g., encapsulation and contamination control) For a sample return mission, it is critical to find solutions for maintaining physical integrity of the sample during the surface mission (rover driving loads, diurnal temperature fluctuations) as well as the return to Earth (cruise, atmospheric entry and impact). Technologies are needed for characterizing state of sample in situ - physical integrity (e.g., cracked, crushed), sample volume, mass or temperature, as well as retention of volatiles in solid (core, regolith) samples, and retention of atmospheric gas samples. Also of particular need are means of acquiring subsurface rock and regolith samples with minimum contamination. This contamination may include contaminants in the sampling tool itself, material from one location contaminating samples collected at another location (sample cross-contamination), or Earth-source microorganisms brought to the Martian surface prior to drilling ('clean' sampling from a 'dirty' surface). Consideration should be given to use of materials and processes compatible with 110 - 125°C dry heat sterilization. In situ sterilization may be explored, as well as innovative mechanical or system solutions - e.g., single-use sample ""sleeves,"" or fully-integrated sample acquisition and encapsulation systems. For a sample return mission, solutions are sought for sample transfer of a payload into a planetary ascent vehicle including automated payload transfer mechanisms and Orbiting Sample (OS) sealing techniques. Sample Return Facility capabilities Technologies are needed for terrestrial handling of returned samples, including sample quarantine, biological activity and biohazard assessment, techniques for performing sample science.

For planetary bodies where gravity dominates, such as the Moon and Mars, many scientifically valuable sites are accessible only via terrain that is too difficult for state-of-the-art planetary rovers to traverse in terms of ground slope, rock obstacle size, plateaus, and non-cohesive soils types. Sites include crater walls, canyons, gullies, sand dunes, and high rock density regions. Tethered systems, non-wheeled systems, and marsupial systems are examples of mobility technologies that are of interest. Mars is particularly interested in fast traverse capabilities aimed at a fetch rover that would potentially need to travel a long distance to retrieve a sample cache deposited by a prior mission. For small planetary bodies with micro-gravity environments, novel access systems are desired to enable exploration and sample acquisition. Small body missions include Comet Surface Sample Return, Cryogenic Comet Sample Return, and asteroid Trojan Tour and Rendezvous. For surface and subsurface sampling, advanced manipulation technologies are needed to deploy instruments and tools from spacecraft, landers and rovers. Technologies to enable acquisition of subsurface samples are also needed. Technologies are needed to acquire core samples in the shallow subsurface to about 10cm and to enable subsurface sampling in multiple holes at least 1 - 3 meters deep through rock, regolith, or ice compositions.

Survivability in extreme high-temperatures and high-pressures is also required for deep atmospheric probes to giant planets. Proposals are sought for technologies that enable the in situ exploration of the surface and deep atmosphere of Venus and the deep atmospheres of Jupiter or Saturn for future NASA missions. Venus features a dense, CO2 atmosphere completely covered by sulfuric acid clouds at about 55 km above the surface, a surface temperature of about 486 degrees Centigrade and a surface pressure of about 90 bars. Technologies of interest include high-temperature and acid resistant high strength-to-weight textile materials for landing systems (balloons, parachutes, tethers, bridles, airbags), high-temperature electronics components, high-temperature energy storage systems, light-mass refrigeration systems, high-temperature actuators and gear boxes for robotic arms and other mechanisms, high-temperature drills, phase change materials for short term thermal maintenance, low-conductivity and high-compressive strength insulation materials, high-temperature optical window systems (that are transparent in IR, visible and UV wavelengths) and advanced materials with high-specific-heat-capacity and high-specific-strength for pressure vessel construction, and pressure vessel components compatible with materials such as steal, titanium and beryllium for applications like low leak rate wide-temperature (-50 degrees Centigrade C to 500 degrees Centigrade) seals capable of operating between 0 and 90 bars. Low-Temperature Environments Low-temperature survivability is required for surface missions to Titan (-180 degrees Centigrade), Europa (-220 degrees Centigrade), Ganymede (-200 degrees Centigrade) and comets. Also the Earth's Moon equatorial regions experience wide temperature swings from -180 degrees Centigrade to +130 degrees Centigrade during the lunar day/night cycle, and the sustained temperature at the shadowed regions of lunar poles can be as low as -230 degrees Centigrade. Mars diurnal temperature changes from about -120 degrees Centigrade to +20 degrees Centigrade.

Science,Topic S5 Robotic Exploration Technologies ,S5.06Planetary Protection, JPL, LaRC,"Technologies intended for use at/around Mars, Europa (Jupiter), and Enceladus (Saturn) must be developed so as to ensure compliance with relevant planetary protection requirements. NASA seeks innovative technologies to facilitate meeting Forward and Backward Contamination Planetary Protection objectives especially for a potential Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission and to facilitate Forward Planetary Protection implementation for a potential mission to Europa.Backward Contamination Planetary Protection deals with the possibility that Mars (or other planetary) material may pose a biological threat to the Earth's biosphere. This leads to a constraint that returned samples of Mars material be contained with extraordinary robustness until they can be tested and proved harmless or be sterilized by an accepted method. Achieving this containment goal will require new technology for several functions. Containment assurance requires ""breaking the chain of contact"" with Mars: the exterior of the sample container must not be contaminated with Mars material. Also, the integrity of the containment must be verified, the sample container and its seals must survive the worst-case Earth impact corresponding to the candidate mission profile, and the Earth entry vehicle (EEV) must withstand the thermal and structural rigors of Earth atmosphere entry - all with an unprecedented degree of confidence. Backward Contamination Planetary Protection technologies for the following MSR functions are included in this call: Container Design, Sealing, & Verification: Options for sealing the sample container include (but are not limited to) brazing, explosive welding, and various types of soft seals, with sealing performed either on the Mars surface or in orbit. Confirmation of sealing can be provided by observation of sealing system parameters and by leak detection after sealing. Wireless data and power transmission may be needed to support such leak detection technologies. Additional containment using a flexible liner within the EEV that is sealed while in Mars orbit has also been considered. Further validation prior to Earth entry may also be needed. Breaking-the-Chain & Dust Mitigation: Several paths have been identified that would result in Mars material contaminating the outside of the sealed sample container and/or the Earth return vehicle (ERV). Technology options for mitigation include ejection of containment layers during ascent and orbit and/or capturing a contaminated ""Orbiting Sample"" into a clean container on the ERV and then ejecting the capture device. Meteoroid Protection & Breach Detection: Protection is required for both the sample container and the EEV heat shield. New lightweight shielding techniques are needed. Even with these, there may be a requirement for technology to detect a breach of the shield or damage to the EEV. Forward Contamination Planetary Protection technologies are desired, particularly for Mars and Europa missions that allow sterilization of previously non-sterilizable flight hardware by either i) dry heat processing or ii) gamma/e-beam irradiation. NASA also seeks to use iii) hydrogen peroxide vapor processes for resterilization of assembled flight hardware elements. Proposals are invited for innovative approaches to sterilization of flight hardware in the pre-flight environment using this technology. Note: this call is not for novel sterilization processes. For Europa, products and technologies are sought that can be demonstrated to be compatible with the three identified sterilization processes, as well as the environmental conditions of spaceflight and the Jovian system.Candidate technologies for the following functions and capabilities are included in this call: Sterilization Process Compatibility: Options for proving compatibility of novel product elements (materials, parts) with recognized spacecraft sterilization process parameters are desired. Redesign for Sterilization: Development of alternative solutions for spacecraft hardware is needed where there are known sterilization process incompatibilities. Current planning is to facilitate system-level sterilization of spacecraft, so heat tolerant technology solutions for sensors, seals (battery, valve), optical coatings, etc., are highly desired. Biobarrier Technology: Demonstration of novel biobarrier and recontamination prevention approaches for spacecraft hardware is needed when applying one or more of these three sterilization processes. Proposals should show an understanding of one or more relevant technology needs and present a feasible plan to fully develop a technology and infuse it into a NASA program.Read less>>"

This subtopic element seeks more intuitive, intelligent, user-customizable, and integrated interfaces to supercomputing resources, enabling users to more completely leverage the power of HEC to increase their productivity. Such an interface could enhance many essential supercomputing tasks: accessing and managing resources, training, getting services, developing codes (e.g., debugging and performance analysis), running computations, managing files and data, analyzing and visualizing results, transmitting data, collaborating, etc. Cloud Supercomputing Cloud computing has made tremendous promises, and demonstrated some success, for business computing. For operations, potential benefits include: resource virtualization, incremental and transparent provisioning, enhanced resource consolidation and utilization, automated resource management, automated job migration, and increased service availability, and others.

Here, ""low-cost"" is intended to capture multiple aspects of the investment in the methodology, including initial purchase, maintenance, and training/learning-curve.

Science,Topic S6 Information Technologies ,S6.05Fault Management Technologies, MSFC," ARC, JPL","As science missions are given increasingly complex goals and have more pressure to reduce operations costs, system autonomy increases. Fault Management (FM) is one of the key components of system autonomy. FM consists of the operational mitigations of spacecraft failures. It is implemented with spacecraft hardware, on-board autonomous software that controls hardware, software, information redundancy, and ground-based software and operations procedures. Many recent Science Mission Directorate (SMD) missions have encountered major cost overruns and schedule slips during test and verification of FM functions. These overruns are due to a lack of understanding of FM functions early in the mission definition cycles, and to FM architectures that do not provide attributes of transparency, verifiability, fault isolation capability, or fault coverage. The NASA FM Handbook is under development to improve the FM design, development, verification & validation and operations processes. FM approaches, architectures, and tools are needed to improve early understanding of needed FM capabilities by project managers and FM engineers, and to improve the efficiency of implementing and testing FM. Specific objectives are to: Improve ability to predict FM system complexity and estimate development and operations costs. Enable cost-effective FM design architectures and operations. Determine completeness and appropriateness of FM designs and implementations. Decrease the labor and time required to develop and test FM models and algorithms. Improve visualization of the full FM design across hardware, software, and operations procedures. Determine extent of testing required, completeness of verification planned, and residual risk resulting from incomplete coverage. Increase data integrity between multi-discipline tools. Standardize metrics and calculations across FM, SE, S&MA and operations disciplines. Increase reliability of FM systems. Expected outcomes are better estimation and control of FM complexity and development costs, improved FM designs, and accelerated advancement of FM tools and techniques. The approach of this subtopic is to seek the right balance between sufficient reliability and cost appropriate to the mission type and risk posture. Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, SMD missions. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and NASA relevance during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration. Offerors should demonstrate awareness of the state-of-the-art of their proposed technology, and should leverage existing commercial capabilities and research efforts where appropriate. Specific technology in the forms listed below is needed to increase delivery of high quality FM systems. These approaches, architectures and tools must be consistent with and enable the NASA FM Handbook concepts and processes. FM design tools: System modeling and analyses significantly contributes to the quality of FM design; however, the time it takes to translate system design information into system models often decreases the value of the modeling and analysis results. Examples of enabling techniques and tools are modeling automation, spacecraft modeling libraries, expedited algorithm development, sensor placement analyses, and system model tool integration. FM visualization tools: FM systems incorporate hardware, software, and operations mechanisms. The ability to visualize the full FM system and the contribution of each mechanism to protecting mission functions and assets is critical to assessing the completeness and appropriateness of the FM design to the mission attributes (mission type, risk posture, operations concept, etc.). Fault trees and state transition diagrams are examples of visualization tools that could contribute to visualization of the full FM design. FM verification and validation tools: As complexity of spacecraft and systems increases, the extensiveness of testing required to verify and validate FM implementations can be resource intensive. Automated test case development, false positive/false negative test tools, model verification and validation tools, and test coverage risk assessments are examples of contributing technologies. FM Design Architectures: FM capabilities may be implemented through numerous system, hardware, and software architecture solutions. The FM architecture trade space includes options such as embedded in the flight control software or independent onboard software; on board versus ground-based capabilities; centralized or distributed FM functions; sensor suite implications; integration of multiple FM techniques; innovative software FM architectures implemented on flight processors or on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs); and execution in real-time or off-line analysis post-operations. Alternative architecture choices could help control FM system complexity and cost and could offer solutions to transparency, verifiability, and completeness challenges. Multi-discipline FM Interoperation: FM designers, Systems Engineering, Safety and Mission Assurance, and Operations perform analyses and assessments of reliabilities, failure modes and effects, sensor coverage, failure probabilities, anomaly detection and response, contingency operations, etc. The relationships between multi-discipline data and analyses are inconsistent and misinterpreted. Resources are expended either in effort to resolve disconnects in data and analyses or worse, reduced mission success due to failure modes that were overlooked. Solutions that address data integrity, identification of metrics, and standardization of data products, techniques and analyses will reduce cost and failures. Read less>>"

Exploration Systems,Topic X3 Life Support and Habitation Systems ,X3.04Spacecraft Cabin Ventilation and Thermal Control, JSC," GRC, GSFC, JPL, LaRC, MSFC","Future spacecraft will require quieter fans, better cabin air filtration, and advanced active thermal control systems. Small Fan Aero-Acoustics Procedures and non-intrusive apparatus to measure the sound pressure levels in the inlet and exhaust duct of a candidate spacecraft ventilation fan are requested. Details of the aerodynamic design and the predicted aerodynamic performance of the candidate spacecraft cabin ventilation fan are reported in NASA CR-2010-216329, ""Aerodynamic Design and Computational Analysis of a Spacecraft Cabin Ventilation Fan"".

The pressure rise at design point for this fan (925 Pa) exceeds the maximum recommended (750 Pa) in ISO 10302. The procedure that is requested to be developed should apply to fans of similar size and capacity (or greater) as the identified candidate spacecraft ventilation fan. The procedure developed should overcome the deficiencies in the standards by providing plots of overall sound power levels as a function of fan flow rate (from full flow to fully throttled conditions) along lines of constant fan rotational speed in the inlet and exhaust ducts. Values of the radial and circumferential duct mode sound power levels calculated from the pressure measurement should be recorded and made available for subsequent examination at all tested conditions. It also must be shown that the flow-induced microphone self-noise, if any, does not contribute significantly to the measured fan sound pressure levels or sound power levels. Validation of the measured fan sound power levels must be shown for a sub-set of the performance range using an alternate technique. Methods of Particulate Separation and Filtration from Air Methods of particulate air filtration and/or separation targeting a range of particle sizes from tens of micron down to submicron in conjunction with efficient methods of regeneration are sought. The proposed technical solutions should reduce crew maintenance time and eliminate the need for consumable filter elements. These units should be able to handle large surges of particles and operate over very long periods. They should also be self-cleaning in-place (preferable) or off-line. Targeted technologies should be compact and lightweight, easily integrated with the spacecraft life support system, and provide viable methods for disposing of collected particulate matter while minimizing or eliminating direct contact by the crew. Active Thermal Control Systems Thermal control systems will be required that can dissipate a wide range of heat loads with widely varying environments while using fewer of the limited spacecraft mass, volume and power resources. The thermal control system designs must accommodate high input heat fluxes at the heat acquisition source and harsh thermal environments at the heat rejection sink.

Exploration Systems,Topic X4 Extra-Vehicular Activity Technology ,X4.02Space Suit Life Support Systems, JSC, GRC,"Advanced space suit life support systems are necessary for the successful support of the International Space Station (ISS) and future human space exploration missions for in-space microgravity EVA and planetary surface operations. Exploration missions will require a robust, lightweight, and maintainable Primary Life Support System (PLSS). The PLSS attaches to the space suit pressure garment and provides approximately an 8 hour supply of oxygen for breathing, suit pressurization, ventilation and CO2 removal, and a thermal control system for crew member metabolic heat rejection. Innovative technologies are needed for high-pressure O2 delivery, crewmember cooling, heat rejection, and removal of expired CO2 and water vapor. Focused research is needed in the following space suit life support system areas: Feedwater Supply Bladder for PLSS - Focused research is needed to develop a shallow, translucent water bladder that will serve to pressurize the water loop for the new PLSS by using the suit pressure to compress the flexible bladder material.

Exploration Systems,Topic X4 Extra-Vehicular Activity Technology ,"X4.03Space Suit Radio, Sensors, Displays, Cameras, and Audio", GRC, JSC,"Future EVAs need advances in radio technologies, including antennas, tunable RF front-ends, and power amplifiers; low-power cameras; more accurate, reliable, and packaged core temperature, CO2, and biomedical sensors; user-friendly, minimally invasive crewmember information displays; and technologies that provide improvements in speech quality, listening quality and listening effort for in-helmet aural and vocal communications. Progress in these technologies will help ensure reliable communications, crew safety and comfort, and work efficiency and autonomy. The focus of this subtopic is to advance future EVA lightweight, compact, low-power technologies in five primary areas: radios, sensors, displays, cameras, and suit audio. The expectation for all of these EVA areas is that a report demonstrating the concept, requirements, design, and technical feasibility will be delivered at the end of Phase I, and that a working and fully functional device will be delivered at the end of Phase II. The next-generation EVA radio needs to fulfill multiple functions while satisfying stringent requirements on size, weight and power (SWaP) consumption in the ISM S-band (2.4 - 2.483 GHz) and Ka-band (approximately 26 GHz). Ideally, eventual radio SwAP reductions would result in approximately 115 cubic inches, 3.5 - 5.5 pounds, and 15 watts total power consumption, respectively. Next-generation EVA radios will need to support multiple comm loops and point-to-point EVA comm., receive caution and warning messages from the vehicle and other EVA crew, receive, store, and display voice/text messaging to handle comm delays. Moreover, next-generation EVA antenna systems that effectively present uniform coverage around the suit are needed. Likewise, the next-generation EVA radio needs RF front-end architectures capable of presenting baseband or IF signals to waveform processing hardware in multiple bands. Radiation-hardened-by-design transceiver technologies improving upon current Single Event Upset tolerant approaches, along with cognitive technologies, are needed for future EVA exploration to Near Earth Asteroids and beyond. In addition, advances in tunable technology that permit high Q factor, minimum insertion losses, and excellent linearity are desirable at the given S- and Ka-band Gigahertz frequencies for agility. The next-generation EVA radios will need to support voice, telemetry, and standard/high definition video data flows (up to 20 Mbps); ensure rapid upgrades via scalable, open, and modular architectures; and, advance power aware technologies to optimize efficiency, conserve EVA battery lifetime power, and prolong duration of EVA operations. Finally, no matter what type of transceiver architecture is used in the next-generation EVA radio, the power amplifier is always a key component to enable new functionality, and to minimize the power consumption of the whole radio. Current amplifiers suffer from one or many of the following drawbacks: a) insufficient power added efficiency, b) insufficient linearity performance and incompatibility with modern modulation signals, and c) incompatible with silicon CMOS technology. Most of the commercial PAs are based on III-V GaAs material system, which is more expensive compared to the CMOS fabrication processes. Additionally, the incompatibility with silicon CMOS technology makes it impossible to realize a fully integrated radio-on-a-chip system. Consequently, the implemented radio with the existing power amplifiers requires much more SwAP and higher fabrication costs. Advances are needed in the efficiency and linearity of power amplifiers for next-generation EVA radio applications. Crew health and suit monitoring require advancement of lightweight CO2, biomedical (heart rate, blood OX, EKG) and core temperature sensors with reduced size, increased reliability, and greater packaging flexibility. Consequently, technologies are needed to provide high accuracy, low mass, and low-power sensors that measure flow rate, pressure, temperature, and relative humidity or dew point. All sensors must operate in a low pressure 100% O2 environment with high humidity and may be exposed to liquid condensate. Because missions must be designed with appropriate radiation shielding and adjusted to keep the radiation doses within tolerable limits, real-time, accurate, instantaneous and integrated radiation dose measurements and readout are needed such as novel dosimeter sensors. Given sufficient warning, astronauts can move to a more shielded part of the space vehicle and lessen dose impact. As cosmic rays impinge upon the vehicle leaving the magnetosphere, sensors are needed to determine the type of radiation and dose as well as reduce the potential risk of biological tissue damage. Future EVAs need a user-friendly and minimally invasive crewmember information display device that provides significant task efficiency improvement for a broad range of EVA tasks. Current Head-Mounted Display and Near-to-Eye display technologies are a non-starter for EVA, because the display must be mechanically decoupled from the user's head in order to improve crew safety, comfort, and prevent display misalignment. This in turn makes for more difficult specifications for the eyebox (tolerance to misalignment before image goes out of focus), field of view (angle of the image created by the optics), and eye relief (working distance from the eye to the last optical element). Additionally, current Helmet-Mounted Display technologies are challenged in EVA applications due to geometric constraints within the helmet, and future display technologies must ensure suit displays can operate outside the suit protection in thermal, radiation, and vacuum environments as well as internally without imposing ignition hazards due to 100% oxygen environment. Key performance parameters (targets) include: Graphical Data Presentation: SXGA @ 40 deg FOV (possibly biocular); Decoupled from User's Head - Large Eyebox: 100 mm x 100mm x 50mm (D); Sunlight Readability: 500 fL inside visor, 1800 fL outside visor (>10 to 1 contrast). Future EVAs need to support high definition motion and high resolution imagery with ultra compact, low-power HD cameras and low loss compressed digital data output for RF transmissions and/or IP networks. Hemispherical and dynamic cameras are desired, where hemispherical cameras take video views of a crewmember (360 degrees), distorting those views thru optics and then undistorting those views via software on the ground to pan/zoom for total situational awareness. Dynamic cameras can take stills and motion in variable bandwidths, capture image based on link quality, change frame rates, interfaced to gigabit Ethernet and in a rad-tolerant package with dynamically reconfigure compression core(s) and common 'back-end' interfaces. The space suit environment presents a unique challenge for capturing and transmitting speech communications to and from a crewmember. The in-suit acoustic environment is characterized by highly reflective surfaces, causing high levels of reverberation, as well as spacesuit-unique noise fields; and wide swings of static pressure levels. Due to these factors, the quality of speech delivered to and from the inside of a spacesuit helmet can be low and can have a negative effect on inbound and outbound speech intelligibility. The traditional approach to overcome the challenges of the spacesuit acoustic environment is to use a skullcap-based system of microphones and speakers. Cap-based systems are less successful, however, in attenuating high noise levels generated outside the spacesuit, and many logistical issues exist for head-mounted caps (e.g., crewmembers are not able to adjust the skullcap, headset or microphone booms during EVA operations, interference between the protuberances of the cap and other devices, comfort, hygiene, proper positioning and dislocation, and wire fatigue and blind mating of the connectors, multiple cap sizes to accommodate anthropometric variations in crew heads). NASA is seeking technologies in support of improvements in speech intelligibility, speech quality, listening quality and listening effort for in-helmet aural and vocal communications. The specific focus of this SBIR subtopic is on improving the interface between crewmember and the acoustic pickup (microphones) and generation (speaker) systems. Devices are sought to improve or resolve acoustic, physical and technical problems (listed above) that have been associated with skullcap-mounted speakers and microphones, or allow for the elimination of skullcap-mounted speakers and microphones. In particular, voice communications systems are sought that have provided crewmembers with adequate speech intelligibility over background noise within, and external to, the spacesuit. Overall system performance must provide Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for Listening Quality (Lq) and Listening Effort (Le) of 3.9 or greater, or Articulation Index (AI) of .7 or better or 90% Intelligibility in the crewmember's native language for both inbound and outbound speech communication. Specific technologies of interest include, but are not limited to: acoustic modeling of the in-suit acoustic environment, including the ability to model structure-borne vibration in helmet and suit structures as well as transduction to and from the acoustic medium; low-mass, low-volume, low-distortion, space-qualified speakers with low variation in sensitivity with static pressure. Changes in speaker sensitivity should be less than 2 dB over the speech band with changes in static pressure between 3 and 18 psia; low-mass, ultra-low-volume ( Read less>>"

They reduce the complexities of standard wires and connectors and enable sensing functions in locations not normally accessible with previous technologies. They allow NASA to gain insight into performance and safety of NASA vehicles as well as commercial launchers, vehicles and payloads supporting NASA missions. There is also a need for modular/low mass/volume smart NDE sensors systems and associated software that enable effective use with minimum crew training or re-familiarization after extended periods of no use.

Exploration Systems,Topic X6 Autonomous Systems and Avionics ,X6.01Spacecraft Autonomy and Space Mission Automation, ARC," JPL, JSC","Future human spaceflight missions will place crews at large distances and light-time delays from Earth, requiring novel capabilities for crews and ground to manage spacecraft consumables such as power, water, propellant and life support systems to prevent Loss of Mission (LOM) or Loss of Crew (LOC). This capability is necessary to handle events such as leaks or failures leading to unexpected expenditure of consumables coupled with lack of communications. If crews in the spacecraft must manage, plan and operate much of the mission themselves, NASA must migrate operations functionality from the flight control room to the vehicle for use by the crew. Migrating flight controller tools and procedures to the crew on-board the spacecraft would, even if technically possible, overburden the crew. Enabling these same monitoring, tracking, and management capabilities on-board the spacecraft for a small crew to use will require significant automation and decision support software.

Spacecraft vehicle electronics will be required to operate across a wide temperature range and must be capable of enduring frequent (and often rapid) thermal-cycling.

Safe, nutritious, acceptable, and varied shelf-stable foods with a shelf life of 3 - 5 years will be required to support the crew during these exploration missions. Concurrently, the food system must efficiently balance appropriate vehicle resources such as mass, volume, water, air, waste, power, and crew time. Refrigeration and freezing require dispensable resource utilization, so NASA provisions consist solely of shelf stable foods. Stability is achieved by thermal or irradiative processing to kill the microorganisms in the food or drying to prevent viability of the microorganisms. These methods do impact the micronutrients within the food substrate. Environmental factors (such as moisture ingress and oxidation) are also capable of compromising the nutrient content over the shelf life of the food. Since the food system is the designated source of nutrition to the crew, a significant loss in nutrient availability could significantly jeopardize the health and performance of the crew. Optimal nutritional content of the food for up to five years will ensure that the food can support crew performance and help protect their bodies from deficiencies that cause disease. Vitamin content in NASA foods, such as Vitamin C, Vitamin A, thiamin, and folic acid, is degraded during processing and as the product ages in storage. The goal is to develop a system that protects the vitamins from this degradation at ambient temperatures over a five year duration. Possible technologies that could be investigated to protect food ingredients from biological and chemical degradation of components over time include nanoscale technologies (e.g., encapsulation), biosensors, novel food ingredients, and controlled-release systems.

Exploration Systems,Topic X17 Inflight Biological Sample Preservation and Analysis ,X17.01Alternative Methods for Ambient Preservation of Human Biological Samples During Extended Spaceflight and Planetary Operations, JSC, ARC,"Addressing multiple Human Research Program (HRP) human health and performance risks and knowledge gaps across various disciplines requires collection, preservation and analysis of biological samples from human subjects during a space mission, a common practice in clinical diagnostic medicine. However, the spaceflight environment affords unique challenges for the processing, storage and transport of biological specimens, due to highly constrained resources, such as very limited conditioned stowage (mass and volume requiring storage in refrigerators or freezers) to keep and return the biospecimens. This subtopic aims to mitigate those space mission constraints by means of innovative approaches for the long duration ambient temperature preservation of human biological samples, particularly blood and urine, while maintaining the integrity of a wide array of biomedically significant molecular markers for subsequent post-mission processing and analysis. This subtopic seeks proposals for novel approaches to preserve analytes of clinical and research interest in human blood and urine samples for a minimum of one year at ambient temperature. Target blood analytes to be preserved include those in the Comprehensive Metabolic Panel: glucose, calcium, albumin, total protein, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride), kidney tests (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine), and liver tests (bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine amino transferase, aspartate amino transferase). Additional blood markers to be preserved include N-telopeptide, sulfate, highly specific C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxy-guanosine, vitamin D, homocysteine, and selenium. For urine samples, the following analytes should be preserved: creatinine, cortisol, N- and C-telopeptides, hydroxyproline, 4-pyridoxic acid, 3-methylhistidine, G-carboxyglutamic acid, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxy-guanosine, uric acid, phosphorus, citrate, sulfate, oxalate, calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and chloride. The proposed technology should be low-resource, low-footprint, and should involve a low volume of supplies/consumables, which do not require refrigeration or freezing for storage. NASA Deliverable: Prototype functional system for long duration room temperature preservation of human blood and/or urine biospecimens, demonstrating integrity for a subset of the target analytes (in Phase I).

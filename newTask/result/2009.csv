Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,"O1.01Coding, Modulation, and Compression", JPL," AFRC, ARC, GRC, GSFC","This subtopic aims to develop innovative technology in three key areas of space communications: modulation, forward error-correction (FEC) coding, and data compression. The objective is to provide the best possible trade-off of coding gain, bandwidth efficiency, complexity (mass or power), and rate-distortion, so that the total science/engineering value can be maximized while using the smallest amount of spacecraft energy possible. This will enable NASA to meet a wide range of requirements for its future space missions at near Earth, lunar, and deep space distances. These future missions will use many link types (direct-to-Earth, TDRS relay, lander-to-orbiter relay, and short-proximity links), frequencies (S-, X-, and Ka-bands), and application-specific performance requirements (latency, complexity). The state-of-the-art in the three areas addressed by this subtopic is summarized here:Modulation: BPSK and QPSK for deep space, and BPSK, QPSK, SQPSK, and 8-PSK for near Earth (TDRS) applications; GMSK for bandwidth efficient applications Coding: CCSDS turbo codes and LDPC codes (See http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/131x0b1.pdf(link is external) and http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/131x1o2e2.pdf(link is external)) Compression: the CCSDS standard (http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/122x0b1c2.pdf(link is external))Technology development is needed in the following areas: Modulation There is a need for the implementation and demonstration of ground receivers and flight receivers that exhibit very low implementation loss for 8-PSK and GMSK (in addition to BPSK, QPSK, and SQPSK) for operation ranges from 8 bps (emergency) through 100 Mbps (high rate Ka-band). Emphasis is placed on minimizing implementation loss ( Phase 1 tasks should target completion of a fixed-point design whose performance can be verified by simulation (in, e.g., Simulink or SPW). Phase 2 technology target is a hardware demonstration at TRL 5. Coding There is a need to interface a receiver as above with a high-performing LDPC decoder. Government licensing of LDPC decoding technology (Verilog source) is available. What is needed here is the development of the following:FPGA simulations of all 10 CCSDS LDPC codes down to a bit error rate of 1e-10 and a codeword error rate of 1e-9, and with a goal of identifying the ""error floor"" of each of the codes. Improved decoding algorithms that reduce the observed error floor. It is known that observed error floors for these codes are a characteristic of standard belief propagation (BP) decoding, and not because of the minimum distance properties of the codes. Variations of standard decoding may not be susceptible to the same trapping sets, thereby improving error floor performance. These methods include (a) optimally decoding the 4-cycles, (b) converting 4-cycles to equivalent trees, (c) BP decoding with damping, and (d) using min in place of min* in the later iterations of the decoder. These and other variations should be tested particularly on the k=1024, r=4/5 code, which is expected to exhibit the highest error floor.The target is a finished product at TRL 5. Data Compression Development of a radiation-tolerant high-speed (over 100 Msamples/sec) lossless compression component conforming to CCSDS 121.0-B-1, ""lossless data compression"" (www.ccsds.org(link is external)) allowing input dynamic range to over 24-bit/sample. Options should include user-supplied external predictor, as well as providing potential applications to hyper-spectral data by taking advantage of the spectral correlation in such data sets. Development to TRL 5 is desired. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward a Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration and deliver a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract. The proposer to this subtopic is advised that the products proposed may be included in a future small satellite flight opportunity. Please see the SMD Topic S4 on Small Satellites for details regarding those opportunities. If the proposer would like to have their proposal considered for flight in the small satellite program, the proposal should state such and recommend a pathway for that possibility.Read less>>"
Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.02Antenna Technology, GRC," AFRC, ARC, GSFC, JPL, JSC, LaRC","NASA seeks advanced antenna systems in the following areas: phased array antennas; ground-based uplink antenna array designs; high-efficiency, miniature antennas; smart, reconfigurable antennas; large aperture inflatable/deployable antennas; antenna adaptive beam correction with pointing control; parallelized numerical solvers for antenna modeling and design; and communication antennas with improved performance. Phased Array Antennas High performance phased array antennas are needed for (1) high-data rate communication and (2) remote sensing applications. The frequencies of interest are P-, L-, C-, S-, X-, Ku-, Ka-, and W-band. Potential communications applications include: lunar and planetary exploration, landers, probes, Lunar Relay Satellites, lunar rovers, lunar habitats, lunar surface EVA, suborbital vehicles, sounding rockets, balloons, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's), TDRSS communication, and expendable launch vehicles (ELV's). Potential remote sensing applications include: radiometers, passive radar interferometer platforms, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) platforms for planetary science. Multi-band phased array technology such as S- and Ka-band phased array antennas, which can dynamically reconfigure active element coupling in order to operate in either band as required in order to maximize flexibility, efficiency and minimize the mass of hardware delivered to the moon for lunar surface system operations, are of interest. The goal is to maximize flexibility and capability to share lunar communications infrastructure and therefore minimize mass of radio components that must to be delivered to the lunar surface. There is also a high interest in developing phased array antennas for space-based range applications to accommodate dynamic maneuvers. The arrays are required to be aerodynamic or conformal in shape for sounding rockets, UAV's, and expendable platforms. They must also be able to withstand the launch environment. The balloon vehicles communicate primarily with TDRS and can tolerate a wide range of mechanical dimensions. The main challenges/tradeoffs to be addressed are achieving low mass, low cost, high power efficiency, thermal stability of active array electronics, and coverage area (i.e., highly steerable arrays). Active arrays with features such as T/R module self-calibration for thermal stability, true time delay (TTD), low-cost highly-integrated MMIC-based T/R modules (e.g., SiGe/GaAs technology), multiple beam-forming capability, low-loss feeds for radiometer applications are also of interest. Advances in digital beam-forming techniques, including those based on superconducting digital signal processing methods, are also desirable. Ground-based Uplink Antenna Array Designs NASA is considering arrays of ground-based antennas to increase capacity and system flexibility, to reduce reliance on large antennas and high operating costs, and eliminate single point of failure of large antennas. A large number of smaller antennas arrayed together results in a scalable, evolvable system which enables a flexible schedule and support for more simultaneous missions. Some concepts currently under consideration are the development of medium-size (12-m class) antennas (hundreds of them are expected to be required) for transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) ground-based arrays. A significant challenge is the implementation of an array for transmitting (uplinking), which may or may not use the same antennas that are used for receiving. The uplink frequency will be in the 7.1-8.6 GHz range (X-band) in the near term, and may be at higher frequencies in the future; it will likely carry digital modulation at rates from 10 kbps to 30 Mbps. An EIRP of at least 500 GW is required, and some applications contemplate an EIRP as high as 10 TW. A major challenge in the uplink array design is minimizing the life-cycle cost of an array. Other challenges for ground-based antennas include the development of low cost, reliable components for critical antenna systems; advanced, ultra-phase-stable electronics, and phase calibration techniques; improved understanding of atmospheric effects on signal coherence; and integrated low-noise receiver-transmitter technology. Phase calibration techniques needed to ensure coherent addition of the signals from individual antennas at the spacecraft are also required. It is important to understand whether space-based techniques are required or if ground-based techniques are adequate. In general, a target spacecraft in deep space cannot be used for calibration because of the long round-trip communication delay. Design of ultra-phase-stable electronics to maintain the relative phase among antennas is also needed. These will minimize the need for continuous, extensive and/or disruptive calibrations. A primary related effort currently underway is understanding the effect of the medium (primarily the Earth's troposphere) on the coherence of the signals at the target spacecraft. Generally, turbulence in the medium tends to disrupt the coherence in a way that is time-dependent and site-dependent. A quantitative understanding of these effects is needed. Consequently, techniques for integrating a very low-noise, cryogenically cooled receiver with a medium power (1-200 W) transmitter, are desired. If transmitters and receivers are combined on the same antenna, the performance of each should be compromised as little as possible, and the low cost and high reliability should be maintained. High-Efficiency, Miniature Antennas High efficiency, low-cost, low-mass, broadband or dual-band miniaturized antennas (UHF or X-band) that radiate circular polarization with full hemispherical coverage are desirable. These antennas must be able to withstand launch and re-entry environments and must be low profile/conformal. The emergence of frequency-agile radios increases emphasis of antenna capable of bidirectional communications across multiple bands. Accordingly, emphasis on small size, high efficiency and low cost of ownership is desirable. Miniaturization of L-, S-, and C- band for Micro Air Vehicles is also of interest. Miniaturized antennas that are wearable or can be highly integrated into the host structure/entity, are also desirable. Examples include EVA's space suits made with textile antennas, fractal antennas, or visor mounted antennas. These miniaturized antennas should also be multi-directional to support astronaut mobility, support multi-band operation, and/or possess a broad bandwidth. Antennas should be low/self-powered, small, and efficient, and compatible with communication equipment that can provide high data rate coverage at short ranges (~1.5 - 3 km, horizon for the Moon for EVA). Smart, Reconfigurable Antennas NASA is interested in smart, reconfigurable antennas for applications in lunar and planetary operations. The characteristics to consider include the frequency, polarization, and the radiation pattern. Low-cost approaches are encouraged to reduce the number of antenna apertures needed to meet the requirements associated with lunar and planetary surface exploration (e.g., rovers, pressurized surface vehicles, habitats, etc.). Desirable features include multi-beam operation to support connectivity to different communication nodes on lunar and planetary surfaces, or in support of communication links for satellite relays around planetary orbits. The antenna shall also be highly directive, multi-frequency and compatible with the Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) concept. Large Aperture Inflatable/Deployable Antennas Large aperture inflatable/deployable membrane antennas to significantly reduce stowage volume (packaging efficiencies as high as 50:1), provide high deployment reliability, and significantly reduced mass density (i.e., Novel materials (including memory matrix materials), low fabrication costs and deployment and construction methods using low emissive materials to enable passive microwave instrument application are also beneficial. Structural health monitoring systems are needed to support pre-flight integration, and test activities to determine in-flight system health, are of interest. The ability to incorporate structural considerations for mission applications is also desired (e.g., aero-braking for deep space planetary missions).Membrane materials for large inflatable membrane antennas for remote sensing applications for earth and planetary science missions are of particular interest to the Science Mission Directorate. The current state of the art for mechanical deployable antennas is reaching limits on packaging efficiencies. Reflectors manufactured from polymer films could enable greater packaging efficiencies due to their low mass, high packaging efficiencies, solar radiation resistance, and cryogenic flexibility. However, most polymer films, including polyimide polymer films, have many challenges that limit their usefulness in practical space applications. Active membrane control system concepts, developed to reduce shape errors, often add unwanted bulk and mass to the antenna system. While other concepts will be entertained, specific membrane material technology innovations of interest are listed below: Polymer membrane (0.5 mil to 2.0 mil) material exhibiting zero or near-zero Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE). Polymer membrane material exhibiting durability to the space environment, including atomic oxygen, VUV, solar particulate radiation, and temperature extremes. Thin film deployment methods that deploy the antenna surface substantially free of wrinkles. Innovative intrinsically electroactive polymer membrane actuation mechanisms that can be used to shape-correct the antenna surface. Additionally, composite materials for large deployable antenna reflector structures for remote sensing applications for earth and planetary science missions with high specific stiffness composite materials that can be packed compactly and deployed multiple times for ground evaluation of the antenna structure prior to launch and deployment in space are of interest. Investigators should consider materials that can be folded and deployed on the order of 5 to 10 times with up to 180 degree bends that retain their structural integrity and shape accuracy upon final deployment. The deployment of these materials should require low energy. Rigidizable materials (Shape Memory Polymers, Shape Memory Composites, UV Activated Composites, etc.) could be considered to obtain the appropriate structural stiffness and post-deployment precision. Prospective proposers are advised to review Subtopic S1.02, Active Microwave Technologies, for additional remote sensing applications needs, and indicate applicability in their proposal(s). Antenna Adaptive Beam Correction with Pointing Control Antenna adaptive beam correction with pointing control that can provide spacecraft knowledge with fine beam pointing with sub-milliradian precision (e.g., Parallelized Numerical Solvers for Antenna Modeling/Design Development of full 3-D electromagnetic (EM) solvers that take advantage of new software engineering approaches (e.g., object oriented programming) and parallel computing resources for fast and accurate modeling/design of antennas, antennas with feed structures, and antennas in multi-path environment are of interest. Numerical solvers offering fast and accurate synthesis via search algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithm) of patch arrays and waveguide slot arrays, to reduce design time, are also of interest. All solvers must aim toward experimental validation of actual antenna concept being simulated. Communication Antennas with Improved Performance High performance, low-cost antennas are needed for a variety of missions for communicating with TDRSS, GPS (L1, L2, and L5 bands), or the Deep Space Network (DSN). The frequency bands of interest are L-, S-, X-, Ku-, and Ka-band. Antenna concepts that offer significant improvement in cost and performance (e.g., mass, gain, efficiency, VSWR, axial ratio, bandwidth, power handling, vibration tolerance, etc.) over existing off-the-shelf antennas would be of interest. Novel isoflux antennas at S- and X-band would also be of interest. Antennas must be able to withstand launch environments. Deliverables and Development Timeline After a possible Phase 3 development activity, these technologies are expected to ready for insertion at TRL 6 by 2015. Therefore a TRL progression from an entry TRL of 1 - 2 for Phase 1 in January 2010 followed by an exit TRL of 3 - 4 after Phase 2 is reasonable. For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract. Phase 1 Deliverables A final report containing optimal design for the technology concept including feasibility of concept and a detailed path towards Phase 2 hardware and/or software demonstration. The report shall also provide options for potential Phase 3 funding from other government agencies (OGA). Phase 2 Deliverables A working proof-of-concept demonstrated and delivered to NASA for testing and verification. Read less>>"
Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.03Reconfigurable/Reprogrammable Communication Systems, GRC," AFRC, ARC, GSFC, JPL, JSC","NASA seeks novel approaches in reconfigurable, reprogrammable transceiver systems for Space Operations, Exploration, Science, and Aeronautics research. Exploration of Lunar and Mars environments will require advancements in radio communication systems to manage the demands of the harsh space environment on space electronics, maintain flexibility and adaptability to changing needs and requirements, and provide flexibility and survivability due to increased mission durations. NASA missions can have vastly different transceiver requirements (e.g., 1's to 10's Mbps at UHF- and S-band frequency bands up to 10's to 1000's Mbps at X- and Ka-band frequency bands.) and available resources depending on the science objective, operating environment, and spacecraft resources. For example, deep space missions are often power constrained; operating over large distances, and subsequently have lower data transmission rates when compared to near-Earth or near planetary satellites. These requirements and resource limitations are known prior to launch; therefore, the scalability feature can be used to maximize transceiver efficiency while minimizing resources consumed. Larger platforms such as vehicles or relay spacecraft may provide more resources but may also be expected to perform more complex functions or support multiple and simultaneous communication links to a diverse set of assets. This solicitation seeks advancements in reconfigurable transceiver and associated component technology. The goal of the subtopic is to provide flexible, reconfigurable communications capability while minimizing on-board resources and cost. Topics of interest include the development of software defined radios or radio subsystems which demonstrate reconfigurability, flexibility, reduced power consumption of digital signal processing systems, increased performance and bandwidth, reduced software qualification cost, and error detection and mitigation technologies. Complex reconfigurable systems will provide multiple channel and multiple and simultaneous waveforms. Areas of interest to develop and/or demonstrate are as follows:Enable advancements in bandwidth capacity, reduced resource consumption, or adherence to the Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) standard and open hardware and software interfaces. Techniques should include fault tolerant, reliable software execution, reprogrammable digital signal processing devices. Reconfigurable software and firmware which provide access control, authentication, and data integrity checks of the reconfiguration process including partial reconfiguration which allows simultaneous operation and upload of new waveforms or functions. Operator or automated reconfiguration or waveform load detection failure and the ability to provide access back to a known, reliable operational state. An automated restore capability ensures the system can revert to a baseline configuration, thereby avoiding permanent communications loss due to an errant reconfiguration process or logic upset. Develop dynamic or distributed on-board processing architectures to provide reconfigurability and processing capacity. For example, demonstrate technologies to enable a common processing system capacity for communications, science, and health monitoring. Adaptive modulation and waveform recognition techniques are desired to enable transceivers to exchange waveforms with other assets automatically or through ground control. Low overhead, low complexity hardware and software architectures to enable hardware or software component or design reuse (e.g., software portability) that demonstrates cost or time savings. Emphasis should be on the application of open standards architecture to facilitate interoperability among different vendors to minimize the operational impact of upgrading hardware and software components. Software tools or tool chain methodologies to enable both design and software modeling and code reuse and advancements in optimized code generation for digital signal processing systems. Use of reconfigurable logic devices in software defined radios is expected to increase in the future to provide reconfigurability and on-orbit flexibility for waveforms and applications. As the densities of these devices continue to increase and feature size decreases, the susceptibility of the electronics to single event effects also increases. Novel approaches to mitigate single event effects in reconfigurable logic caused by charged particles are sought to improve reliability. New methods should show advancements in reduced cost, power consumption or complexity compared to traditional approaches such as voting schemes and scrubbing. Techniques and implementations to provide a core capability within the software defined radio in the event of failure or disruption of the primary waveform and/or system hardware. Communication loss should be detected and core capability (e.g., ""gold"" waveform code) automatically executed to provide access control and restore operation. Innovative solutions to software defined radio implementations that reduce power consumption and mass. Solutions should enable future hardware scalability among different mission classes (e.g., low rate deep space to moderate or high rate near planetary, or relay spacecraft) and should promote modularity and common, open interfaces. In component technology, advancements in analog-to-digital converters or digital-to-analog converters to increase sampling and resolution capabilities, novel techniques to increase memory densities, and advancements in processing and reconfigurable logic technology each reducing power consumption and improving performance in harsh space environments. Development of radio technology that allows the incorporation of Space Network (SN) waveforms and candidate Lunar Surface System (LSS) wideband waveforms such as 802.11 and 802.16 into a single multimode radio capable of supporting simultaneous communications with space and lunar network assets. Development and implementation of direct RF to digital technologies that are currently emerging and can offer significant improvements in the flexibility of software or multi-mode radios. The goal is to maximize flexibility and capability to share lunar communications infrastructure and therefore minimize mass of radio components that must to be delivered to the lunar surface. Small, lightweight all-digital reconfigurable radios and transceivers that eliminate analog front ends that operate across multiple bands, are sought for applications that involve network enhanced telemetry, leading towards adaptive and cognitive radio applications. Application of reconfigurable systems in airborne and terrestrial systems is of interest.Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration and delivering a hardware demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.04Miniaturized Digital EVA Radio, JSC, GRC,"As NASA embarks upon deep space human exploration, the next-generation EVA radio will be a pivotal technology and integral part of lunar surface systems success. It will facilitate surface operations, enable crew mobility, and support point to multi-point communications across rovers, landers, habitat, and other astronauts. Driven by Communications, Command, Control, and Information (C3I) interoperability, tight power budgets, and extreme miniaturization, this mobile radio platform must be power efficient and highly adaptive. With a scant EVA radio power budget of less than four watts, the S-band (2.4 - 2.483 GHz) adaptive radio must deliver voice, telemetry, and high-definition motion imagery transmissions. To surmount interference, the radio must support frequency diversity over the specified S-band spectrum of 2.4 - 2.483 Ghz. During nominal operations, it is designed to operate with a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) so the coverage for communications can be extended indefinitely with node additions. It will communicate to fixed and mobile nodes, including lunar base stations, landers, habitats, rovers, and other astronauts. Therefore, it must support multiple bandwidths, waveforms, and energy profiles. To achieve the overarching communication goals of small form factor, ultra-power, and reconfigurability, NASA needs to extend the state-of-the art in two key areas: Tunable RF Front End and Transceiver The major impetus behind the MEMS technology stems from compactness which leads to lower power dissipation, higher levels of integration, lower weight, volume, and cost. To shrink form factor and enable efficient surface operations, one of the cornerstone radio components of this radio is the tunable filter. Recent advances in RF MEMs filters and resonator technology have permitted very high quality factors (>1000) at GHz frequencies. Achieving high and excellent tuning range (>2:1 ) to bandwidth ratio without cryogenic cooling is now viable for the S-band frequency. For reliability, the tunable filter should employ a contact-less tuning scheme. Also, a new class of MEMS-based frequency synthesizers offers dramatic reduction in noise, power, and form factor. One should leverage emerging microscale resonator technologies to the maximum extent. Low phase noise synthesizers running at ultra low power levels are viable using high Q resonator technologies MEMS resonators-based phase lock loop offers compelling power and noise performance enhancements. Power-Aware Processing To support QoS of different applications, it's not enough to optimize power at design time, but dynamic power management must be employed to ensure power efficiency. To maximum power efficiency, it must be able to adjust power and update rates to suit diverse missions. Users should be able to specify Quality of Service (QoS) for different data streams. The radio must have the capability to scale power, select the optimum mode of operation, and minimum energy profile. During low-rate-processing intensive modes, including local processing and compression of telemetry data and voice, highly energy-efficient low-voltage, low-performance modes must be used. For high-rate-processing intensive modes, like advance signal encoding of high motion imagery, medium performance modes must be used; and during active communication modes (which may have a low duty-cycle), ultra-high-performance modes must be used. Accordingly, the digital platform must be highly agile and use-case aware to continuously minimize energy. Below are the desirable technology features. Bear in mind, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and to show a path towards a hardware and software demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract. Phase 1 Deliverables Conduct design trade analyses between power, performance, and flexibility. Estimate mass, volume, power, max/min range, and data rates for dynamic quality of service- voice, telemetry, video- standard and high definition TV at S-band (2.4 - 2.483 GHz), backed with analyses and simulation to ensure achievable performance and power goals. Develop a promising MEMS-based system-on-chip radio design with the following features: Variation-tolerant, performance-scalable architectures: Hardware must sense its own limitation at a dynamically varying, performance-driven optimal energy operating point, and reconfigure accordingly. If variability is stressed at the low-voltage operating point, redundant hardware should be used to improve reliability; if throughput is stressed at the high-performance operating point, redundant hardware should be used to increase parallelism.Highly agile platform components (SRAM and logic): Circuits should use functionality assists, including selective biasing, leakage-control, routine resources, etc., that get engaged dynamically depending on the operating point.Energy-aware algorithms for adaptive hardware: Algorithms must be aware of the different hardware operating-points and associated architecture. For instance, during low-power modes targeting voice and data (for telemetry), occasional high through-put applications (like high motion imagery) should dynamically switch to algorithms employing extreme parallelism in order to support a minimum operating voltage.Extreme power converters: To minimize off-chip components, DC-DC converters should use a single reconfigurable architecture that efficiently delivers load powers ranging from micro-Watts, at low-voltages, to Watts, at high voltages.High performance ultra-low power ADCs: Exploit novel ADCs with sampling frequencies in tunable multi GHz range (preferable double digits). Variable resolution up to 20 bits or higher with ultra-low power jitters for finer resolutions at higher bits and comparators managed for higher bits with minimum power overheads.A high sampling rate is desirable. SNR optimizations and efficient signal recovery demonstration is a requirement for validating ADC capabilities.Modularity and extensibility: Enabling platform must support open architecture and accommodate rapid upgrades, multiple protocols, new technology advances, complete re-configurability of functionality, and evolution of lunar communications and network infrastructure. One significant prerequisite to Phase 2 is the development of most promising MEMS-based transceiver system-on-chip (SoC) architecture The offeror must demonstrate the ability to achieve significant advantage in compactness and ensure power efficiency and reliability. Phase 2 Deliverables Develop a reliable, intelligent, and power-efficient MEMS-based EVA digital radio prototype unit, demonstrating robust and dynamic power management. The miniaturized radio technology must reach TRL=5 at the end of Phase 2. Demonstrate RF performance and power consumption of less than four watts, delivering voice, telemetry, and standard and high-definition video motion imagery at 2.4 - 2.483 GHz (S-band). With power constraints of under four watts, performance and reliability must be assured for multiple bandwidths and data transmissions of telemetry, voice, and high-rate video. Read less>>"
Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.05Transformational Communications Technology, GRC, JSC,"NASA seeks revolutionary, highly innovative, transformational communications technologies that have the potential to enable order of magnitude performance improvements for space operations, exploration systems, and science mission applications. Research emphasizing both nearer-term and far-term technologies is focused (but not limited to) in the following areas: Near-Term Focus Areas:Develop novel techniques to reduce the size, weight, and power (SWAP) of communications transceivers for space missions. Address SWAP challenges by addressing digital processing and logic implementation tradeoffs, static vs. dynamic power, voltage and frequency scaling, hardware and software partitioning such that operational modes are effectively managed. Great demands will be placed on these communication transceivers to assure crew safety and robustness in harsh deep-space environments for long duration missions. Investigate and demonstrate novel RF communication technologies to alleviate the demanding requirements on analog to digital converters (ADCs) and digital signal processors (DSPs). For software-defined radios, such requirements can result in high ADC power consumption, large form factor, and expensive components, which can pose problems for power and weight constrained deep space missions. Significant component-level technical advances are needed in the area of UHF/VHF filter technologies. Novel, smaller form factor, lower cost, higher performance, and lower weight than existing devices are to be demonstrated employing new technologies such as MEMS resonators (e.g., electrostatic, piezoelectric) and tunable dielectrics. Filter solutions that offer a bandwidth tunability or reconfigurability and filter banks are also sought. Fractional bandwidths of 0.1% to greater than 2% are of interest, where for narrower bandwidths, operating stability across temperature is necessary. At the conclusion of Phase 1, proposers should clearly delineate, through a combination of theoretical analysis and demonstrated prototypes, that the proposed solution can achieve better than 3 dB of insertion loss, better than 70 dB of rejection, less than 1 dB of ripple, small shape factors, power handling greater than +20 dBm, VSWR less than 2, and robust operation in a harsh space environment. Phase 2 will leverage the analysis and prototypes developed in Phase 1 to meet to the specifications for space-based communication links and will deliver a demonstration unit of the proposed technology for testing. Phase 2 will also evaluate component reliability to ensure robust operation across the harsh temperature, vibration, shock, and other conditions encountered in space operation. NASA seeks to integrate RFID, antenna, flexible organic material (e.g., Liquid-crystal polymer with constant dielectric properties from 1-110 GHz) and energy-scavenging technologies to develop ultra-low-cost enhanced range sensor surface nodes. This new generation of conformal wireless nodes based on the utilization of UHF semi-passive RFIDs on beacons and astronaut suits would enable the development of robust communication links through the implementation of very-large-scale ad-hoc networks for rugged and/or emergency response environments. Many technical challenges are associated with the development and enhancement of localization and precise tracking of assets for long-duration missions. To leverage terrain-adaptive navigation solutions, inventory tracking, and astronaut body area network applications, several quantum leap technologies including semi-passive RFID-enabled wearable tags and multi-hopping inflatable beacons need to be advanced to demonstrate ranges in excess of 200 m. Astronauts wearing at least 4 miniaturized ultra-low-power inertial sensors at spacings below the operation wavelength of 2.4GHz (EVA) could enable RFID-enabled inflatable beacons for accurate tracking and navigation. The capability of state-of-the-art wireless systems to provide precise timing/time-tracking with nanosecond accuracy coupled with ultra-low-power wearable inertial sensors and low-power multi-hopping algorithms between beacon-mounted and astronaut-mounted RFIDs can enable true mobility location awareness in ranges in excess of 500/1000 meters. Low power beacons (assuming a duty cycle of 5-10 %) can be solar powered and fabricated in an inflatable triangular shape. It has already been already been proven that some solar-powered ""semi-passive"" RFID's with a single-hop range of 100+m consumes only 80 microwatts and can improved by a factor of 3 to 5. Yet, to have a practical ad-hoc beacon network with effective beacon-to-beacon and beacon-to-RFID ranges in excess of 1 km, with beacon power levels between 20 microwatts to 5 milliwatts, various technical challenges need to be addressed: solar panels should achieve efficiencies greater than 50% and should be easily printed as a substrate of the printed beacon antennas, the electronics should operate in sub-threshold domain, the IC power consumption should be below 20 microwatts, and the antenna should feature at least two different frequencies for redundancy. Solutions should consider employing power scavenging merging dynamic/kinetic energy from the astronaut motion (mounted on boots), solar energy (through thin-films on uniform), thermal/vibration energy (through inkjet-printed nanotube-based wearable textiles), thus minimizing the use of portable battery. Phase 1 effort should introduce an ""ad-hoc"" wearable network of 3-5 RFID-enabled wearable inertial sensors that could provide voice-level communication with inflatable beacons with total power consumption below 500 microwatts. Up to 5 hops with 300m + hop will be investigated for enhanced range wireless links for 433 MHz, 900MHz and integration. The prototype should include 5+ wearable tags and 5+ inflatable beacons and 3 test frequencies. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward a Phase 2 multi-tag, multi-scenario hardware demonstration prototype unit. Far-Term Focus Areas:The promise of high-performance, multi-functional, nanostructured materials has led to intense interest in developing them for applications for human spaceflight and exploration. These materials (notably single wall carbon nanotubes) exhibit extraordinary mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties at the nanoscale and possess exceptionally high surface area. The development of nano-scale communication devices and systems including nano-antennas, nano-transceivers, etc. are of interest for nano-spacecraft applications. Quantum entanglement or innovative breakthroughs in quantum information physics has sparked interest to specifically address this phenomenon and the critical unknowns relevant to revolutionary improvements in communicating data, information or knowledge. Methods or techniques that demonstrate extremely novel means of effectively packaging, storing, encrypting, and/or transferring information are sought. Innovative approaches to use of medium to high frequency (300 KHz-30MHz) bands for applications benefiting future lunar missions. Concepts, studies, development of key technologies are needed to perform non-line-of-sight communication for potential use on the surface of the Moon. Modulation and coding techniques, antennas, solid-state amplifiers, digital baseband circuitry, etc. are required to be developed and/or validated to enable over the horizon communication and communications into craters for robotic and human missions. Range of communications on the order of 10-20 kilometers at a data rate of 128 kbps is envisioned to support many of these types of lunar surface links. Ultra-wideband (UWB) or impulse radio wireless communications, navigation and tracking for lunar applications. UWB has the capability of pervasive wireless transmission of data, video, etc., very fine time resolution, low power spectral density, and resistance to multipath.

Purpose (based on NASA needs) and current state-of-the-art In the future, spacecraft with increasingly capable instruments producing large quantities of data will be visiting the moon and the planets. To support the communication needs of these missions and maximize the data return to Earth, innovative long-range telecommunications technologies that maximize power efficiency, transmitted power density and data rate, while minimizing size, mass and power are required.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.08Lunar Surface Communication Networks and Orbit Access Links, GRC," GSFC, JPL, JSC","This solicitation seeks to develop a highly robust, bidirectional, and disruption-tolerant communications network for the lunar surface and lunar orbital access links. Exploration of lunar and planetary surfaces will require short-range (~1.6 km line-of sight, ~5.6 km non-line-of-sight) bi-directional, often highly asymmetric, and robust multiple-point links to provide on-demand, disruption and delay-tolerant, and autonomous interconnection among surface-based assets. Minimization of communication asset scheduling, and other ground operation support, is highly desirable. Some of the nodes will be fixed, such as base stations and relays to orbital assets, and some transportable, such as rovers and humans. The ability to meet the demanding environment presented by lunar and planetary surfaces will encompass the development and integration of a number of communication and networking technologies and protocols. NASA lunar surface networks will be dynamic in nature, and required to deliver multiple data flows with different priorities (operational voice, command/control, telemetry, various qualities of video flows, and others). Bandwidth and power efficient approaches to mobile ad hoc networks are desired. Quality of Service (QoS) algorithms in a Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) setting will need to be developed and tailored to NASA mission specific needs and for the lunar surface environment. Exploitation of delay/disruption tolerant network (DTN) technology to maximize autonomy of the communication infrastructure and to minimize demands on channel capacity is of significant interest. Advantages and disadvantages associated with parallel DTN and IP networks, and a competing DTN-over-IP network architecture, should be considered. Possible associated considerations include routing, security, and QoS. These lunar and planetary surface networks will need to seamlessly interface with communications access terminals and orbiting relays that also can provide autonomous connectivity to Earth based assets. The access link communications system will encompass the development and integration of a number of communications and networking technologies and protocols to meet the stringent demands of continuous interoperable communications. Human exploration, therefore, requires the development of innovative communication protocols that exploit persistent storage on mobile and stationary nodes to ensure timely and reliable delivery of data even when no stable end-to-end paths exist. Solutions must exploit stability when it exists to nearly approximate the performance of conventional MANET protocols. The capability of the network to provide infrastructure-based position determination and navigation is of interest to NASA, especially when coverage issues arise and/or orbiter access links are unavailable. The extent to which the network can support localization of mobile nodes should be addressed, and network architecture options that could further support navigation should be identified. Frequency bands of interest are UHF (401 - 402 MHz, 25 kHz bandwidth), S-band (2.4 - 2.483 GHz), and Ka-band (22.55 - 23.55 GHz). Existing commercial standards for the PHY and MAC layers should be leveraged to the extent possible while meeting other requirements, with modifications considered when necessary. Results from NASA's Lunar Architecture Team, as well as technology trade studies performed for NASA's Constellation Systems, should be referenced for input regarding data flows, coverage, network requirements, etc. EVA study results can be found at: EVA Technology Development path loss study: http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2007/TM-2007-214825.pdf Specific Subtopic Capabilities to Address This Year This year's call intends to focus innovations in 4 key areas. Participants should focus their proposed innovation in one or more of these key areas: Differentiated services and QoS support in dynamic wireless networks when safety-of-life and data flows critical to the mission are traversing the network. DTN prototype protocol development and demonstration in an emulated operational network. Secure data transfers over mobile, dynamic wireless networks with potential interferers and/or interceptors. Position determination and navigation based novel uses of the network infrastructure (e.g. utilizing radiometric information from the network signaling). Proposal should address the following: Network traffic models Network architecture (both hardware and software) Spectrum usage Security plan (if the proposal deals with particular innovations in this area) Identification of software and/or hardware technologies common to networking components that will have the largest impact on size, weight, and power reduction while not compromising the goals of the network architecture as listed above. Phase 1 Deliverables A trade analysis identifying novel software and/or hardware technologies common to networking components that will have the largest impact on size, weight, and power reduction while not compromising the goals of the network architecture is the most important aspect of the Phase 1 deliverable. It is not reasonable to expect that all issues and technologies concerning the network architecture proposed will be developed under a Phase 2 contract. However, the proposer should identify and rank novel hardware/software components based on size/weight/power reduction that will enable the proposed network architecture. The proposer should also identify how they are uniquely qualified to develop the novel technologies to products beneficial to NASA, DoD, and perhaps commercial interests. The Phase 1 proposal should clearly state the assumptions, proposed network architecture, and innovations regarding the 4 key areas mentioned above. Phase 2 Deliverables The novel software and/or hardware component identified in Phase 1 will be developed to a state in which it may be demonstrated and the feasibility of the approach on an actual platform may be quantitatively evaluated by NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.09Software for Space Communications Infrastructure Operations, JPL," GRC, GSFC","New technology is sought to improve resource optimization and the user interface of planning and scheduling tools for NASA's Space Communications Infrastructure. The software created should have a commercialization approach with the new modules fitting into an existing or in development planning and scheduling tool. Purpose (based on NASA needs) and the current state of the art: The current infrastructure for NASA Space Communications provides services for near-Earth spacecraft and deep space planetary missions. The infrastructure assets include the Deep Space Network (DSN), the Ground Network (GN), and the Space Network (SN). Recent planning for the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) for human exploration to the Moon and beyond as well as maintaining vibrant space and Earth science programs resulted in a new concept of the communications architecture. The future communications architecture will evolve from the present legacy assets and with addition of new assets. NASA seeks automation technologies that will facilitate scheduling of oversubscribed communications resources to support: (1) Increased numbers of missions and customers; (2) Increased number and complexity of constraints (as required by new antenna types); and (3) decreased operations budgets (both core communications network operations and mission side operations budgets. Core Capabilities: Intelligent Assistants In order to automate the user's provision of requirements and refinement of the schedule, ""intelligent assistant"" software should manage the user interface. Assistants should streamline access and modification of requirement and schedule information. By modeling the user, this software can adjust the level of autonomy enabling decisions to be made by the user or the automated system. Assistants should try to minimize user involvement without making decisions the user would prefer to make. The assistants should adapt to the user by learning their control preferences. This technology should apply to local/centralized and collaborative scheduling. In a conflict-aware scheduling system (especially in a collaborative scheduling environment), conflicts are prevalent. With the concept of one big schedule from the beginning of time, real time, to the end of time, resolving conflicts become a difficult task especially since resolving conflicts in a local sense may affect the global schedule. Therefore, an intelligent assistant may provide decision support to the system or the users to assist conflict resolution. This may involve a set of rules combining with certain local/global optimization to generate a list of options for the system or users to choose from. Resource Optimization The goal of schedule optimization is to produce allocations that yield the best objectives. These may include maximizing DSN utilization, minimizing loss of desired tracking time, and optimizing project satisfaction. Each project may have their own definition of satisfaction such as maximal science data returned, maximal tracking time, best allocation of the day/week, etc. The difficulty is that we may not satisfy all of these objectives during the optimization process. Obviously, optimal solution for one objective may produce worse results for the other objectives. One possible solution is to map all of these objectives to an overall system goal. This mapping is normally non-linear. Technology needs to be developed for this non-linear mapping for scoring in addition to regular optimization approaches. Optional Capabilities: Multiple Agents In an environment where all system variables can be controlled by a single controller, an optimal solution for the objective function can be achieved by finding the right set of variables. In a collaborative environment with multiple decision makers where each decision maker can only control a subset of the variables, modeling and optimization become a very complex issue. In the proposed collaborative scheduling approach, there are many users/agents that will control their own allocations with interaction with the others. How we model their interactions and define system policy so the interaction can achieve the overall system goal is an important topic. The approach for multiple decision-maker collaboration has been studied in the area of Game Theory. The applications cover many areas including economics and engineering. The major solutions include Pareto, Nash, and Stackelberg. There are many new research areas including incentive control, collaborative control, Ordinal Games, etc. Note that intelligent assistants and multiple agents represent different points on the spectrum of automation. Current operations utilize primarily manual collaborative scheduling, intelligent assistants would enhance users ability to participate in this process and intelligent agents could more automate individual customers scheduling. Ideally, proposed intelligent assistants and distributed agents would also be able to represent customers who do not wish to expose their general preferences and constraints.

Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward a Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract. Phase 1 Deliverables Propose demonstration of Intelligent Assistants, Resource Optimization, or Multiple Agents on a number of communication asset allocation problem sets (involving dozens of missions, communications assets, and operational constraints). End Phase deliverable would include a detailed rationale for ROI in usage of said technology to communications asset allocation based on knowledge of current and future operations flows.

Space Operations,Topic O2 Space Transportation ,"O2.01Automated Collection and Transfer of Launch Range Data (Surveillance/Intrusion, Weather)", KSC," GRC, GSFC","NASA is seeking innovative technologies for sensors and instrumentation technologies which expedite range clearance by providing real-time situational awareness for safe Range operations from processing to launch and recovery. These sensors and instruments are expected to operate, as a payload, on mobile or deployable Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), High Altitude Airships (HAA), buoys, etc. NASA is also seeking innovative technologies to remotely measure electric fields aloft in order to reduce the threat of destruction of a launch vehicle by rocket triggered lightning. Purpose: NASA is embarking on a new era of space exploration with new launch vehicles and demands for availability to support launch times within hours of one another to ensure mission success. This availability requirement is allocated across the entire launch operations which includes the Range that provides clear corridor of land, air and sea for the vehicles to transit through, as they ascent or return. The current Range infrastructure is aging, labor intensive and independent, and would benefit from new sensors and instrumentation that improve the situational awareness (including weather) of those that are responsible for ensuring public safety, mission assurance and efficient operations. To aid in this situational awareness the new sensors and instrumentation must be able to operate in the environment that takes advantage of mobile or deployable Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), High Altitude Airships (HAA), buoys, etc. Use of these vehicles as a platform is intended to increase the Ranges availability while reducing the cost of operations. Size, power, weight and stability of these systems, that operate on these platforms, will be a major constraint their use. These sensors and instrumentation provide for the remote detection, recognition, and identification of persons and objects that have intruded into areas of the range that must be cleared in order to conduct safe launch operations. This would include a wide spectrum of optical, infrared, Radio Frequency (RF), and millimeter wave sensors for this purpose. In order to achieve accurate identification, time and position of intruding entities multiple sensors and instruments may be used, or combined through the use of neural networks and data fusion techniques. This will require the use of standards for communications, so that, data from individual sensors or instruments can be combined on a platform and processed on-board, or communicated to central location where a fused solution is processed. The sensors, instrumentation and algorithms to remotely measure electric fields aloft will reduce the threat of destruction of launch vehicles during ascent by improving the prediction of potential lightning strikes to vehicles due to triggered lightning. Potential candidate technologies include new algorithms to take advantage of existing dual-polarized Doppler five-cm weather radar capability, or entirely new technologies for the remote sensing of electric fields. The ability to economically measure the incremental ballistic wind velocities along the predicted trajectory of launch vehicles at remote and evolving launch ranges at altitudes up to 100 kft via fixed and mobile LIDAR approaches is also highly desirable. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward a Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract.

Space Operations,Topic O2 Space Transportation ,O2.02Ground Test Facility Technologies, SSC," GRC, MSFC","NASA's Stennis Space Center (SSC) is interested with expanding its suite of test facility modeling tools as well as non-intrusive plume technologies that provide information on propulsion system health, the environments produced by the plumes and the effects of plumes and constituents on facilities and the environment. Facility Modeling Tools and Methods Developing and verifying test facilities is complex and expensive. The wide range of pressures, flow rates, and temperatures necessary for engine testing results in complex relationships and dynamics. It is not realistic to physically test each component and the component-to-component interaction in all states before designing a system. Currently, systems must be tuned after fabrication, requiring extensive testing and verification. Tools using computational methods to accurately model and predict system performance are required that integrate simple interfaces with detailed design and/or analysis software. SSC is interested in improving capabilities and methods to accurately predict dynamic responses for transient fluid structure interactions, convective, conductive, and radiant heat transfer for propellant systems, exhaust systems and other components used in rocket propulsion testing. Also of interest is the modeling and prediction of condensation, diffusion, stratification, and concentration gradients for fluid mixtures commonly encountered in testing, such as propellants and purges. Vacuum System Technologies Stennis is constructing the new A3 test stand which is designed to test a very large (294,000 lbf thrust) cryogenic rocket engine at a simulated altitude of 100,000 feet. When the air in the engine test chamber is evacuated, the simulated altitude pressures inside the test chamber will be less than 0.20 PSIA. This will result in a very unique environment with extremely low pressures inside a very large chamber and ambient pressures outside this chamber. Due to the unique nature of this test facility, new technologies and measurement techniques will need to be developed to monitor and analyze this environment. These include but are not limited to instrument closeouts at vacuum pressures for hundreds of channels of instrumentation entering the chamber, new sealing technologies for large cryogenic piping entering this very large test cell wall to seal against this unique environment, material fatigue measurement and predictions, inspection techniques for the vacuum chamber structures and diffuser ducting, etc. Component Design, Prediction and Modeling Improved capabilities to predict and model the behavior of components (valves, check valves, chokes, etc.) during the facility design process are needed. This capability is required for modeling components in high pressure (to 12,000 psi), with flow rates up to several thousand lb/sec, in cryogenic environments and must address two-phase flows. Challenges include: accurate, efficient, thermodynamic state models; cavitation models for propellant tanks, valve flows, and run lines; reduction in solution time; improved stability; acoustic interactions; fluid-structure interactions in internal flows. Plume Environments Measurements Advanced instrumentation and sensors to monitor the near field and far field effects and products of exhaust plumes. Examples are the levels of acoustic energy and thermal radiation and their interaction/coupling with test articles and facilities and measurements of the final exhaust species that will affect the environment. Major challenge: Large scale engine plume dispersion modeling and validation. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward a Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract.

Space Operations,Topic O3 Processing and Operations ,O3.01Human Interface Systems and Technologies, GRC," ARC, GSFC","The focus of this sub topic is on the development of systems and technologies that advance TRL of man/machine interfaces for humans in space environments. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to, high fidelity inbound and outbound speech and audio systems along with data entry/data presentation devices, cameras, metabolic monitoring, health monitoring devices, interfaces that support human/robot interaction, high-level communications protocols and/or standardized interfaces for transmitting and receiving data related to human monitoring systems or human interface systems. Technologies and systems should resolve issues that are peculiar to human/machine interaction in the space environments or exploit unique features of the space environment or both. Interest exists for application to micro-gravity space suits, planetary space suits as well as space-based ""shirtsleeve environments"" such as onboard the ISS, shuttle or other crew modules. The particular focus area of the topic this year is on Advanced Data Entry systems. Advanced Data Entry Terrestrial user-interface devices for controlling portable processing equipment such as laptop computers typically rely on keyboard or touchpad input. Such devices are problematic in the space environment since a suited crewmember must interact with the processing equipment while wearing a pressurized glove. Speech recognition technologies have been proposed and investigated to provide a data entry capability for suited crewmembers. However, speech recognition technologies typically incur a high computational loading burden. Alternative methods and technologies for data entry are anticipated to result in significantly lower processing burden and therefore reduced Size Weight and Power (SWaP) and enhanced system reliability. Preference will be given to proposals that indicate the resulting system will have a low computational burden. Currently, the main purpose of a suit's processing system is for providing life-support data-acquisition, monitoring, telemetry, and crewmember alerts. The traditional approach to interact with the EVA processing system is with suit-mounted toggle switches optimally sized for a gloved hand and located in the suit's chest area. NASA envisions future generations of suits to contain advanced communication, navigation, and information processing capabilities that will require better ways of interacting with the suited crewmember. It is likely that the processing unit(s) will be installed within the suit's backpack-mounted portable life support unit or in close proximity. Crewmember usability and efficient operation are prime features of the next-generation input device. The device must operate robustly in the space environment and on the surface of remote planetary bodies. Devices must be tolerant of dust, vacuum, and radiation exposure. During Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA), a suited crewmember needs to achieve as high a level of mobility as possible, so a suit-mounted computer-input device must not impede the movements of the suited crewmember or unduly burden the suit system with weight, volume, or electrical power constraints. NASA is seeking systems, subsystems and/or technologies in support of improvements in suit-mounted computer system data entry user-interface devices. Devices or systems should allow the suited crewmember to control a computer processing system and provide text input and/or spatial indication accurately, at high speed, without little or no user fatigue. Possible interactions for data entry include, but are not limited to: inputting direction or positions (for navigation or robotic-aid purposes), inserting notes (e.g., field or experiment notes, images, labeling of images), and selecting/marking items on lists (e.g., zooming, drilling down lists, scrolling through lists, moving items). Concepts may consider that provide solutions installed internally (within the pure-oxygen pressurized envelop of the suit), externally (mounted on the exterior of the suit), or a combination of the two: Particular interest is in the areas of: Human interface devices that support manual control of mechanical devices such as rovers or tools; Chording keyboards, suit or glove mounted fabric keyboards or touch-pads; Techniques for routing wires or connections between the user interface device and the computer-processing unit; Techniques for routing the wires past bearings or avoidance of such. Other technologies will be considered. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward a Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration and delivering a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract.

Current utilization of ISS is limited by upmass, downmass, crew time and by the capabilities of the interfaces and hardware already developed. Innovative ways of interfacing existing hardware such as being able to use the light microscopy module (LMM) in the Fluids Integrated Rack (FIR) as a life science microscope could increase biotechnology research capabilities. Enabling additional cell and molecular biology culture techniques by providing innovative hardware to allow for safe, contained transfer of cells from container to container within the Microgravity Sciences Glove Box (MSG) would permit new types of studies on ISS. On orbit analysis techniques that would reduce or remove the need for downmass (such as a system for gene array tests, or kits for DNA extractions for long term storage) are also examples of hardware possibilities that would extend and enable additional research. Capabilities that extend the types of studies that can be completed in orbit are not limited to the above examples or to biotechnology disciplines.

While the definition of ""precise"" depends upon the mission context, typical scenarios have required meter-level or better position accuracies, and sub-millimeter-level or better velocity accuracies. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1, and show a path toward a Phase 2 hardware and/or software demonstration of a demonstration unit or software package that will be delivered to NASA for testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract. The Small Spacecraft Build effort highlighted in Topic S4 (Low-cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies) of the solicitation participates in this subtopic. Offerors are encouraged to take this in consideration as a possible flight opportunity when proposing work to this subtopic. Purpose: NASA Needs vs. Current State of the Art This solicitation is primarily focused on NASA's needs in three focused areas: onboard near-Earth navigation systems; onboard deep-space navigation systems; technologies supporting improved TDRSS-based navigation. Proposals that leverage state-of-the-art capabilities already developed by NASA such as GEONS (http://techtransfer.gsfc.nasa.gov/ft-tech-GEONS.html), Navigator (http://techtransfer.gsfc.nasa.gov/ft-tech-GPS-NAVIGATOR.html), GIPSY, Electra, and Blackjack are especially encouraged. NASA is not interested in funding efforts that seek to ""re-invent the wheel"" by duplicating the many investments that NASA and others have already made in establishing the current state-of-the-art. General Operational Specifications and Requirements: Core Capabilities: Onboard Near-Earth Navigation System NASA seeks proposals that would develop a commercially viable transceiver with embedded orbit determination software that would provide enhanced accuracy and integrity for autonomous onboard GPS- and TDRSS-based navigation and time-transfer in near-Earth space via augmentation messages broadcast by TDRSS. The augmentation message should include information on the TDRS orbits, status, and health that could be provided by future TDRS, and should provide information on the GPS constellation that is based on NASA's TDRSS Augmentation for Satellites Signal (TASS). Proposers are advised that NASA's GEONS and GIPSY orbit determination software packages already support the capability to ingest TASS messages. Onboard Deep-Space Navigation System NASA seeks proposals that would develop an onboard autonomous navigation and time-transfer system that can reduce DSN tracking requirements. Such systems should provide accuracy comparable to delta differenced one-way ranging (DDOR) solutions anywhere in the inner solar system, and exceed DDOR solution accuracy beyond the orbit of Jupiter. Proposers are advised that NASA's GEONS and DS-1 navigation software packages already support the capability to ingest many one-way forward Doppler, optical sensor observation, and accelerometer data types. Technologies Supporting Improved TDRSS-based Navigation NASA seeks proposals that would provide improvements in TDRS orbit knowledge, TDRSS radiometric tracking, ground-based orbit determination, and Ground Terminal improvements that improve navigation accuracy for TDRS users. Methods for improving TDRS orbit knowledge should exploit the possible future availability of accelerometer data collected onboard future TDRS. Optional Capabilities: NASA may consider other proposals relevant to NASA's needs for precise spacecraft navigation and tracking that demonstrably advance the state-of-the-art. Development Timeline Associated with NASA Needs: Phase 1 deliverables should include documentation of technical feasibility, which should at minimum show a path toward hardware and/or software demonstration of a demonstration unit or software package in Phase 2. Phase 2 deliverables should include a demonstration unit or software. The proposer to this subtopic is advised that the products proposed may be included in a future small satellite flight opportunity.

Space Operations,Topic O4 Navigation ,O4.03Lunar Surface Navigation, GRC," GSFC, JPL, JSC","In order to provide location awareness, precision position fixing, best heading and traverse path planning for planetary EVA, manned rovers and lunar surface mobility units NASA has established requirements for onboard navigation capabilities for surface-mobile elements of lunar missions. Proposals are specifically sought which address the following needs:Asset localization within a work area. Specifically, real-time relative location of vehicles and EVA crewmembers for safety and task efficiency. EVA crew localization for emergency walk back to a safe haven (lander, habitat, fixed reference point, etc.) Fixed asset localization with respect to global coordinates. Traverse-path planning systems and navigation-specific displays are also of interest. Novel navigation techniques that utilize repurposed flight vehicle sensors (INS, AHRS, low light imager, star trackers, etc.)This topic will develop systems, technologies and analysis in support of the required capabilities of lunar surface mobility elements. Contemplated navigation systems could employ celestial references, passive or active optical information such as optical flow or range to local terrain features, inertial sensor information or other location-specific sensed data or combinations thereof. However, radiometric measurements are considered to be concomitant to the lunar communications network and the lunar network will likely be used to communicate state information between lunar mission elements. As such, the main emphasis of this topic is on systems that exploit radiometric measurements such as range, Doppler or Angle of Arrival. Radiometric measurements can be considered between lunar mission elements such as surface mobility units, elements of a lunar surface architecture (such as surface landers or habitation units or other surface mobility units) or elements of the lunar communications and navigation infrastructure such as surface communications towers or lunar communication/navigation orbiters. Note that the constellation of moon-orbiting communication/navigation satellites will support both polar outpost missions as well as short term sortie missions that can occur anywhere on the lunar surface. This constellation will likely consist of no more than six satellites and may be only be one or two satellites. Earth-based nodes are not excluded from consideration, nor are two-way radiometric measurements, nor are non-NASA-standard modulation schemes. Emphasis of the development is on navigation accuracy, position estimate update rate (minimized correlation time), minimum Size Weight and Power (SWaP), systems that operate effectively with minimal communications/navigation infrastructure (such as towers or orbiters) or with complete autonomy, with minimal crew involvement or completely automatically. Unified concepts and systems that provide a range of hardware capabilities (possibly trading accuracy with SWaP) and/or support dual-use (e.g., navigation and communication) are of interest. Mature system concepts and technologies including system demonstration with TRL 6 components and internalized (by NASA) standards are required at the end of a Phase 2. Candidates for technology infusion include developmental EVA space suits and prototype crew and robotic rovers. An example rover system is the Lunar Electric Rover (LER). The LER (http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/home/LER.html) is a sport utility sized, 12-wheeled, pressurized vehicle capable of supporting 14-day missions with two astronauts. Recent tests have included 140km treks across rugged terrain in Arizona. Future testing will extend the distance. Examples of a developmental EVA space suit include the Mark iii spacesuit and the REI suit (c.f. http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20080012574_2008010837.pdf). Demonstration opportunities occur several times a year at lunar analog exercises such as the Desert Research and Technology Studies (D-RATS, c.f. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Research_and_Technology_Studies(link is external)) and the Haughton Field test (c.f. http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/projects/haughton_field/).

Space Operations,Topic O4 Navigation ,O4.05Space-Based Range Technologies, GSFC," AFRC, GRC","The vision of Space-Based Range architecture is to assure public safety, reduce the costs of launch operations, enable multiple simultaneous launch operations, decrease response time, and improve geographic and temporal flexibility. This sub-topic seeks to reduce or eliminate the need for redundant range assets and deployed down-range assets that are currently used to provide for Line-of-Sight (LOS) Tracking Telemetry and Control (TT&C) with sub-orbital platforms and orbit-insertion launch vehicles. In order to achieve this, specific advancements are needed in TT&C. Position, Attitude, and Inertial Metrics Realization of a Space-Based Range requires the development of highly accurate and stable integrated metric tracking and inertial measurement units. The focus is on technologies that enable and advance development of low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP), tactical grade, integrated metric tracking units that provide highly accurate and stable positioning, attitude, and inertial measurements on high dynamic platforms. Factors to address include:Easy coupling of IMUs, gyros, accelerometers, and/or attitude determining GPS receivers that will provide very high frequency integrated metric solutions; The ability to reliably function on spin-stabilized rockets (up to 7 rps), during sudden jerk and acceleration maneuvers, and in high vibration environments is critical; Advancements in MEMs-based IMUs and accelerometers, algorithm techniques and Kalman filtering, phased-based attitude determination, single aperture systems, quick Time to First Fix and reacquisition. Space-Based Telemetry There are varying applications for space-based transceivers, each necessitating a different set of requirements. The desired focus is very low SWaP, tactical grade, highly reliable, and easily reconfigurable transceivers capable of establishing and maintaining unbroken satellite communication links for telemetry and/or control. This technology will serve applications which include low-cost sub-orbital missions, secondary communications systems for orbit insertion vehicles, low cost and size orbital payloads (typically LEO), and flight test articles. Durations will range from minutes to several weeks and the ability to operate on highly dynamic platforms is critical. High data rate links are highly desired, thus the use of NASA's TDRSS is emphasized, although other commercial satellite systems which can provide nearly global and high data rate links can also be explored. Factors to address include:Advancements in software based radios and coding techniques; Use of the latest semiconductor technologies (GaN or other); Advanced heat dissipation techniques (to allow small packaging and long duration operating times); Immunity to corona breakdown; Ease of data interfacing.RF power output requirements range from a few watts to as high as 100 W. Special consideration should be given to transceiver capability vs. packaging that would allow for customizable configurations depending on the target application. That is, a modular or stacking design with a common bus architecture should be considered where the RF and digital sections are separated. This could allow for a base digital and DC power design that will support multiple RF slices (such as a low, medium, or high power slice). Also, to satisfy missions who require unidirectional communications, a modular design could allow for separate transmitter and receiver modules/slices. Phase 1 Deliverables A final report containing optimal design for the technology concept including feasibility of concept, a detailed path towards Phase 2 hardware and/or software demonstration. The report shall also provide options for potential Phase 2 funding from other government agencies (OGA).

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.01Mitigation of Aircraft Aging and Durability-Related Hazards, GRC," ARC, LaRC","The mitigation and management of aging and durability-related hazards in future civilian and military aircraft will require advanced materials, concepts, and techniques. NASA is engaged in the research of materials (metals, ceramics, and composites) and characterization/validation test techniques to mitigate aging and durability issues and to enable advanced material suitability and concepts. Proposals are sought for the development of moisture-resistant resins and new surface treatments/primers. Novel chemistries are sought to improve the durability of aerospace adhesives with potential use on subsonic aircraft. This research opportunity is focused on the development of novel chemistries for coupling agents, surface treatments for adherends and their interfaces, leading to aerospace structural adhesives with improved durability. Work may involve chemical modification and testing of adhesives, coupling agents, surface treatments or combinations thereof and modeling to predict behavior and guide the synthetic approaches.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.02Sensing and Diagnostic Capability for Aircraft Aging and Damage, LaRC," AFRC, ARC, GRC, MSFC","Many conventional nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques have been used for flaw detection, but have shown little potential for much broader application. One element in NASA's contribution to solving the problem of aging and damage processes in future vehicles is research to identify changes in fundamental material properties as indicators of material aging-related hazards before they become critical. Degraded and failing fiber composites can exhibit a number of micromechanisms such as fiber buckling and breakage, matrix cracking, and delamination. Methodologies are being sought that allow engineers, using advanced modeling tools to predict the remaining useful life of components, the ability to make use of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) data more effectively. One proposed methodology would be an automated means of processing NDE data to extract defect characteristics (i.e. crack length and depth, or delamination size and location) and map these directly to a computer aided drafting model of the component being inspected. This model (which now contains defect information) could then be used by engineers to perform structural analysis on the component. A successful proposal should demonstrate the performance of the methodology proposed by using the data from at least one conventional NDE technique (i.e. Thermography, Ultrasonics, etc.) and a standard CAD drawing file format. Additionally, actual NDE technologies are also being sought for the nondestructive characterization of age-related degradation in complex composite materials. Innovative and novel approaches to using NDE technologies to measure properties related to material aging (i.e. thermal diffusivity, elastic constants, density, microcrack formation, fiber buckling and breakage, etc.) in complex composite material systems, adhesively bonded/built-up and/or polymer-matrix composite sandwich structures. The anticipated outcome of successful proposals would be a both Phase 2 prototype NDE technology for the use of the developed technique to characterize age-related degradation and a demonstration of the technology showing its ability to measure a relevant material property in a carbon fiber/epoxy composite used for structural applications on subsonic aircraft.

To support this predictive capability, structural integrity analytical tools, lifing methods, and material durability prediction tools are being developed. Physics-based and continuum-based models encapsulated as computational methods (software) are needed to provide the basis for these higher level (e.g., design) tools. Proposals are sought that apply innovative computational methods, models and analytic tools to the following specific applications:Probabilistic computational code is sought for improved structural analysis of complex metallic and composite airframe components. The methods used in these solutions need to detail the initiation and progression of damage to determine accurate estimates of residual life and/or strength of complex airframe structures. Software tools are needed to predict the onset and rates of type-II hot corrosion attack in nickel-based turbine disk superalloys that allow for prolonged disk operation at high temperatures. Typically hot corrosion of turbine alloys is a product of molten salt exposure and is manifested by a localized pitting corrosion attack. Prolonged high temperature exposures of turbine disk alloys to sulfur-rich low temperature melting eutectic salts can lead to an onset of Type II hot corrosion attack causing serious degradation to the durability of the turbine components. Computational software is sought to simulate of the response of advanced composite fan case/containment structures in aged conditions to jet engine fan blade-out events using impact mechanics and structural system dynamics modeling techniques.The anticipated outcome of successful Phase 2 proposals would be analytic code (software) delivered to NASA suitable for use in material evaluation studies.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.04Aviation External Hazard Sensor Technologies, LaRC," AFRC, GRC","NASA is concerned with new and innovative methods for detection, identification, evaluation, and monitoring of in-flight hazards to aviation. NASA seeks to foster research and development that leads to innovative new technologies and methods, or significant improvements in existing technologies, for in-flight hazard avoidance and mitigation. Technologies may take the form of tools, models, techniques, procedures, substantiated guidelines, prototypes, and devices. A key objective of the NASA Aviation Safety Program is to support the research of technology, systems, and methods that will facilitate transformation of the National Airspace System to Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) (information available at www.jpdo.gov(link is external)). The general approach to the development of airborne sensors for NextGen is to encourage the development of multi-use, adaptable, and affordable sensors. The greatest impact will result from improved sensing capability in the terminal area, where higher density and more reliable operations are required for NextGen. Under this subtopic, proposals are invited that explore new and improved sensors and sensor systems for the detection and monitoring of hazards to aircraft. This subtopic solicits technology that is focused on developing capabilities to detect and evaluate hazards. The development of human interfaces, including displays and alerts, is not within the scope of this subtopic except where explicitly requested in association with special topics. Primary emphasis is on airborne applications, but in some cases the development of ground-based sensor technology may be supported. Approaches that use multiple sensors, such as new sensor technologies in conjunction with existing X-band airborne radar, to improve hazard detection and quantification of hazard levels are of interest. At this time, the following hazards are of particular interest: in-flight icing conditions, wake vortices, and turbulence. Proposals associated with sensor investigations addressing these hazards are encouraged, and some suggestions follow. Emphasis on vortices and icing is not intended to discourage proposals targeting other or additional hazards such as reduced visibility, terrain, airborne or ground obstacles, convective weather, gust fronts, cross winds, and wind shear. To enable remote detection and classification of in-flight icing hazards for the future airspace system and emerging aircraft, NASA is soliciting proposals for the development of sensor systems for the detection of icing conditions. Examples include the following practical remote sensing systems:Low-cost, ground-based, vertical-pointing with potential scanning capability X-band radar that can operate unattended around the clock (24/7/365) and provide calibrated reflectivity and velocity data with hydrometer/cloud particle classification (based upon the reflectivity and velocity data). Low-cost, high-frequency (> 89 GHz) microwave or infrared radiometer technology capable of providing air temperature, water vapor, and liquid water measurements for both ground-based and airborne applications.Wake vortex detection in the terminal area is of particular interest, because closer spacing between aircraft is necessary to facilitate the high-density operations expected in NextGen. Airborne detection of wake vortices is considered challenging due to the fact that detection must be possible in nearly all weather conditions, in order to be practical, and because of the size and nature of the phenomena. Proposals are encouraged for the development of novel coherent and direct detection lidar systems and associated components that allow accurate meteorological wind and aerosol measurements suitable for wake vortex characterization. Proposed techniques shall provide range-resolved clear air wind and aerosol measurements in the near-IR wavelength region from 1.5 microns to 2.1 microns. Wind and aerosol measurement with NASA has made a major investment in the development of new and enhanced technologies to enable detection of turbulence to improve aviation safety. Progress has been made in efforts to quantify hazard levels from convectively induced turbulence events and to make these quantitative assessments available to civil and commercial aviation. NASA is interested in expanding these prior efforts to take advantage of the newly developing turbulence monitoring technologies, particularly those focused on clear air turbulence (CAT). NASA welcomes proposals that explore the methods, algorithms and quantitative assessment of turbulence for the purpose of increasing aviation safety and augmenting currently available data in support of NextGen operations.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.07Adaptive Aeroservoelastic Suppression, AFRC," ARC, LaRC","NASA has initiated an Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control (IRAC) effort under the Aviation Safety Program. The main focus of the effort is to advance the state-of-the-art technology in adaptive controls to provide a design option that allows for increased resiliency to failures, damage, and upset conditions. These adaptive flight control systems will automatically adjust the control feedback and command paths to regain stability, maneuverability, and eventually a safe landing. One potential consequence of changing the control feedback and command paths is that an undesired aeroservoelastic (ASE) interaction could occur. The resulting limit cycle oscillation could result in structural damage or potentially total loss of vehicle control. Current airplanes with non-adaptive control laws usually include roll-off or notch filters to avoid ASE interactions. These structural mode suppression filters are designed to provide 8 dB of gain attenuation at the structural mode frequency. Ground Vibration Testing (GVT), Structural Mode Interaction (SMI) testing, and finally full scale flight testing are performed to verify that no adverse ASE interactions occur. Until a significant configuration or control system change occurs, the structural mode suppression filters provide adequate protection. When an adaptive system changes to respond to off-nominal rigid body behavior, the changes in control can affect the structural mode attenuation levels. In the case of a damaged vehicle, the frequency and damping of the structural modes can change. The combination of changing structural behavior with changing control system gains results in a system with a probability of adverse interactions that is very difficult to predict a priori. An onboard, measurement based method is needed to ensure that the system adjusts to attenuate any adverse ASE interaction before a sustained limit cycle and vehicle damage are encountered. This system must work in concert with the adaptive control system to allow the overall goal of re-gaining rigid body performance as much as possible without exacerbating the situation with ASE interactions.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety ,A1.09Pilot Interactions with Adaptive Control Systems under Off-Nominal Conditions, ARC, AFRC,"Adaptive control is a promising control technology that can enhance flight safety and performance. Adaptive control has been demonstrated to provide improved performance in many unmanned aerial systems. When operated in an autonomous mode such as in an autopilot, the behavior of an adaptive flight control system can be modeled and simulated with a sufficient degree of repeatability. The presence of a pilot working in a closed-loop fashion with an adaptive flight control presents an important problem that has not been well addressed. Adaptive control generally requires sufficiently rich input signals to improve parameter convergence, as the adaptive control system adapts to parametric changes in the vehicle dynamics or exogenous disturbances. The condition for rich input signals is known as persistent excitation. During adaptation under off-nominal conditions such as aircraft with damage, the pilot provides persistently exciting signals to the adaptive control system. There is generally a trade-off between adaptation and stability due to persistent excitation. With a high persistent excitation in the pilot inputs, the speed of adaptation increases and in theory better handling performance could be achieved. However, in practice, the high persistent excitation in the control signals can potentially cause significant cross-coupling between different flight control axes and or excite unmodeled dynamics such as aeroservoelastic modes. The overall effect of high persistent excitation could aggravate stability robustness of an adaptive flight control system with a pilot in the loop that results in poor handling qualities. Another aspect of pilot interactions with an adaptive control system is the potential interactions between two adaptive elements in a closed-loop fashion, because the pilot can also be viewed as an adaptive control system with a learning ability. With the pilot adaptive element providing high persistently exciting inputs into an adaptive flight control system with a predetermined adaptation rate, the issue of stability can be important and difficult to assess. To enable an adaptive flight control system to be operated with a pilot in the loop, it is necessary to develop new research techniques that can assess the effects of pilot interactions with an adaptive flight control system. These techniques should address pilot control responses via an adaptive model with features that can capture relevant interactions with an adaptive flight control system. Techniques for assessing pilot interactions via metrics that can quantify the pilot-vehicle system responses with an adaptive flight control system are also needed. Other aspects of the research can include new methods and tools that can provide an advisory function to limit the pilot control inputs in order to trade off between command-following performance and stability robustness. Research in adaptive control methods will address the system requirements to provide good flying characteristics when the human operator closes the control loop. In the presence of damage, failures, etc. the adaptive system must trade the stability requirements with closed loop handling requirements. Methods for selecting the best achievable handling are needed. The adaptation system needs to find a good compromise between suppression of coupling between the axis (i.e. pitch into roll, etc.) and good in-axis behavior. Better metrics to assess cross-coupled (asymmetric) behavior are needed. These metrics could provide a quantitative measurement of the severity of a given failure, as well as a measure of the improvement due to adaptation. As the adaptation changes the flying characteristics of the vehicle, some means of informing the operator is required to ensure that the system is not overdriven by a pilot who is expecting nominal performance.

These requirements go beyond standard fault isolation techniques. The emphasis is on the development of mathematically rigorous diagnostic technologies that are applicable to structures, propulsion systems, software, and other subsystems within the aircraft. Technologies developed must be able to perform diagnosis given heterogeneous and asynchronous signals coming from the health management components of the vehicle and integrating information from each of these components. The ability to actively query health management systems, use advanced decision making techniques to perform the diagnosis, and then assess the severity using these techniques are critical. As an example, the mathematical rigor of the diagnosis and severity assessment could be treated through a Bayesian methodology since it allows for characterization and propagation of uncertainties through models of aircraft failure and degradation. Both computational and prototype hardware implementations of the diagnostic capabilities are expected outcomes of this effort. Other methods could also be employed that appropriately model the uncertainties in the subsystem due to noise and other sources of uncertainty. The ability to actively query the underlying health management systems (whether they are related to detection or not) is critical to reducing the uncertainty in the diagnosis. As an example, if there is ambiguity in the diagnosis about the type and location of a particular failure in the aircraft structure, the diagnostic engine should be able to actively query that system or related systems to determine the true location and severity of the anomaly. Where possible, a rigorous mathematical framework should be employed to provide a rank ordered list of diagnoses, an assessment of the severity of each diagnosed event, along with a measure of the certainty in the diagnosis. Understanding and addressing the system integration and validation issues are critical components of this effort. Read less>>"

Aeroelastic behavior of flight vehicles is a particularly challenging facet of that goal. The program's work on aeroelasticity includes conduct of broad-based research and technology development to obtain a fundamental understanding of aeroelastic and unsteady-aerodynamic phenomena experienced by aerospace vehicles, in subsonic, transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic speed regimes.

The technical discipline of aeroelasticity is a critical ingredient necessary in the design process of a flight vehicle for assuring freedom from catastrophic aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic instabilities. This discipline requires a thorough understanding of the complex interactions between a flexible structure and the unsteady aerodynamic forces acting on the structure, and at times, active systems controlling the flight vehicle. Complex unsteady aerodynamic flow phenomena, particularly at transonic Mach numbers, are also very important because this is the speed regime most critical to encountering aeroelastic instabilities. In addition, aeroelasticity is presently being exploited as a means for improving the capabilities of high performance aircraft through the use of innovative active control systems using both aerodynamic and smart material concepts. Work to develop analytical and experimental methodologies for reliably predicting the effects of aeroelasticity and their impact on aircraft performance, flight dynamics, and safety of flight are valuable.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics ,A2.05Aerodynamics, LaRC," AFRC, ARC, GRC","The challenge of flight has at its foundation the understanding, prediction, and control of fluid flow around complex geometries - aerodynamics. Aerodynamic prediction is critical throughout the flight envelope for subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic vehicles - driving outer mold line definition, providing loads to other disciplines, and enabling environmental impact assessments in areas such as emissions, noise, and aircraft spacing. In turn, high confidence prediction enables high confidence development and assessment of innovative aerodynamic concepts. This subtopic seeks innovative physics-based models and novel aerodynamic concepts, with an emphasis on flow control, applicable in part or over the entire speed regime from subsonic through hypersonic flight. All vehicle classes will experience subsonic flight conditions. The most fundamental issue is the prediction of flow separation onset and progression on smooth, curved surfaces, and the control of separation. Supersonic and hypersonic vehicles will experience supersonic flight conditions. Fundamental to this flight regime is the sonic boom, which to date has been a barrier issue for a viable civil vehicle. Addressing boom alone is not a sufficient mission enabler however, as low drag is a prerequisite for an economically viable vehicle, whether only passing through the supersonic regime, or cruising there. Atmospheric entry vehicles and space access vehicles will experience hypersonic flight conditions. Reentry capsules such as the new Crew Exploration Vehicle deploy multiple parachutes during descent and landing. Predicting the physics of unsteady flows in supersonic and subsonic speeds is important for the design of these deceleration systems. The gas-dynamic performance of decelerators for vehicles entering the atmospheres of planets in the solar system is not well understood. Reusable hypersonic vehicles will be designed such that the lower body can be used as an integrated propulsion system in cruise condition.

The large size and high re-entry velocity of the Crew Exploration Vehicle and the conditions encountered in proposed aerocapture missions to Titan, Neptune, and Venus require study of shock layer radiation phenomena, radiative heat transfer, and non-equilibrium thermodynamic and transport properties; these in turn require understanding of the internal structure and dynamics of the constituent gases.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics ,"A2.08Aircraft Systems Analysis, Design and Optimization", GRC," ARC, LaRC","One of the approaches to achieve the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Program goals is to solve the aeronautics challenges for a broad range of air vehicles with system-level optimization, assessment and technology integration. The needs to meet this approach can be defined by four general themes:Design Environment Development; Variable Fidelity, Physics-Based Design/Analysis Tools; Technology Assessment and Integration; and Evaluation of Advanced Concepts.Current interdisciplinary design/analysis involves a multitude of tools not necessarily developed to work together, hindering their application to complete system design/analysis studies. Multi-fidelity, multi-disciplinary optimization frameworks, such as Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS), have been developed by NASA but have limited capabilities to simulate complete vehicle systems. Solicited topics are aligned with these four themes that will support this NASA research area. (1) Design Environment Development Technology development is needed to provide complex simulation and modeling capabilities where the computer science details are transparent to the engineer. A framework environment is needed to provide a seamless integration environment where the engineer need not be concerned with where or how particular codes within the system level simulation will be run. Interfaces and utilities to define, setup, verify, determine the appropriate resources, and launch the system simulation are also needed. Research challenges include the engineering details needed to numerically zoom (i.e., numerical analysis at various levels of detail) between multi-fidelity components of the same discipline, as well as, multi-discipline components of the same fidelity. A major computer science challenge is developing boundary objects that will be reused in a wide variety of simulations. Proposals will be considered that enable coupling differing disciplines, numerical zooming within a single discipline, deploying large simulations, and assembling and controlling secure or non-secure simulations. (2) Variable Fidelity, Physics-Based Design/Analysis Tools An integrated design process combines high-fidelity computational analyses from several disciplines with advanced numerical design procedures to simultaneously perform detailed Outer Mold Line (OML) shape optimization, structural sizing, active load alleviation control, multi-speed performance (e.g., low takeoff and landing speeds, but efficient transonic cruise), and/or other detailed-design tasks. Current practice still widely uses sequential, single-discipline optimization, at best coupling low-fidelity modeling of other relevant disciplines during the detailed design phase. Substantial performance improvements will be realized by developing closely integrated design procedures coupled with highest-fidelity analyses for use during detailed-design. Design procedures must enable rapid determination of sensitivities (gradients) of a design objective with respect to all design variables and constraints, choose search directions through design space without violating constraints, and make appropriate changes to the vehicle shape (ideally both external OML shape and internal structural element size). Solicitations are for integrated design optimization tools that find combinations of design variables from more than one discipline and can vary synergistically to produce superior performance compared to the results of sequential, single-discipline optimization or repeated cut-and-try analysis. (3) Technology Assessment and Integration Improved analysis capability of integrated airframe and propulsion systems would allow more efficient designs to be created that would maximize efficiency and performance while minimizing both noise and emissions. Improved integrated system modeling should allow designers to consider trade-offs between various design and operating parameters to determine the optimum design for various classes of subsonic fixed wing aircraft ranging from personal aircraft to large transports. The modeling would also be beneficial if it had enough fidelity to enable it to analyze both conventional and unconventional systems. Current analysis tools capable of analyzing integrated systems are based on simplified physical and semi-empirical models that are not fully capable of analyzing aircraft and propulsion system parameters that would be required for new or unconventional systems. Analysis tools are solicited that are capable of analyzing new and unconventional aircraft and propulsion integrated systems. These include: (1) New combustor designs, alternate fuel operation, and the ability to estimate all emissions, and (2) Noise source models (e.g., fan, jet, turbine, core and airframe components). Analyses tools that are scalable, especially to small aircraft, are desired. (4) Evaluation of Advanced Concepts Conceptual design and analysis of unconventional vehicle concepts and technologies is needed for technology portfolio investment planning, development of advanced concepts to provide technology pull, and independent technical assessment of new concepts. This capability will enable ""virtual expeditions through the design space"" for multi-mission trade studies and optimization. This will require an integrated variable fidelity concept design system. The aerospace flight vehicle conceptual design phase is, in contrast to the succeeding preliminary and detail design phases, the most important step in the product development sequence, because of its predefining function. However, the conceptual design phase is the least well understood part of the entire flight vehicle design process, owing to its high level of abstraction and associated risk, its multidisciplinary design complexity, its permanent shortage of available design information, and its chronic time pressure to find solutions. Currently, the important primary aerospace vehicle design decisions at the conceptual design level (e.g., overall configuration selection) are still made using extremely simple analyses and heuristics. An integrated, variable fidelity system would have large benefits. Higher fidelity tools enabling unconventional configurations to be addressed in the conceptual design process are solicited.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics ,A2.10Propulsion Systems, GRC," GRC, LaRC","This subtopic is divided into two parts. The first part is the Turbomachinery and Heat Transfer and the second part is Propulsion Integration. Turbomachinery and Heat Transfer There is a critical need for advanced turbomachinery and heat transfer concepts, methods and tools to enable NASA to reach its goals in the various Fundamental Aeronautics projects. These goals include drastic reductions in aircraft fuel burn, noise, and emissions, as well as an ability to achieve mission requirements for Subsonic Rotary Wing, Subsonic Fixed Wing, Supersonics, and Hypersonics Project flight regimes. In the compression system, advanced concepts and technologies are required to enable high stage loading and wider operating range while maintaining or improving aerodynamic efficiency. Such improvements will enable reduced weight and part count, and will enable advanced variable cycle engines for various missions. In the turbine, the very high cycle temperatures demanded by advanced engine cycles place a premium on the cooling technologies required to ensure adequate life of the turbine component. Reduced cooling flow rates and/or increased cycle temperatures enabled by these technologies have a dramatic impact on the engine performance. Proposals are sought in the turbomachinery and heat transfer area to provide the following specific items:Advanced design concepts to enable increased high stage loading in single and multi-stage axial compressors while maintaining or improving aerodynamic efficiency and operability. Technologies are sought that would reduce dependence on traditional range extending techniques (such as variable inlet guide vane and variable stator geometry) in compression systems. These may include flow control techniques near the compressor end walls and on the rotor and stator blade surfaces. Technologies are sought to reduce turbomachinery sensitivity to tip clearance leakage effects where clearance to chord ratios are on the order of 5% or above. Advanced flow analysis tools to enable design optimization of highly loaded compression systems that can accurately predict aerodynamic efficiency and operability. This includes computer codes with updated models for losses, turbulence, and other models that can simulate the flow through turbomachinery components with advanced design features such as swept and bowed blade shapes, flow range extension techniques, such as flow control and transition control to maintain acceptable operability and efficiency. Novel turbine cooling concepts are sought to enable very high turbine cooling effectiveness especially considering the manufacturability of such concepts. These concepts may include film cooling concepts, internal cooling concepts, and innovative methods to couple the film and internal cooling designs. Concepts proposed should have the potential to be produced with current or forthcoming manufacturing techniques. The availability of advanced manufacturing techniques may actually enable improved cooling designs beyond the current state-of-the-art. Methods are sought to enable more efficient use of coolant air in the turbine through coolant flow modulation. These methods could consist of open-loop or closed-loop coolant flow modulation. Modulations could be high-frequency with frequencies on the order of the turbine blade passing frequency or longer time scales on the order of engine thermal transients. Development of methods to measure turbine local and/or average surface temperatures to enable the closed-loop capability will be considered. Feedback control of the coolant flow rates and/or methods to produce modulation in actual turbine thermal environments are desired. Finally, a description of how the proposed technology will work in a vision modulated turbine cooling turbine system will be needed. Propulsion Integration Proposals for Propulsion Integration will address engine and engine integration topics as outlined in this section in support of the Fundamental Aeronautics Program. One objective of the Subsonic Fixed Wing Project is to develop verified analysis capabilities for the key technical issues related to integrating embedded propulsion systems for ""N+2"" hybrid wing/body configurations. These key technical issues include: inlet technologies for distorted engine inflows related to embedded engines with boundary layer ingestion; fan-face flow distortion and its effects on fan efficiency and operability, noise, flutter stability and aeromechanical stress and life; wide operability of the fan and core with a variable area nozzle; issues related to the implementation of a thrust vectoring variable area nozzle; and duct losses related to long flow paths associated with embedded engines. Specifically, proposals are sought to provide advanced technology, prediction methods and tools. The supersonics project would like proposals to develop tools and propulsion technologies that will enable the design of high performance fans; high-efficiency, low-boom, and stable inlets; high-performance, low-noise exhaust nozzles; and intelligent sensors and actuators for supersonic aircraft. The supersonics project is interested in both computational and experimental research, aimed at evaluating and analyzing promising technologies as well as understanding the fundamental flow physics that will enable improved prediction methods.

Continuous Flow Distributed Cooling Systems Distributed cooling provides increased lifetime of cryogen fluids for applications on both the ground and spaceborne platforms. This has impacts on payload mass and volume for flight systems which translate into costs (either on the ground, during launch or in flight).

Science,Topic S5 Robotic Exploration Technologies ,"S5.02Sample Collection, Processing, and Handling", JPL," ARC, GSFC, JSC","Robust systems for sample acquisition, handling and processing are critical to the next generation of robotic explorers for investigation of planetary bodies (http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10432&page=R1(link is external)). Limited spacecraft resources (power, volume, mass, computational capabilities, and telemetry bandwidth) demand innovative, integrated sampling systems that can survive and operate in challenging environments (extremes in temperature, pressure, gravity, vibration and thermal cycling). Special interest lies in sampling systems and components (actuators, gearboxes, etc.) that are suitable for use in the extremely hot high pressure environment at the Venusian surface (460ºC, 93 bar). Relevant systems could be integrated on multiple platforms, however of primary interest are samplers that could be mounted on a mobile platform, such as a rover. For reference, current Mars-relevant rovers range in mass from 200 - 800 kg. Sample Acquisition Research should be conducted to develop compact, low-power, lightweight subsurface sampling systems that can obtain 1 cm diameter cores of consolidated material (e.g., rock, icy regolith) up to 10 cm below the surface. Systems should be capable of autonomously acquiring and ejecting samples reliably. Also of interest are methods of autonomously exposing rock interiors from below weathered rind layers. Other sample types of interest are unconsolidated regolith, dust, and atmospheric gas. Sample Manipulation (core management, sub-sampling/sorting, powder transport) Sample manipulation technologies are needed to enable handling and transfer of structured and unstructured samples from a sampling device to instruments and sample processing systems. Core, cuttings, and regolith samples may be variable in size and composition, so a sample manipulation system needs to be flexible enough to handle the sample variability. Core samples will be on the order of 1 cm diameter and up to 10 cm long. Soil and rock fragment samples will be of similar volumes. Sample Integrity (encapsulation and contamination) For a sample return mission, it is critical to find solutions for maintaining physical integrity of the sample during the surface mission (rover driving loads, diurnal temperature fluctuations) as well as the return to Earth (cruise, atmospheric entry and impact). Technologies are needed for characterizing state of sample in situ - physical integrity (e.g., cracked, crushed), sample volume, mass or temperature, as well as retention of volatiles in solid (core, regolith) samples, and retention of atmospheric gas samples. Also of particular need are means of acquiring subsurface rock and regolith samples with minimum contamination. This contamination may include contaminants in the sampling tool itself, material from one location contaminating samples collected at another location (sample cross-contamination), or Earth-source microorganisms brought to the Martian surface prior to drilling ('clean' sampling from a 'dirty' surface). Consideration should be given to use of materials and processes compatible with 110 - 125°C dry heat sterilization. In situ sterilization may be explored, as well as innovative mechanical or system solutions - e.g., single-use sample ""sleeves,"" or fully-integrated sample acquisition and encapsulation systems. For a sample return mission, sample transfer of a payload into a planetary ascent vehicle: Automated payload transfer mechanisms; and Orbiting Sample (OS) sealing techniques.

Science,Topic S5 Robotic Exploration Technologies ,S5.03Surface and Subsurface Robotic Exploration, JPL," ARC, GSFC, JSC","Technologies are needed to enable access and sample acquisition at surface and subsurface sampling sites of scientific interest on Mars or the Moon. Mobility technology is needed to enable access to difficult-to-reach sites such as access through difficult and steep terrain. Manipulation technologies are needed to deploy instruments and sampling tools from vehicles. Many scientifically valuable sites are accessible only via terrain that is too difficult or steep for state-of-the-art planetary rovers to traverse. Sites include crater walls, canyons, and gullies. Tethered systems, non-wheeled systems, and marsupial systems are examples of mobility technologies that are of interest. Tether technology could enable new approaches for deployment, retrieval and mobility. Innovative marsupial systems could allow a pair of vehicles with different mobility characteristics to collaborate to enable access to challenging terrain. Single vehicle systems might utilize a 200 kg class rover and dual vehicle systems might utilize a 500 - 800 kg primary vehicle that provides long traverse to the vicinity of a challenging site and then deployment of a smaller 20 - 50 kg vehicle with steep mobility capability for access and sampling at the site. Technologies to enable acquisition of subsurface samples are also needed. For Mars in particular, technologies are needed to acquire core samples in the shallow subsurface to about 10cm and to enable subsurface sampling in multiple holes at least 1 - 3 meters deep through rock, regolith or ice compositions. Shallow subsurface sampling systems need to be low mass and deeper subsurface sampling solutions need to be integratable onto 500 - 800 kg stationary landers and mobile platforms. Consideration should be given for potential failure scenarios, such as platform slip and borehole misalignment for integrated systems, and the challenges of dry drilling into mixed media including icy mixtures of rock and regolith. Systems should ensure minimal contamination of samples from Earth-source contaminants and cross-contamination from samples at different locations or depths. Innovative component technologies for low-mass, low-power, and modular systems are of particular interest. Technical feasibility should be demonstrated during Phase 1 and a full capability unit of at least TRL level 4 - 6 should be delivered in Phase 2.

Balloons and airships are expected to carry scientific payloads on Venus and Titan in order to investigate their atmospheres in situ and their surfaces from close proximity. Their envelopes will be subject to extreme environments and must support missions with a range of durations. Proposals are sought in the following areas: Metal Balloons for High Temperature Venus Exploration Balloons made of metals are a potential solution to the problem of enabling long duration flight in the hot lower atmosphere of Venus. Proposals are sought for metal balloon concepts and prototypes that provide 1-5 m3 of fully inflated volume, areal densities of 1 kg/m2 or less, sulfuric acid compatibility at 85% concentration, and operation at 460°C for a period of up to 1 year. Rapid Buoyancy Modulation System for a Titan Montgolfiere Balloon Montgolfiere, or hot air, balloons are under development for use on a future mission to Titan. While systems are feasible based on the waste heat from a radioisotope power system (RPS), the large thermal inertias make it dangerous for such balloons to fly near the surface because of their inability to quickly respond to atmospheric turbulence or approach topographic hazards. Proposals are therefore sought for a rapid buoyancy modulation system that can be integrated into a 10 m diameter Titan Montgolfiere balloon operating at 90 K and using a steady-state RPS heat source in the range of 2 - 4 kW. This system needs to be lightweight (less than 10 kg) and consume a small amount of electrical power (less than 5 W average). Gas Management Systems for Titan Aerobots Hydrogen-filled aerobots at Titan must contend with the problem of gas leakage over long duration (1 year or more) flights. Proposals are sought for the development and testing of two kinds of prototype devices that can be carried on the aerobot to compensate for these gas leakage problems: one device is to produce make-up hydrogen gas from atmospheric methane; the other device is to remove atmospheric gas (mostly nitrogen) that leaks from the ballonets into the hydrogen-filled blimp. Both kinds of devices will need to operate on no more than 15 W of electrical power each while compensating for a leakage rate of at least 40 g/week of hydrogen or 500 g/week of nitrogen.

Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, NASA's high-end computing (HEC) projects (http://www.hec.nasa.gov/): the High End Computing Capability project at Ames and the Scientific Computing project at Goddard. To assure maximum relevance to NASA, funded SBIR contracts under this subtopic should engage in direct interactions with one or both HEC projects, and with key HEC users where appropriate. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and NASA relevance during Phase 1 and show a path toward a Phase 2 prototype demonstration. Offerors should demonstrate awareness of the state-of-the-art of their proposed technology, and should leverage existing commercial capabilities and research efforts where appropriate. Open source software and open standards are strongly preferred. Note that the NASA supercomputing environment is characterized by: HEC systems operating behind a firewall to meet strict IT security requirements, many applications requiring tight coupling and high concurrency, complex computational workflows and immense datasets, and the need to support hundreds of complex application codes - many of which are frequently updated by the user/developer. As a result, solutions that involve the following must clearly explain how they would work in the NASA environment: Grid computing, web services, client-server models, embarrassingly parallel computations, and technologies that require significant application re-engineering. Projects need not benefit all NASA HEC users or application codes, but demonstrating applicability to an important NASA discipline, or even a key NASA application code, could provide significant value. Specific technology areas of interest include:Integrated Environments: The user interface to a supercomputer is typically a command line in a text window. This subtopic element seeks more intuitive, intelligent, user-customized, and integrated interfaces to supercomputing resources, enabling users to more completely leverage the power of HEC to increase their productivity. Such an interface could enhance many essential supercomputing tasks: accessing and managing resources, training, getting services, developing codes, running computations, managing files and data, analyzing and visualizing results, transmitting data, collaborating, etc. Efficient Computing: In spite of the rapidly increasing capability and efficiency of supercomputers, NASA's HEC facilities cannot purchase, power, and cool sufficient HEC resources to satisfy all user demands. This subtopic element seeks dramatically more efficient and effective supercomputing approaches in terms of their ability to supply increased HEC capability or capacity per dollar and/or per Watt for real NASA applications. Examples include novel computational accelerators and architectures, more capable storage/interconnect/visualization technologies, improved algorithms for key codes, and power-aware ""Green"" computing technologies and techniques. HEC Ecosystem Modeling: NASA endeavors to maximize the productivity of its world-class HEC activities. To identify and prioritize improvement initiatives, this subtopic element seeks tools and techniques to routinely monitor and model the productivity of NASA's HEC ecosystem, including modeling change scenarios. The technology should model the workflows of HEC users, facility staff, and resources (supercomputers, storage, networks, etc.), and it should reflect constraints such as budget, power, and space.

In other software communities (and other programming languages), access to modern software tools has enabled large gains in productivity by providing high-level tools for isolating software defects (bugs) as well as by automating common, albeit tedious, software processes. The goal is to extend these capabilities to support the Fortran programming language so that NASA's scientific models can extract similar benefits.

As well, portable means for atmosphere revitalization that have synergy with extravehicular activity (EVA) equipment pertaining to trace contaminant control, carbon dioxide removal, humidity control are target technology areas. Durable, dust-tolerant fluid connections support the EVA and life support system infrastructure. Details on areas of emphasis are the following: High Pressure Oxygen Gas Supply and Conditioning: Process technologies leading to an on-demand, in-flight renewable 3,600-psia oxygen supply are of interest. Process technologies and techniques must be capable of conditioning oxygen for temperature, pressure, and water content using oxygen from several sources. Source oxygen may originate directly from the cabin atmosphere or from gaseous storage, cryogenic storage, and/or on-demand production from water electrolysis or in-situ resource utilization processes. There is specific interest in process technologies to remove water from saturated oxygen to provide a product having a dewpoint below -62°C. Atmospheric Resource Recycling Techniques: Process technologies suitable for conditioning and converting gaseous products produced by the Sabatier CO2 reduction reaction to useful products are of interest. Of particular interest are process technologies to recover moisture from a saturated stream of methane that contains residual CO2 and hydrogen reactants, to convert methane to products such as low molecular weight alcohols or other compounds suitable for use in power co-generation via fuel cells or other means, and to produce a solid carbon product via a regenerative process based on the Bosch reaction or a variant of the Bosch reaction. Particulate Matter Management Particulate matter suspended in the habitable cabin atmosphere is a challenge for all phases of crewed lunar surface exploration missions. Removing and disposing of particulate matter originating from sources internal to the habitable cabin and from lunar surface dust intrusion into the cabin environment is of interest. Staged techniques employing combinations of course media filtration (>50 micron size), inertial separation (2.5 micron size), and fine media filtration ( Atmosphere Revitalization for EVA Synergy exists between cabin atmosphere revitalization and EVA suits. Common functions include trace contaminant control, CO2 partial pressure control, and humidity control. Trace Contaminant Control for EVA Suits: EVA suits designed for long durations with minimal maintenance will require new methods of trace contaminant control to maintain spacesuit environments below Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentrations for toxic or irritating chemicals. Historically this has used activated charcoal. In the case of ISS EVA, the charcoal is regenerable with heat. A need exists for a reduced power solution, such as vacuum regeneration of a sorbent, or another, innovative, low consumable solution. Consideration of on-back, real-time EVA regeneration as well as post EVA regeneration is acceptable. Mars EVA CO2 and Humidity Control: ISS EVA suits utilize heat regenerable CO2 removal systems. These systems are heavy and require significant power for regeneration. Lunar EVA suits are planned to use a lightweight, vacuum regenerable amine system to remove CO2 and humidity from the suit. It is envisioned this concept could be extensible to Mars suits with the addition of sweep gas to prevent intrusion of the Martian atmosphere. An innovative CO2 and humidity removal system that could remove CO2 and humidity while eliminating gas losses to the Martian atmosphere, remain lightweight, and utilize minimal power is desired. Consideration of on-back, real-time EVA regeneration as well as post EVA regeneration is acceptable.

The thermal control system designs also must accommodate the harsh thermal environments associated with these missions. Modular, reconfigurable designs could limit the number of required spares. The lunar environment presents several challenges to the design and operation of active thermal control systems. During the approximately 2 hour lunar orbit, the environment can range from extremely cold to near room temperature. Polar lunar bases will see unrelenting cold thermal environments, as will the radiators for Martian transit spacecraft. In both cases the effective sink temperature will approach absolute zero. Innovative thermal management components and systems are needed to accomplish the rejection of waste heat during these future missions. Advances are sought in the general areas of radiators, thermal control loops, thermal system equipment, and EVA thermal control. Systems with enhanced thermal mass may be required to deal with the lunar orbital environment. Variable emissivity coatings (near unity emissivity with the ability to reduce emissivity by at least a factor of ten), clever working fluid selection (a freezing point approaching 150K), or robust design could be used to prevent radiator damage from freezing in cold environments at times of low heat load. Part of the thermal control system in a habitable volume is likely to be a condensing heat exchanger, which should be designed to preclude microbial growth. Small, highly reliable, heat pumps could be used to provide 278 K cold fluid to the heat exchanger, allowing the loop temperatures to approach 300 K, thus reducing the size of the radiators. Future space systems may generate waste heat in excess of 10 kW which could either be rejected or redirected to areas which require it. Novel thermal bus systems which can collect, transport (over a distance of ~30 meters), and provide heat for components are sought. The system should be highly flexible and adaptable to changes in equipment locations. Possible systems include single and two-phase pumped fluid loops, capillary-based loops, and heat pumps. Innovative design of the loops and components is needed. Historically spacesuits have used water sublimators to provide heat rejection. Development of a low-venting or non-venting regenerable individual life support subsystem(s) concept for crewmember cooling and heat rejection is desired.

Exploration Systems,Topic X13 Space Human Factors and Food Systems ,X13.01An Automated Tool for Human Factors Evaluations, JSC, ARC,"This subtopic calls for a Small Business Innovative Research project to develop an automated tool to assist non-human factors engineers to conduct human factors evaluations. Human factors evaluations are essential in gathering human performance data and analyzing the usability of new design concepts. These evaluations are generally carried out by human factors experts due to the level of expertise required. However, in some cases, it would both save time and cost if a tool is available for non-human factors engineers to carry out a standardized evaluation procedure to obtain the needed data and with comparable quality. The tool therefore shall provide a comprehensive set of measurement methods and guide non-human factors engineer to carry out human factors evaluations. The tool development shall include defining a comprehensive set of commonly used human factors evaluation methods that allow engineers to gather relevant human factors data. Through a user-friendly interface, the tool shall recommend evaluation metrics, provide step-by-step guidance for setting up the evaluation, and summarize/store evaluation data. The ability for the tool provide interfaces for human factors data acquisition systems is highly desirable. An algorithm for the tool is expected as the deliverable for Phase 1 and a prototype is expected should the project continue on to Phase 2. Read less>>"
Exploration Systems,Topic X13 Space Human Factors and Food Systems ,X13.02Situational Awareness for Multi-Agent Operations, JSC, ARC,"This subtopic calls for a Small Business Innovative Research project to develop a situation awareness and conflict resolution tool for a wide-area multi-agent operation environment with substantial time delays. Humans and robots in future Lunar or Mars surface operations would be operating both on the Lunar (Mars) surface and on Earth remotely to carry out a common task. Consequently, substantial communication delay would make tasks planning and execution difficult. The goal of this SBIR is to develop a tool so multiple agents can work harmoniously regardless of geographical locations. The tool therefore shall overcome the hurdle of communication delays and (1) enable situation awareness by providing timely information of tasks conducted by other agents, (2) ensure that newly generated procedures mesh well with the originally scheduled activities, (3) allow operators to poll state data from all agents at any moment, and (4) provide recommendations for best task planning and procedures. An algorithm for the tool is expected as the deliverable for Phase 1 and a prototype is expected should the project continue on to Phase 2. Read less>>"
Exploration Systems,Topic X13 Space Human Factors and Food Systems ,X13.03Advanced Food Technologies, JSC, ARC,"The purpose of the Advanced Food Technology Project is to develop, evaluate and deliver food technologies for human centered spacecraft that will support crews on missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. Safe, nutritious, acceptable, and varied shelf-stable foods with a shelf life of 3 - 5 years will be required to support the crew during future exploration missions to the Moon or Mars. Concurrently, the food system must efficiently balance appropriate vehicle resources such as mass, volume, water, air, waste, power, and crew time. One of the objectives during the lunar outpost missions is to test technologies that can be used during the Mars missions. It will require approximately 10,000 kg of packaged food for a 6-crew, 1000 day mission to Mars. The packaged food will require that the safety, nutrition, and acceptability are maintained at reasonable levels for the entire 5-year shelf life. Therefore, this subtopic request will concentrate on technologies that use a systems approach to provide food in remote locations with limited mass, volume, power, and waste is required. It has been proposed to use a food system which incorporates processing of raw ingredients into edible ingredients and uses these edible ingredients in recipes in the galley to produce meals. This type of food system will require technologies that will allow these raw ingredients to maintain their functionality and nutrition for 5-years. This food system would also require food processing and food preparation equipment. The equipment should be miniaturized, multipurpose and efficiently use vehicle resources such as mass, volume, water, and power. There are some unique parameters that need to be considered when developing the technologies. The Moon's gravity is 1/6 of Earth's gravity. In addition, it is being proposed that the habitat will have a reduced atmospheric pressure of 8 psia which is equivalent to a 16,000 foot mountain top. These two factors will affect the heat and mass transfer during food processing and food preparation of the food. In addition, there also will not be any significant refrigerator or freezer available. The response to this subtopic should include a plan to develop a technology that will enable safe and timely food processing and food preparation in reduced cabin pressure and reduced gravity. Phase 1 Requirements: Phase 1 should concentrate on the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of the proposed innovation resulting in a feasibility report and concept, complete with analyses and top-level drawings.

Exploration Systems,Topic X14 Space Radiation ,X14.01Active Charged Particle and Neutron Radiation Measurement Technologies, ARC, JSC,"For exploration class missions, there is extraordinary premium on compact and reliable active detection systems to meet very stringent size and power requirements. NASA requires compact, low power, active monitors that can measure charged particle spectrum and flux separately from neutrons and other radiations. Also, NASA requires compact active neutron spectrometers that can measure the neutron component of the dose separate from the charged particles. Advanced technologies up to technology readiness level (TRL) 4 are requested in the following areas: Charged Particle Spectrometer Measure charge and energy spectra of protons and other ions (Z = 2 to 26) and be sensitive to charged particles with LET of 0.2 to 1000 keV/m. For Z less than 3, the spectrometer should detect energies in the range 30 MeV/n to 400 MeV/n. For Z = 3 to 26, the spectrometer should detect energies in the range 50 MeV/n to 1 GeV/n. Design goals for mass should be 2 kg and for volume, 3000 cc. The spectrometer should be able to measure charged particles at both ambient conditions in space (0.01 mGy/hr) and during a large solar particle event (100 mGy/hr). The time resolution should be less than or equal to 1 minute. The spectrometer shall be able to perform data reduction internally and provide processed data. Neutron Spectrometer Measure neutron energy spectra in the range of 0.5 MeV to 150 MeV. Measure neutrons at ambient conditions such that proton/ion veto capability should be approaching 100% at solar minimum GCR rates; measure ambient dose equivalent of 0.02 mSv in a 1 hour measurement period, using ICRP 74 (1997) conversion factors; store all necessary science data for post measurement data evaluation. Design goals for mass and volume should be 5 kg and 6000 cc, respectively. Read less>>"
Exploration Systems,Topic X14 Space Radiation ,X14.02Miniature Radiation Pulse Processing Electronics, ARC, JSC,"For Exploration class missions, there is extraordinary premium on compact and reliable active detection systems to meet very stringent size and power requirements. Miniaturized electronics for radiation pulse processing would be important to help reduce size/power needs. Very small technologies (chips) are developed by the computer industry that may be adaptable to process radiation induced pulses from detectors to provide multi-channel analysis (MCA) and other analysis functions with very low power and size requirements. This is a need for NASA as power and size requirements are severely tightened on future missions to the Moon and beyond. Advanced technologies up to technology readiness level (TRL) 4 are requested in this area. The miniature processor must not exceed 0.2 W of power and have a volume not to exceed 20 cc. A communication interface, such as USB or other serial interface, is required. A fast clock rate is required, not less than 100 MHz. An analog-to-digital converter, minimum sample rate of 10 M samples per second. Could be part of chip or on the same board with chip. Requires adequate pulse height measurement to perform MCA, e.g., peak hold, digital waveform processing, or other approach. MCA should cover the input pulse height range of .002 to 10 volts (or equivalent) in either 100 channels on log scale or in two linear spectra of not less than 250 channels each with different gains.

Exploration Systems,Topic X15 Inflight Biological Sample Preservation and Analysis ,X15.01Alternative Methods for Ambient Preservation of Human Biological Samples during Spaceflight and Lunar Operations, JSC, JSC,"Measurement of blood and urine analytes is a common clinical medicine practice used for differential disease diagnosis and determination of the therapeutic response to treatment. Accurate biochemical results depend on maintaining the integrity of blood and urine samples until analyses can be completed. Improper sample collection, handling, or preservation may lead to critical errors in diagnostic interpretation of analytical results. Traditional methods have been developed that include the use of sample component separation by means of centrifugation, refrigeration, freezing or the addition of preservatives to maintain the integrity of biological samples. While such techniques are easily achieved in a routine clinical setting, the spaceflight environment presents unique challenges to sample processing and stowage. Thus, novel on-orbit methods for the ambient preservation of biological samples are critical for scientific research, monitoring of crew health and evaluation of countermeasure efficacy. The development of alternative innovative techniques with advantages over currently used methods for processing and preserving biological samples at ambient temperatures during spaceflight that provide a high level of reliability in maintaining a wide array of both blood and urine analytes over a long period of ambient stowage is highly desirable.Read less>>"

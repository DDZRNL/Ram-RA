Focus Area 1 In-Space Propulsion Technologies,T2.04Advanced in-space propulsion,"Electrostatic Solar Sail (E-Sail) Advancement
","The E-Sail is a propellant-less in-space propulsion system that utilizes electrostatic repulsion of solar wind (off of an electrically biased tether) to generate thrust. Preliminary studies indicate several advantages of this technology, including enabling access to interstellar space with transit times significantly faster than state-of-the-art (SOA) technologies. For this year's E-Sail investments, concepts to advance the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the E-sail guidance, navigation, and control system and/or robust models for spacecraft dynamics both during deployment as well as during operation are solicited. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is currently conceptualizing a 6-12U, ~10km total tether length E-Sail demonstration. Neither a specific architecture nor specific requirements have yet been detailed, however, responders should focus efforts in their proposed work towards this size spacecraft while keeping eventual scaling to as much as a 10x larger spacecraft in mind.
",3 to 6,"Prototype, Analysis, Hardware, Software, and/or Research
","Phase I proof of concept and/or preliminary guidance, navigation & control (GN&C) designs and/or models that will lead to Phase II medium to high fidelity prototypes ready for system infusion (in case of hardware), system analysis (in case of models), and/or advanced TRL testing (space environments testing) to support a MSFC led technology demonstration mission. Beyond Phase II, infusion into the planned E-Sail Technology Demonstration Missions (TDM) via a Phase III, IIE, directed work, etc. or additional development/test via an Announcement of Collaborative Opportunity (ACO) may be potential opportunities.
","The E-Sail concept has potential to enable practical access to interstellar space and fast travel beyond our solar system. The E-Sail has several open technology gaps. NASA is systematically reducing known risks of full system implementation prior to a flight demonstration. State of the Art GN&C systems and modeling have limitations due to the complex and changing dynamics of an E-Sail system. A critical gap is robust and high fidelity GN&C modeling and/or concepts for control of the E-Sail vehicle.
","An Electrostatic Sail E-Sail is a propellant-less advanced propulsion system that harnesses solar wind by electrostatic repulsion. Note, this contrasts Solar Sails, which utilize optical reflection of solar photons. E-Sail is comprised of thin tethers, which are electrically biased to form large electric fields. These fields create a virtual sail that repels solar ions and generates thrust. A key advantage is this mechanism better maintains thrust as it moves away from the sun – falling off at only 1/distance, substantially better than the solar sail 1/d^2. E-Sail will rapidly improve transit time within and to the edge of the solar system as well as enable out of plan maneuvers not currently possible.

Focus Area 1 In-Space Propulsion Technologies,T2.04Advanced in-space propulsion,"Large Scale Freeform Additive Fabrication using GRCop-42 and Gradient Alloys
","NASA is interested in soliciting proposals to develop a process for large scale freeform fabrication using additive manufacturing of GRCop-42 and functional gradient materials. Components such as rocket nozzles and heat exchangers are actively-cooled with internal channel features and require high performance materials in the extreme environment. Typically these components are made from a monolithic alloy, although various alloys and functional gradient materials could increase performance and optimize the overall system. The objective of this solicitation is to complete process development (i.e., directed energy deposition, coldspray, etc.) to fabricate a freeform component that incorporates thin-wall integral channels into a structure. This process should focus on GRCop-42 (Cu-Cr-Nb) and transition to an alternate material using a functional gradient process. The proposer should provide a technique and approach to axially transition from the GRCop-42 to alternate alloy (Superalloy, Stainless, High Entropy Alloys) providing a compatible functional gradient joint to minimize stresses. A thorough development approach would include process development, initial characterization and testing of the GRCop-42 and functional gradient alloys, process demonstration of manufacturing technology demonstrators (MTD), and trade study and/or planning to increase the scale to several feet in diameter.
",3 to 6,"Prototype, Analysis, Hardware, and/or Research
","Phase I: Develop a process for fabricating (using directed energy deposition, coldspray, etc.) a freeform structure that incorporates thin-wall integral channels targeting a heat exchanger, combustion chamber, rocket nozzle, channel-cooled structure and provide a trade on combination of compatible materials, with NASA inputs.
Leading to Phase II: Complete fabrication of process development samples using GRCop-42 and functional gradient alloys (Superalloy, High Entropy Alloys) to change the material axially along the component; and complete process characterization, mechanical testing, materials evaluation to provide first order design data. Fabricate manufacturing demonstrator components with integral channels with materials selected. Provide components that NASA could perform benchtop, flow, and/or hot-fire testing. Demonstrate a manufacturing technology component with integral channels and that is larger than 16” diameter with the GRCop-42 and functionally gradient alloys. Provide scale-up to >40” diameter.
","NASA has been developing various additive manufacturing technologies in GRCop-42 using laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) and currently working to mature large-scale (>3 ft dia) blown powder directed energy deposition (DED) process using NASA HR-1 and JBK-75. These technologies have been limited to monolithic materials though. Additional development has included bimetallic cladding (radial deposition) to provide superalloy jackets on copper-alloy combustion chambers under the Low Cost Upper Stage Propulsion (LCUSP) project, however this technology is not easily accessible at service companies. While the technology exist to fabricate components at sizes <16” diameter using laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) using GRCop-42, this is limited to a monolithic material in the axial direction. There are also no current additive techniques to rapidly fabricate GRCop-42 structures larger than this scale.
There are also additional challenges in this approach with a binary transition from one alloy to another. Optimized structures for heat exchanges and combustion devices would include the ability to fabricate large structures with complex internal features and vary/transition alloys along the axial length of a component (not just radial). This would allow for a more compliant bond between a copper-alloy and alternate material instead of a drastic change in alloys. This would reduce risk of joints. A further gap is the ability to produce copper-alloys, such as GRCop-42, in scales larger than 16” diameter. This provides new solutions for designers of large engines and structures providing higher thermal margins on the walls with the use of copper. The copper technology using additive manufacturing does not exist using directed energy deposition (DED) or other technologies at this scale.

Focus Area 1 In-Space Propulsion Technologies,Z10.01Cryogenic Fluid Management,,"This subtopic seeks technologies related to cryogenic propellant (e.g. hydrogen, oxygen, methane) storage and transfer to support NASA's space exploration goals. This includes a wide range of applications, scales, and environments consistent with future NASA missions. Such missions include, but are not limited to upper stages, ascent and descent stages, refueling elements or aggregation stages, nuclear thermal propulsion, and in-situ resource utilization. Anticipated outcome of Phase 1 proposals are expected to deliver proof of the proposed concept with some sort of basic testing or physical demonstration. Proposals shall include plans for a prototype and demonstration in a defined relevant environment (with relevant fluids) at the conclusion of Phase II.
Desired technology concepts are listed below in order of priority:
Develop cryogenic mass flow meters applicable to liquid oxygen and methane, having a volumetric flow measurement capacity of 1 - 20 L/min (fluid line size of approximately ½ inch), of rugged design that is able to withstand launch-load vibrations (e.g., 20g rms), with remote powered electronics (not attached to the flowmeter), able to function accurately in microgravity and vacuum environment, and having measurement error less than +/- 0.5% of the mass flow rate reading. Ability to measure bi-directional flow, compatibility with liquid hydrogen, and ability to measure mass flow rate during two-phase flows is also desired. Designs that can tolerate gas flow without damage to the flowmeter are also desired. Goal is Proof of concept end of Phase 1. Working prototype flow meter end of Phase 2. Broad area cooling methods for cryogenic composite propellant tanks (reduced and/or zero boil-off applications or liquefaction): Design and integration concepts must exhibit low mass, high-heat transfer between cooling fluid and propellant in tank, high heat exchanger efficiency (>90%), and operate in reduced gravity environments (10-6 g worse case). Proposers should consider structural and pressure vessel implications of the proposed concept. Target applications include liquid oxygen liquefaction system (16 g/s neon gas, 85K < T < 90K, pressure drop < 0.25 psia, 2.6m diameter, 3m tall tank) and reduced and/or zero boil off liquid hydrogen nuclear thermal propulsion system (3.5 g/s helium gas, 20K < T < 24K, 7m diameter, 8m tall tank). Cryogenic liquid/vapor phase separators capable of delivering single-phase liquid flow at least up to 10 gallons per minute, void fractions up to 30%, with an emphasis on minimizing pressure drop across the separator. Devices should be able to maintain performance (phase separation at highest flow rate) after multiple (> 15) thermal cycles (room temperature to 77K and back). Phase separator should tolerate transient (transfer line and separator are chilling down). Phase 1 concept should yield a proof of concept using liquid cryogens. Phase 2 should focus on minimizing phase separator pressure drop, overall integration of phase separator into transfer system (i.e. where to route the vapor), and development a unit to test in liquid hydrogen.
NASA has plans to purchase services for delivery of payloads to the Moon through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contract. Under this subtopic, proposals may include efforts to develop payloads for flight demonstration of relevant technologies in the lunar environment. The CLPS payload accommodations will vary depending on the particular service provider and mission characteristics. Additional information on the CLPS program and providers can be found at this link: https://www.nasa.gov/content/commercial-lunar-payload-services. CLPS missions will typically carry multiple payloads for multiple customers. Smaller, simpler, and more self-sufficient payloads are more easily accommodated and would be more likely to be considered for a NASA-sponsored flight opportunity. Commercial payload delivery services may begin as early as 2020 and flight opportunities are expected to continue well into the future. In future years it is expected that larger and more complex payloads will be accommodated. Selection for award under this solicitation will not guarantee selection for a lunar flight opportunity.

","Phase I proposals should at minimum deliver proof of the concept, including some sort of testing or physical demonstration, not just a paper study. Phase II proposals should provide component validation in a laboratory environment preferably with hardware deliverable to NASA.
","Cryogenic Fluid Management is a cross-cutting technology suite that supports multiple forms of propulsion systems (nuclear and chemical), including storage, transfer, and gauging, as well as liquefaction of ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization) produced propellants. STMD (Space Technology Mission Directorate) has identified that Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM) technologies are vital to NASA's exploration plans for multiple architectures, whether it is hydrogen/oxygen or methane/oxygen systems including chemical propulsion and nuclear thermal propulsion. Several recent Phase IIs have resulted from CFM subtopics, most notably for advanced insulation, cryocoolers, and liquid acquisition devices.
","STMD strives to provide the technologies that are needed to enable exploration of the solar system, both manned and unmanned systems; cryogenic fluid management is a key technology to enable exploration. Whether liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen or liquid oxygen/liquid methane is chosen by HEO (Human Exploration and Operations) as the main in-space propulsion element to transport humans, CFM will be required to store propellant for up to 5 years in various orbital environments. Transfer will also be required, whether to engines or other tanks (e.g. depot/aggregation), to enable the use of cryogenic propellants that have been stored. In conjunction with ISRU, oxygen will have to be produced, liquefied, and stored, the latter two of which are CFM functions for the surface of the Moon or Mars. ISRU and CFM liquefaction drastically reduces the amount of mass that has to be landed.

Focus Area 1 In-Space Propulsion Technologies,"Z10.04Manufacturing processes enabling lower-cost, in-space electric propulsion thrusters","Material joining in hollow cathodes
","SOA hollow cathodes in thrusters are complex assemblies with metal-to-ceramic (e.g., alumina, magnesium oxide, etc.) and metal-to-metal joints where dissimilar materials may have large thermal expansion mismatches. In such cathodes, operating temperatures can range from 1000 - 1700 °C (necessitating the use of refractory metals such as molybdenum, rhenium, tantalum, tungsten, etc.), and material joints must be able to survive in excess of 10,000 thermal on-off cycles without failure. Existing material joining processes used to construct Hall-effect and ion thruster cathodes have demonstrated inconsistencies in joint strength and the presence of impurities that may degrade cathode performance during vacuum operations. Efforts to mitigate these issues have to date contributed to the high cost for the integrated cathode assembly and thruster; thus, making them less attractive for commercial usage, particularly for small satellite propulsion applications. Proposed material joining processes to this area must be compatible with critical high-temperature materials; be performed readily, reliably, and with some economy; demonstrate structural integrity at typical cathode operating conditions; and avoid contaminant release that could degrade the performance of common cathode emitter materials such as barium oxide (BaO) and lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6).

Focus Area 1 In-Space Propulsion Technologies,"Z10.04Manufacturing processes enabling lower-cost, in-space electric propulsion thrusters","High-temperature electromagnets
","Thermal management of integrated electric propulsion systems is often challenging, especially for compact micro-propulsion devices or high-power-density systems. For thrusters with electromagnetic coils, such as Hall-effect thrusters or plasma thrusters utilizing magnetic nozzles, these magnetic circuits may experience operational temperatures in excess of 500 ºC due to coil self-heating and close proximity to plasma-wetted surfaces; such magnetic circuits, may also need to survive in excess of 10,000 thermal on-off cycles without failure. High wire packing density is frequently desirable to achieve high magnetomotive forces (i.e., high ampere-turns). This is facilitated by small wire diameters with thin insulation, with the drawback of being more susceptible to heating and insulation failure. Existing processes for manufacturing and potting magnetic wire have exhibited instances of insulation and potting degradation during thruster operations that can lead to early thruster failure; however, the associated extensive acceptance testing required to ensure high reliability contributes to the current high cost of thrusters. Proposed solutions to this scope area must be compatible with high ampere-turn, multi-layer electromagnets; be fray-resistant; and avoid performance degradation at the operational conditions indicated above. Any formation of volatile materials under operational conditions, particularly if binders or potting materials are used (e.g., for electrical insulation between wire layers or for thermal management), must be limited so as to preserve the insulating materials' dielectric strength and to remain compliant with general NASA material outgassing guidelines (i.e., < 1% total mass loss and < 0.1% collected volatile condensable material).

Focus Area 1 In-Space Propulsion Technologies,"Z10.04Manufacturing processes enabling lower-cost, in-space electric propulsion thrusters","Robust ceramics for Hall-effect thruster discharge channels
","State-of-the-art Hall-effect thrusters make use of hot-pressed, hexagonal boron nitride (BN) or derivative ceramics, for the machined discharge channel in which plasma is generated and accelerated. The discharge channel (typically with outer diameters between 2 and 14 inches depending on the thruster's power level) must maintain electrical isolation between the thruster electrodes while being subjected to an energetic plasma environment, large thermal gradients and transients, and back-sputtered material from other thruster components or the vacuum test facility. To date, these materials have exhibited substantial lot-to-lot variability in key material properties (including mechanical strength, moisture sensitivity, and thermal conductivity and emissivity) that have resulted in discharge channel damage during vibration, shock, and thermal testing of the assembled thruster. Such material property inconsistencies have thus necessitated costly thruster design features to improve survivability margins against mechanical and thermal shock. Proposed processes to improve the lot-to-lot consistency should focus on the BN family of materials or similar ceramics compatible (i.e., exhibiting low ion-bombardment sputtering yields) with a Hall-effect thruster's discharge plasma.

Focus Area 2 Power Energy and Storage,S3.02Dynamic Power Conversion,,"NASA is developing Dynamic Radioisotope Power Systems (DRPS) for unmanned robotic missions to the moon, and other solar system bodies of interest. This technology directly aligns with the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) strategic technology investment plan for space power and energy storage and could be infused into a highly efficient RPS for missions to dark, dusty, or distant destinations where solar power is not practical. Current work in dynamic radioisotope power systems is focused on novel Stirling, Brayton, or Rankine convertors that would be integrated with one or more 250 watt-thermal General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) modules or 1 watt-thermal Light Weight Radioisotope heater Unit (RHU) to provide high thermal-to-electric efficiency, low mass, long life, and high reliability for planetary spacecraft, landers, and rovers. Heat is transferred from the radioisotope heat source assembly to the power convertor hot end using conductive or radiative coupling. Power convertor hot end temperatures would generally range from 300-500 °C for RHU applications and 500-800 °C for GPHS applications. Waste heat is removed from the cold end of the power convertor at temperatures ranging from 20-175 °C, depending on the application, using conductive coupling to radiator panels. The NASA projects target power systems able to produce a range of electrical power output levels based on the available form factors of space rated fuel sources. These include a very low range of 0.5-2.0 watt-electric that would utilize one or more RHU, a moderately range of 40-70 watt-electric that would utilize a single GPHS Step-2 module, and a high range of 100-500 watt-electric that would utilize multiple GPHS Step-2 modules. For these power ranges, one or more power convertors could be used to improve overall system reliability. The current solicitation is focused on innovations that enable efficient and robust power conversion systems. Areas of interest include:
Robust, efficient, highly reliable, and long-life thermal-to-electric power convertors that would be used to populate a generator of a prescribed electric power output range. Electronic controllers applicable to Stirling, Brayton, or Rankine power convertors. Multi-Layered Metal Insulation (MLMI) for minimizing environmental heat losses and maximizing heat transfer from the radioisotope heat source assembly to the power convertor. Advanced dynamic power conversion components and RPS integration components, including efficient alternators able to survive extended exposure to 200 °C, robust high-temperature tolerant Stirling regenerators, robust highly effective recuperators, integrated heat pipes, and radiators that improve system performance, and improving the margin, reliability, and fault tolerance for existing components.

","The desired deliverables include prototype hardware that has demonstrated basic functionality in a laboratory environment and the appropriate research and analysis used to develop the hardware. Deliverables also include maturation options for flight designs.
","Radioisotope Power Systems are critical for long duration NASA missions in dark, dusty, or harsh environments. Thermoelectric systems have been used on the very successful RPS flown in the past, but are limited in efficiency. Dynamic thermal energy conversion provides significantly higher efficiency and through proper engineering of the non-contact moving components, can eliminate wear mechanisms and provide long life. While high efficiency performance of dynamic power convertors has been proven, reliable and robust systems tolerant of off-nominal operation is needed. In addition to convertors appropriate for General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) RPS, advances in much smaller and lower power dynamic power conversion systems are sought that can utilize Radioisotope Heater Units (RHU) for applications such as distributed sensor systems, small spacecraft, and other systems that take advantage of lower power electronics for the exploration of surface phenomenon on icy moons and other bodies of interest. While the power convertor advances are essential, to develop reliable and robust systems for future flight, advances in convertor components as well as RPS integration components are also needed. These would include efficient alternators able to survive 200 C, robust high-temperature tolerant regenerators, robust high efficiency recuperators, heat pipes, radiators, and controllers applicable to Stirling flexure-bearing, Stirling gas-bearing, or Brayton convertors.

This balanced suite of missions shows the need for low mass/volume energy storage that can effectively operate in extreme environments for future NASA Science Missions.
Future science missions will require advanced primary and secondary battery systems capable of operating at temperature extremes from -200° C for outer planet missions to 400 to 500° C for Venus missions, and a span of -230° C to +120° C for missions to the Lunar surface. Operational durations of 60 days for Titan and 14 days for the Moon are of interest. Advancements to battery energy storage capabilities that address operation at extreme temperatures combined with high specific energy and energy density (>200 Wh/kg and >200 Wh/l) are of interest in this solicitation.

Phase II emphasis should be placed on developing and demonstrating the technology under relevant test conditions. Additionally, a path should be outlined that shows how the technology could be commercialized or further developed into science-worthy systems.
","State-of the-art primary and rechargeable cells are limited in both capacity and temperature range. Typical primary Li-SO2 and Li-SOCl2 operate within a max temperature range of -40 to 80 deg C but suffer from capacity loss, especially at low temperatures. At -40 deg C, the cells will provide roughly half the capacity available at room temperature. Similarly, rechargeable Li-ion cells operate within a narrow temperature range of -20 to 40 C and also suffer from capacity loss at lower temperatures. The lower limit of temperature range of rechargeable cells can be extended through the use of low temperature electrolytes, but with limited rate capability and concerns over lithium plating on charge. There is currently a gap that exists for high temperature batteries, primary and rechargeable, that can operate at Venus atmospheric temperatures. This solicitation is aimed at the development of cells that can maintain performance at extreme temperatures so as to minimize or eliminate the need for strict thermal management of the batteries, which adds complexity and mass to the spacecraft.
","These batteries are applicable over a broad range of science missions. Low temperature batteries are needed for potential NASA decadal missions to Ocean Worlds (Europa, Enceladus, and Titan) and the Icy Giants (Neptune, Uranus). These batteries are also needed for science missions on the lunar surface. Low temperature batteries developed under this subtopic would enhance these missions and could be potentially enabling if the missions are mass or volume limited. There is also significant interest in a Venus surface mission that will require primary and/or rechargeable batteries that can operate for 60+ days on the surface of Venus. A high temperature battery that can meet these requirements is enabling for this class of missions.

Focus Area 2 Power Energy and Storage,Z1.03Kilowatt-Class Energy Conversion for Small Fission Reactors,"Kilowatt-Class Fission Energy Conversion
","NASA is considering the use of kilowatt class Fission Power Systems for surface missions to the moon and Mars. This technology directly aligns with the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) roadmap for space power and energy storage. Prior work in fission power systems had focused on a 1kWe ground demonstration, however, NASA desires to scale-up the system and components for a flight demo mission to the lunar surface, so component technologies that support a 10kWe-class fission power system are sought that address the following technical challenges:
Robust, efficient, highly reliable, and long-life thermal-to-electric power conversion in the range of 1-10kWe. Stirling, Brayton, and thermoelectric convertors that can be coupled to Kilopower reactors are of interest. Freeze tolerant heat pipe radiators that can operate through lunar night (-173 ºC) and day (127 ºC) temperature swings. Heat pipes must start-up from lunar night temperature and begin transferring heat within several thermal cycles. Radiation shield materials selection, design, and fabrication for mixed neutron and gamma environments, with consideration for mass effectiveness, manufacturability, and cost. Radiation tolerant generator control electronics designed to withstand an induced radiation environment in addition to the ambient environment in space. These electronics can include: source control and generation, high voltage outputs with dynamic response needed to meet power quality standards, short term heating prior to startup, shunt control to manage excess power production, and source monitoring for power management. Target dose tolerance ranges for fission power system electronics are between 1E11 to 1E13 n/cm2 total neutron fluence, and between 100 kRad (Si) and 1000kRad (Si) total ionizing gamma dose. Natural space environment should also be considered, with specific attention to Single Event Effect susceptibility.
The desired deliverables are primarily prototype hardware, research, and analysis to demonstrate concept feasibility and a TRL range of 3 to 5. The prototype hardware may include one (or more) of the following:
Power convertor (hot-end temperature = 800 ºC, cold-end temperature = 100 to 200 ºC) Heat pipe radiator (for up to 30 kW heat rejection) Radiation shield (reduce radiation down to 1E11 to 1E13 n/cm2 neutron fluence and 100 to 1000 kRad TID at minimum mass) Control electronics (capable of surviving the radiation environment that passes through the radiation shield)
NASA has plans to purchase services for delivery of payloads to the Moon through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contract. Under this subtopic, proposals may include efforts to develop payloads for flight demonstration of relevant technologies in the lunar environment.

",3 to 5,"Hardware, Analysis, and Research
","We are primarily looking for component and/or breadboard hardware to demonstrate concept feasibility in a lab or relevant environment. The appropriate research and analysis required to develop the hardware are also desired.
","Kilowatt-class fission power generation is an enabling technology for lunar and Mars surface missions that require day and night power for long-duration surface operations, and may be the only viable power option to achieve a sustained human presence. The surface assets that could benefit from a continuous and reliable fission power supply include landers, rover recharge stations, science platforms, mining equipment, ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization) propellant production, and crew habitats. Compared to solar arrays with energy storage, nuclear fission offers considerable mass savings, greater simplicity of deployment, improved environmental tolerance, and superior growth potential for increasing power demands. Fission power is also one of very few technologies that can be used on either the moon or Mars with the same basic design. A first-use on the moon provides an excellent proving ground for future Mars systems, on which the crew will be highly dependent for their survival and return propellant. The technology is also extensible to outer planet science missions with power requirements that exceed the capacity of radioisotope generators, including nuclear electric propulsion spacecraft that could enable certain science missions that might otherwise be impossible.
Current work on fission power systems has focused on a 1kWe design using a highly enriched Uranium-Molybdenum reactor core with a Beryllium oxide reflector. Depleted uranium, tungsten, and lithium hydride provide shielding of gamma rays and neutrons to the power conversion system, control electronics, payload, and habitat. Heat is removed from the core at approximately 800° C using sodium heat pipes and delivered to the power conversion system. Waste heat is removed from the power conversion system at approximately 100 to 200° C using water heat pipes coupled to aluminum or composite radiator panels.
Reliable, robust, and long life power conversion is highly desirable in fission systems. There are currently not enough vendors or enough long duration reliability data for power conversion technologies under these operating conditions and environments. More work is needed in this area to expand the supplier base, and to increase the TRL of power conversion technology. The reactor core must be isolated from the Martian environment to prevent oxidation. However, simply canning the core may not be an option since increased distance between the core and reflector can have large negative effects on system mass. Canning the reflector and core together is the simplest option; however, the increased temperature of the reflector results in reduced reactivity and increased mass. Innovations are necessary to provide isolation while reducing the negative effect due to the neutronics.
Total Ionizing Dose (TID) effects, Displacement Damage Dose (DDD) effects, and Single Event Effect (SEE) transients are well studied for the standard space radiation environment composed of charged particles and electromagnetic radiation of either solar or galactic origin. Aerospace electronics vendors offer high reliability product lines that have been qualified using standard irradiation testing procedures. These procedures do not typically cover the neutron environment of a nuclear fission reactor. Further qualification in a reactor radiation environment is needed for components and systems that will be used in a space fission power system.
","This technology directly aligns with the STMD roadmap for space power and energy storage. This technology could be infused into the Kilopower Project to enhance performance or reliability.

Focus Area 2 Power Energy and Storage,Z1.05Lunar & Planetary Surface Power Management & Distribution,"Innovative ways to transmit high power for lunar & Mars surface missions
","The Global Exploration Roadmap (January 2018) and the Space Policy Directive (December 2017) detail NASA’s plans for future human-rated space missions. A major factor in this involves establishing bases on the lunar surface and eventually Mars. Surface power for bases is envisioned to be located remotely from the habitat modules and must be efficiently transferred over significant distances. The International Space Station (ISS) has the highest power (100kW), and largest space power distribution system with eight interleaved micro-grids providing power functions similar to a terrestrial power utility. Planetary bases will be similar to the ISS with expectations of multiple power sources, storage, science, and habitation modules, but at higher power levels and with longer distribution networks providing interconnection. In order to enable high power (>100kW) and longer distribution systems on the surface of the moon or Mars, NASA is in need of innovative technologies in the areas of lower mass/higher efficiency power electronic regulators, switchgear, cabling, connectors, wireless sensors, power beaming, power scavenging, and power management control. The technologies of interest would need to operate in extreme temperature environments, including lunar night, and could experience temperature changes from -153C to 123C for lunar applications, and -125C to 80C for Mars bases. In addition to temperature extremes, technologies would need to withstand (have minimal degradation from) lunar dust/regolith, Mars dust storms, and space radiation levels.
While this subtopic would directly address the lunar and Mars base initiatives, technologies developed could also benefit other NASA Mission Directorates including SMD (Science Mission Directorate) and ARMD (Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate). Specific projects which could find value in the technologies developed herein include Gateway, In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), Advanced Modular Power Systems (AMPS), In-Space Electric Propulsion (ISP), planetary exploration, and Hybrid Gas Electric Propulsion. The power levels may be different, but the technology concepts could be similar, especially when dealing with temperature extremes and the need for electronics with higher power density and efficiency.
Specific technologies of interest would need to address the lunar or Mars environment, and include:
Application of wide bandgap electronics in DC-DC isolating converters with wide temperature (-70ºC to 150ºC), high power density (>2 kW/kg), high efficiency (>96%) power electronics and associated drivers for voltage regulation. Low mass, highly conductive wires and terminations that provide reliable small gauges for long distance power transmission in the 1-10kW range, low mass insulation materials with increased dielectric breakdown strength and void reductions with 600 V or greater ratings, and low loss/low mass shielding. Power beaming concepts to enable highly efficient flexible/mobile power transfer in the 100-1,000W range, including the fusion of power/communication/navigation.
(See Z13.02 - Dust Tolerant Mechanismssubtopic to propose power connection/termination related technologies that are impervious to environmental dust and enable robotic deployment, such as robotically-enabled high voltage connectors and/or near-field wireless power transfer in the 1-10kW range.)
",3 to 6,"Prototype, Analysis, Hardware, Research
","Typically, deliverables under Phase I proposals are geared towards a technology concept with associated analysis and design. A final report usually suffices in summarizing the work. Phase II hardware prototypes will have opportunities for infusion into NASA technology testbeds and commercial landers.
","While high power terrestrial distribution systems exist, there is no equivalent to a lunar or planetary base. Unique challenges must be overcome in order to enable a realistic power architecture for these future applications, especially when dealing with the environmental extremes which will be encountered. The temperature swings will be a critical requirement on any technology developed, from power converters to cabling or power beaming concepts. In addition, proposals will have to consider lunar regolith and Mars dust storms.
","This subtopic would directly address the lunar and Mars surface initiatives. There are potential infusion opportunities with SMD (Science Mission Directorate) Commercial Lander Payload Services and HEOMD (Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate) Flexible Lunar Exploration (FLEx) Landers.

Focus Area 2 Power Energy and Storage,"Z1.06Radiation tolerant high-voltage, high-power electronics",,"NASA’s directives for space exploration and habitation require high-performance, high-voltage transistors and diodes capable of operating without damage in the natural space radiation environment. Recently, significant progress has been made in the research community in understanding the mechanisms of heavy-ion radiation induced damage and catastrophic failure of wide bandgap power transistors and diodes. This subtopic seeks to facilitate movement of this understanding into the successful development of radiation-hardened high voltage transistors and rectifiers to meet NASA mission power needs reliably in the space environment. These needs include:
High-voltage, high-power solutions: Technology Area (TA) 3.3.3, Power Management and Distribution (PMAD) Distribution and Transmission calls out the need for development of radiation-hardened, high-voltage, extreme- temperature components for power distribution systems. NASA has a core need for diodes and transistors that meet the following specifications: Diodes: minimum 1200 V, 40 A, with fast recovery < 50 ns; Transistors: minimum 600 V, 40 A, with < 24 mohm on-state drain-source resistance. High-voltage, low-power solutions: In support of TA 8.1 (Remote Sensing Instruments and Sensors), radiation-hardened, high-voltage transistors are needed for low-mass, low-leakage, high-efficiency applications such as LIDAR Q-switch drivers, mass spectrometers, and electrostatic analyzers. High-voltage, fast-recovery diodes are needed to enhance performance of a variety of heliophysics and planetary science instruments. Transistors: minimum 1000 V, < 40 ns rise and fall times; Diodes: 2 kV to 5 kV, < 50 ns recovery time. High-voltage, low- to medium-power solutions: In support of peak-power solar tracking systems for planetary spacecraft and small satellites, transistors and diodes are needed to increase buck converter efficiencies through faster switching speeds. Transistors: minimum 600 V, < 50 ns rise and fall times, current ranging from low to > 20 A.
Successful proposal concepts should result in the fabrication of transistors and/or diodes that meet or exceed the above performance specifications without susceptibility to damage due to the heavy-ion space radiation environment (single-event effects resulting in permanent degradation or catastrophic failure). These diodes and/or transistors will form the basis of innovative, high-efficiency, low mass and volume systems and therefore must significantly improve upon the electrical performance available from existing heavy-ion radiation-tolerant devices. Proposals must state the initial state of the art for the proposed technology and justify the expected final performance metrics. Well-developed plans for validating the tolerance to heavy-ion radiation must be included, and the expected total ionizing dose tolerance should be indicated and justified. Target radiation performance levels will depend upon the device structure due to the interaction of the high electric field with the ionizing particle:
For vertical-field power devices: No heavy-ion induced permanent destructive effects upon irradiation while in blocking configuration (in powered reverse-bias/off state) with ions having a silicon-equivalent surface incident Linear Energy Transfer (LET) of 40 MeV-cm2/mg and sufficient energy maintain a rising LET level throughout the epitaxial layer(s). For all other devices: No heavy-ion induced permanent destructive effects upon irradiation while in blocking configuration (in powered reverse-bias/off state) with ions having a silicon-equivalent surface-incident Linear Energy Transfer (LET) of 75 MeV-cm2/mg and sufficient energy to fully penetrate the active volume prior to the ions reaching their maximum LET value (Bragg peak).
Other innovative heavy-ion radiation-tolerant high-power, high-voltage discrete device technologies will be considered that offer significant electrical performance improvement over state-of-the art heavy-ion radiation-tolerant power devices.
",5 to 6,"Prototype, Analysis, Hardware
","Deliverables in Phase II shall include prototype and/or production-ready semiconductor devices (diodes and/or transistors), device electrical and radiation performance characterization (device electrical performance specifications and heavy-ion radiation test results and total dose radiation analyses).
","A prior version of this subtopic, ""High-Power, High-Voltage Electronics"" was active in 2016-2017 and paused for two years to give time for funded proposals and a similar Early Stage Innovation topic designed to understand the radiation-induced failure mechanisms in wide bandgap semiconductors to mature. This pause has allowed these studies to mature and it is now time to re-open this subtopic to provide a means for applying the knowledge gained toward fabrication of radiation hardened power devices that are tailored to meet performance criteria of a number of NASA technology needs.
High voltage silicon power devices are limited in current ratings and have limited power efficiency and higher losses than do commercial Wide Bandgap (WBG) power devices. Efforts to space-qualify WBG power devices to take advantage of their tremendous performance advantages revealed they are very susceptible to damage from the heavy ion space radiation environment (galactic cosmic rays) that cannot be shielded against. Higher voltage devices are more susceptible to these effects; as a result, to date, there are space qualified GaN (Gallium Nitride) transistors now available but these are limited to 300 V. Recent radiation testing of 600 V and higher GaN transistors have shown failure susceptibility at about 50% of the rated voltage, or less. Silicon carbide power devices have undergone several generation advances commercially, improving their overall reliability, but catastrophically fail at less than 50% of their rated voltage. NASA has funded modeling and experimental efforts to understand the silicon carbide's susceptibility to heavy-ion radiation. Re-opening of this topic will provide a path for development and fabrication of hardened designs based upon this research, and encourage progress in other wide bandgap technologies such as higher voltage GaN, gallium oxide, and possibly diamond.
Specific needs in STMD (Space Technology Mission Directorate) and SMD (Science Mission Directorate) areas have been identified for spacecraft PMAD and science instrument power applications and device performance requirements to meet these needs are included in this subtopic nomination. In all cases, there is no alternative solution that can provide the mass and power savings sought to enable game-changing capability. Current PPUs (Power Processing Unit's) and instrument power systems rely on older silicon technology with many stacked devices and efficiency penalties. In NASA's move to do more with less (smaller satellites), the technology of this subtopic nomination is truly enabling.
A phase I funded SBIR under the S4.04 Extreme Environments Technology, was awarded (https://sbir.nasa.gov/SBIR/abstracts/19/sbir/phase1/SBIR-19-1-S4.04-3611...) in 2019 to develop low-defect gallium oxide (Ga2O3) based high-voltage power diodes grown on commercially available bulk Ga2O3 substrates via a thin-film deposition technique. The S4.04 Subtopic Manager serves as a participating subtopic manager on this Z1 subtopic to foster good leveraging and to avoid duplication of efforts. The S4.04 subtopic solicits development of technology for extreme temperatures and high total ionizing dose radiation primarily.
Other non-NASA funded efforts include:
Vertical GaN diode development has been a focus of ARPA-E PNDIODE and (previous) SWITCHES programs. Diodes developed under the SWITCHES program were shown by Sandia National Lab to have good switching reliability, but another Italian team has found they may degrade under high current stress. Heavy-ion radiation susceptibility has not been assessed and is not expected to be robust without design alteration.
DoD (Department of Defense) has two funded Ga2O3 technology SBIRs that focus on development of manufacturing capabilities as opposed to device design itself.
","Power transistors and diodes form the building blocks of numerous power circuits for spacecraft and science instrument applications. This subtopic therefore feeds a broad array of space technology hardware development activities by providing single-event effect (heavy ion) radiation-hardened state-of-the-art device technologies that achieve higher voltages with lower power consumption and greater efficiency than presently available.
TA 3.3.3, Power Management and Distribution (PMAD) Distribution and Transmission calls out the need for development of radiation-hardened, high-voltage, extreme-temperature components for power distribution systems. This subtopic will serve as a feeder to the subtopic Z1.05 - Lunar & Planetary Surface Power Management & Distribution"" in which wide bandgap circuits for PMAD applications are solicited. The solicited developments in this subtopic will also feed systems development for Kilopower due to the savings in size/mass combined with radiation hardness. In addition, power distribution for lunar and Martian habitats will benefit from power circuits adopting this subtopic through significantly improved power efficiencies and radiation hardness.
TA 8.1, Remote Sensing Instruments and Sensors, radiation-hardened, high-voltage transistors are needed for low-mass, low-leakage, high-efficiency applications such as LIDAR Q-switch drivers, mass spectrometers, and electrostatic analyzers. These applications are aligned with science objectives including Earth Science LIDAR needs, Jovian moon exploration, and Saturn missions. Finally, mass spectrometers critical to planetary and asteroid research and in the search for life on other planets such as Mars require high voltage power systems and will thus benefit from mass and power savings from this subtopic's innovations.

Focus Area 3 Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration,H6.22Deep Neural Net and Neuromorphic Processors for In-Space Autonomy and Cognition,"Neuromorphic Capabilities
","The Neuromorphic Processors for In-Space Autonomy and Cognition subtopic specifically focuses on advances in signal and data processing. Neuromorphic processing will enable NASA to meet growing demands for applying artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms on-board a spacecraft to optimize and automate operations. This includes enabling cognitive systems to improve mission communication and data processing capabilities, enhance computing performance, and reduce memory requirements. Neuromorphic processors can enable a spacecraft to sense, adapt, act and learn from its experiences and from the unknown environment without necessitating involvement from a mission operations team. Additionally, this processing architecture shows promise for addressing the power requirements that traditional computing architectures now struggle to meet in space applications.
The goal of this program is to develop neuromorphic processing software, hardware, algorithms, architectures, simulators and techniques as enabling capability for autonomous space operations. Emerging memristor and other radiation-tolerant devices, which shows potential for addressing the need for energy efficient neuromorphic processors and improved signal processing capability, is of particular interest due to its resistance to the effects of radiation.
Additional areas of interest for research and/or technology development include: a) spiking algorithms that learn from the environment and improve operations, b) neuromorphic processing approaches to enhance data processing, computing performance, and memory conservation, and c) new brain-inspired chips and breakthroughs in machine understanding/intelligence. Novel memristor approaches which show promise for space applications are also sought.
This subtopic seeks innovations focusing on low size, weight and power (SWaP) applications suitable lunar orbital or surface operations, enabling efficient on-board processing at lunar distances. Focusing on SWaP-constrained platforms opens up the potential for applying neuromorphic processors in spacecraft or robotic control situations traditionally reserved for power-hungry general purpose processors. This technology will allow for increased speed, energy efficiency and higher performance for computing in unknown and un-characterized space environments including the Moon and Mars.
Phase I will emphasize research aspects for technical feasibility and show a path toward a Phase II proposal. Phase I deliverables include concept of operations of the research topic, simulations and preliminary results. Early development and delivery of prototype hardware/software is encouraged.
Phase II will emphasize hardware and/or software development with delivery of specific hardware and/or software products for NASA, targeting demonstration operations on a low-SWaP platform. Phase II deliverables include a working prototype of the proposed product and/or software, along with documentation and tools necessary for NASA to use the product and/or modify and use the software. In order to enable mission deployment, proposed prototypes should include a path, preferably demonstrated, for fault tolerance and mission tolerance.
",4 to 6,"Prototype, Hardware, Software
","Phase 2 deliverables should include hardware/software necessary to show how the advances made in the development can be applied to a cubesat, small sat, and rover flight demonstration.
","The current State-of-the-Art (SOA) for in-space processing is the High Performance Spaceflight Computing (HPSC) processor being developed by Boeing for NASA GSFC. The HPSC, called the Chiplet, contains 8 general purpose processing cores in a dual quad-core configuration. Delivery is expected by December 2022. In a submission to the STMD Game Changing Development (GCD) program, the highest computational capability required by a typical space mission is 35-70 GFLOPS (million fast logical operations per second).
The current SOA does not address the capabilities required for artificial intelligence and machine-learning applications in the space environment. These applications require significant amounts of multiply and accumulate operations, in addition to a substantial amount of memory to store data and retain intermediate states in a neural network computation. Terrestrially, these operations require General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GP-GPUs), which are capable of teraflops (TFLOPS) each -- approximately 3 orders of magnitude above the anticipated capabilities of the HPSC.
Neuromorphic processing offers the potential to bridge this gap through a novel hardware approach. Existing research in the area shows neuromorphic processors to be up to 1000 times more energy efficient than GP-GPUs in artificial intelligence applications. Obviously the true performance depends on the application, but nevertheless the architecture has demonstrated characteristics that make it well-adapted to the space environment.
","The Cognitive Communications Project, through the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Program, is one potential customer of work from this subtopic area. Neuromorphic processors are a key enabler to the cognitive radio and system architecture envisioned by this project. As communications become more complex, cognition and automation will play a larger role to mitigate complexity and reduce operations costs. Machine learning will choose radio configurations, adjust for impairments and failures. Neuromorphic processors will address the power requirements that traditional computing architectures now struggle to meet and are of relevance to lunar return and Mars for autonomous operations, as well as of interest to HEOMD and SMD for in-situ avionics capabilities.

Focus Area 3 Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration,S5.05Fault Management Technologies,"Development, Design, and Implementation of Fault Management Technologies
Scope Description
NASA’s science program has well over 100 spacecraft in operation, formulation, or development, generating science data accessible to researchers everywhere. As science missions have increasingly complex goals, often on compressed timetables, and have more pressure to reduce operations costs, system autonomy must increase in response.Fault Management (FM) is a key component of system autonomy, serving to detect, interpret, and mitigate failures that threaten mission success. Robust FM must address the full range of hardware failures, but also must consider failure of sensors or the flow of sensor data, harmful or unexpected system interaction with the environment, and problems due to faults in software or incorrect control inputs -- including failure of autonomy components themselves.Despite a wealth of lessons learned from past missions, spacecraft failures are still not uncommon and reuse of FM approaches is very limited, illustrating deficiencies our approach to handling faults in all phases of the flight project lifecycle. While this subtopic addresses particular interest in on-board Fault Management capabilities (viz. on-board sensing approaches, computing, algorithms, and models to assess and maintain spacecraft health), the goal isto provide a
system capability
, and thus off-board components such as modeling techniques and tools, development environments, testbeds, and verification and validation (V&V) technologies are also relevant. Specific algorithms and sensor technologies are in scope provided their impact is not limited to a particular subsystem, mission goal, or failure mechanism.Innovations in Fault Management can be grouped into the categories below.",,,,,"Many recent Science Mission Directorate (SMD) missions have encountered major cost overruns and schedule slips due to difficulty in implementing, testing, and verifying FM functions. These overruns are invariably caused by a lack of understanding of FM functions at early stages in mission development, and by FM architectures that are not sufficiently transparent, verifiable, or flexible enough to provide needed isolation capability or coverage. In addition, a substantial fraction of SMD missions continue to experience failures with significant mission impact, highlighting the need for better FM understanding early in the design cycle, more comprehensive and more accurate FM techniques, and more operational flexibility in response to failures provided by better visibility into failures and system performance. Furthermore, SMD increasingly selects missions with significant operations challenges, setting expectations for FM to evolve into more capable, faster-reacting, and more reliable on-board systems.The SBIR program is an appropriate venue due to the following factors","FM technologies are applicable to all SMD missions, albeit with different emphases. Medium to large missions have very low tolerance for risk of mission failure, leading to a need for sophisticated and comprehensive fault management. Small missions, on the other hand, have a higher tolerance for risks to mission success but must be highly efficient, and are increasingly adopting autonomy and FM as a risk mitigation strategy.A few examples are provided below, although these may be generalized to a broad class of missionsLunar Flashlight Enable very low-cost operations and high science return from a 6U cubesat through on-board error detection and mitigation, streamlining mission operations. Provide autonomous resilience to on-board errors and disturbances that interrupt or interfere with science observations.Europa Clipper Provide on-board capability to detect and correct radiation-induced execution errors. Provide reliable reasoning capability to restart observations after interruptions without requiring ground in-the-loop. Provide MBSE tools to model and analyze FM capabilities in support of design trades, V&V of FM capabilities, and coordinated development with flight software.Rovers and Rotorcraft (Mars Sample Return, Dragonfly) Provide on-board capability for systems checkout, enabling lengthy drives/flights between Earth contacts and mobility after environmentally-induced anomalies (e.g., unexpected terrain interaction). Improve reliability of complex activities (e.g., navigation to features, drilling and sample capture, capsule pickup and remote launch).Search for Extrasolar Planets (Observation) Provide sufficient system reliability through on-board detection, reasoning, and response to enable long-period, stable observations. Provide on-board or on-ground analysis capabilities to predict system response and optimize observation schedule. Enable reliable operations while out of direct contact (e.g., deliberately occluded from Earth to reduce photon, thermal, and radio frequency background).","NASA's approach to Fault Management and the various needs are summarized in the NASA FM Handbook (

Desired Deliverables of Phase II
Prototype, Analysis, Software
Desired Deliverables Description
The aim of the Phase I project should be to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the proposed innovation and thereby bring the innovation closer to commercialization. Note, however, the R&D undertaken in Phase I is intended to have high technical risk, and so it is expected that not all projects will achieve the desired technical outcomes.The required deliverable at the end of an SBIR Phase I contract is a report that summarizes the project’s technical accomplishments. As noted above, it is intended that proposed efforts conduct an initial proof of concept, after which successful efforts would be considered for follow-on funding by SMD missions as risk-reduction and infusion activities. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and NASA relevance during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration.The Final Report should thoroughly document the innovation, its status at the end of the effort, and as much objective evaluation of its strengths and weaknesses as is practical. The report should include a description of the approach, foundational concepts and operating theory, mathematical basis, and requirements for application. Results should include strengths and weaknesses found, measured performance in tests where possible.Additional deliverables may significantly clarify the value and feasibility of the innovation. These deliverables should be planned to demonstrate retirement of development risk, increasing maturity, and targeted applications of particular interest. While the wide range of innovations precludes a specific list, some possible deliverables are listed below",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Focus Area 3 Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration,T4.03Coordination and Control of Swarms of Space Vehicles,"Enabling Technologies for Swarm of Space Vehicles
","This subtopic is focused on developing and demonstrating technologies that enable cooperative operation of swarms of space vehicles in a dynamic environment. Primary interest is in technologies appropriate for low-cardinality (4-15 vehicle) swarms of small spacecraft, as well as planetary rovers and flyers (e.g., Mars helicopter). Large swarms and other platforms are of interest if well motivated in connection to NASA’s strategic plan and needs identified in decadal surveys.
The proposed technology should be motivated by a well-defined design reference mission presented in the proposal.
Possible areas of interest include but are not limited to:
High precision relative localization and time synchronization in orbit and on planet surface. Coordinated task planning, operation, and execution with realistic communication limitations. Fast, real-time, coordinated motion planning in areas densely crowded by other agents and obstacles. Operations concepts and tools that provide situational awareness and commanding capability for a team of spacecraft or swarm of robots on another planet. Communication-less coordination by observing and estimating the actions of other agents in the multi-agent system. Cooperative manipulation and in-space construction Cooperative information gathering and estimation for exploration and inspection of a target object (large space structure or small asteroid).
Phase I awards will be expected to develop theoretical frameworks, algorithms, software simulation and demonstrate feasibility (TRL 2-3). Phase II awards will be expected to demonstrate capability on a hardware testbed (TRL 4-6).
NASA has plans to purchase services for delivery of payloads to the Moon through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contract. Under this subtopic, proposals may include efforts to develop payloads for flight demonstration of relevant technologies in the lunar environment. The CLPS payload accommodations will vary depending on the particular service provider and mission characteristics. Additional information on the CLPS program and providers can be found at this link: https://www.nasa.gov/content/commercial-lunar-payload-services. CLPS missions will typically carry multiple payloads for multiple customers. Smaller, simpler, and more self-sufficient payloads are more easily accommodated and would be more likely to be considered for a NASA-sponsored flight opportunity. Commercial payload delivery services may begin as early as 2020 and flight opportunities are expected to continue well into the future. In future years it is expected that larger and more complex payloads will be accommodated. Selection for award under this solicitation will not guarantee selection for a lunar flight opportunity.

","Algorithms and research results clearly depicting metrics and performance of the developed technology in comparison to state of the art (SOA). Software implementation of the developed solution along with simulation platform. Prototype of the sensor or similar if proposal is to develop such subsystem.

These technologies also enable successful formation flying spacecraft for multi-spacecraft synthetic aperture radar and interferometry (distributed space telescope) purposes, a team of smallsats forming a convoy which the lead triggers detailed measurements on the following spacecraft of a phenomena identified by the lead, or a team of smallsats collaboratively manipulating a defunct spacecraft or small asteroid.

Multi-robot follow-on to the Mars 2020 and Mars Helicopter programs are likely to necessitate close collaboration among flying robots as advance scouts and rovers. Pop-Up Flat-Folding Explorer Robots (PUFFERs) are being developed at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and promise a low-cost swarm of networked robots that can collaboratively explore lava-tubes and other hard to reach areas on planet surfaces. A convoy of spacecraft is being considered, in which the lead spacecraft triggers detailed measurement of a very dynamic event by the following spacecraft.
Multiple concepts for distributed space telescopes and distributed synthetic apertures are proposed that rely heavily on coordination and control technologies developed under this subtopic.

Focus Area 3 Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration,T4.04Autonomous Systems and Operations for the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway,"Artificial Intelligence for the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway
","The Gateway is a planned lunar-orbit spacecraft that will have a power and propulsion system, a small habitat for the crew, a docking capability, an airlock and logistics modules. The Gateway is expected to serve as an intermediate way station between the Orion crew capsule and lunar landers as well as a platform for both crewed and un-crewed experiments. The Gateway is also intended to test technologies and operational procedures for suitability on long-duration space missions such as a mission to Mars. As such, it will require new technologies such as autonomous systems to run scientific experiments onboard, including biological experiments; perform system health management, including caution and warning; autonomous data management and other functions. In contrast to the International Space Station, Gateway is much more representative of lunar and deep-space missions---for example, the radiation environment.
This subtopic solicits autonomy, artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to manage and operate engineered systems to facilitate long-duration space missions, with the goal of testing proposed technologies on Gateway. The current concept of operations for Gateway anticipates un-crewed (dormant) periods of up to nine months. Technologies need to be capable of or enable long-term, mostly unsupervised, autonomous operation. While crew are present, technologies need to augment the crew’s abilities and allow more autonomy from Earth-based Mission Control. Additionally, the technologies may need to allow for coordination with the Orion crew capsule, lunar landers, Earth and their various systems and subsystems.
Examples of needs include but are not limited to:
Autonomous operations and tending of science payloads including environmental monitoring and support for live biological samples, and in-situ automated analysis of science experiments. Prioritizing data for transmission from the Gateway. Given communications limitations, it may be necessary to determine what data can be stored for transmission when greater bandwidth is available, and what data can be eliminated as it will turn out to be useless, based on criteria relevant to the conduct of science and/or maintenance of the physical assets. Alternatively, it may be useful to adaptively compress data for transmission from the Gateway, which could include scientific experiment data and status, voice communications, scientific experiment data and status, and/or systems health management data. Autonomous operations and health management of the Gateway. When Gateway is unoccupied, unexpected events or faults may require immediate autonomous detection and response, demonstrating this capability in the absence of support from Mission Control (which is enabling for future Mars missions and time-critical responses in lunar environment as well). Efforts to develop smart habitats will allow long-term human presence on the moon and Mars, such as the Space Technology Research Institutes (https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-two-new-space-tech-research-institutes-for-smart-habitats) are relevant.
",2 to 6,"Prototype, Analysis, Software, Hardware, Research
","The deliverables range from research results to prototypes demonstrating various ways that autonomy and artificial intelligence (e.g., automated reasoning, machine learning, and discrete control) can be applied to aspects of Gateway operations and health management individually and/or jointly. As one example, for autonomous biological science experiments, the prototype could include hardware to host live samples for a minimum of 30 days that provide monitoring and environmental maintenance, as well as software to autonomously remedy issues with live science experiments. As another example, software that monitors the gateway habitat while un-crewed, automatically notifies of any off-nominal conditions, and then, when crew arrive, transitions the gateway from quiescent status to a status capable of providing the crew with life support. As another example, machine learning from the data stream of Gateway sensors to determine anomalous vs. nominal conditions and prioritize and compress data communications to Earth.
Phase 1 deliverables minimally include a detailed concept for autonomy technology to support Gateway operations such as experiments. Prototypes of software and/or hardware are strongly encouraged. Phase 2 deliverables will be full technology prototypes that could be subsequently matured for deployment on Gateway. Coordination with related efforts, such as the Space Technology Research Institutes (https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-two-new-space-tech-research-institutes-for-smart-habitats) is expected to eliminate redundancy of effort and allow appropriate interactions between Gateway and smart habitats.
","The current state-of-the-art in human spaceflight allows for autonomous operations of systems of relatively limited scope, involving only a fixed level of autonomy (e.g., amount of human involvement needed), and learning at most one type of function (e.g., navigation). The Gateway will require all operations and health management to be autonomous at different levels (almost fully autonomous when no astronauts are on board vs. limited autonomy when astronauts are present), will require the autonomy to learn from human operations, and will require autonomy across all functions. The autonomy will also need to adapt to new missions and new technologies.
As NASA continues to expand with the eventual goal of Mars missions, the need for autonomous tending of science payloads will grow substantially. In order to address the primary health concerns for crew on these missions, it is necessary to conduct science in the most relevant environment. Acquisition of this type of data will be challenging while the gateway and Artemis missions are being performed due to limited crewed missions and limited crew time.
","Gateway and other space station-like assets in the future will need: The ability to learn autonomous operations from human operations which will be critical as the assets are expected to operate increasingly autonomously due to increasing duration space missions such as missions to Mars.

Focus Area 4 Robotic Systems for Space Exploration,"S4.02Robotic Mobility, Manipulation and Sampling","Robotic Mobility, Manipulation and Sampling
","Technologies for robotic mobility, manipulation, and sampling are needed to enable access to sites of interest and acquisition and handling of samples for in-situ analysis or return to Earth from planets and small planetary bodies. The Moon and planetary moons with liquid oceans are of particular interest, as well as Mars, comets, and asteroids.
Mobility technologies are needed to enable access to steep and rough terrain for planetary bodies where gravity dominates, such as Earth’s moon and Mars. Wheeled, legged, and aerial solutions are of interest. Wheel concepts with good tractive performance in loose sand while being robust to harsh rocky terrain are of interest. Technologies to enable mobility on small bodies and access to liquid below the surface (e.g., in conduits or deep oceans) are desired, as well as the associated sampling technologies. Manipulation technologies are needed to deploy sampling tools to the surface, transfer samples to in-situ instruments and sample storage containers, and hermetically seal sample chambers. Sample acquisition tools are needed to acquire samples on planetary and small bodies through soft and hard materials, including ice. Minimization of mass and ability to work reliably in the harsh mission environment are important characteristics for the tools. Finally, design for planetary protection and contamination control is important for sample acquisition and handling systems.
Component technologies for low-mass and low-power systems tolerant to the in-situ environment, e.g. temperature, radiation, and dust, are of particular interest. Technical feasibility should be demonstrated during Phase I and a full capability unit of at least TRL 4 should be delivered in Phase II. Proposals should show an understanding of relevant science needs and engineering constraints and present a feasible plan to fully develop a technology and infuse it into a NASA program. Specific areas of interest include the following:
Surface mobility and sampling systems for planets, small bodies, and moons Near subsurface sampling tools such as icy surface drills to 30 cm depth deployed from a manipulator Subsurface ocean access such as via a deep drill system Sample handling technologies that minimize cross contamination and preserve mechanical integrity of samples Pneumatic sample transfer systems and particle flow measurement sensors Low mass/power vision systems and processing capabilities that enable fast surface traverse Active lighting stereo systems for landers and rovers Electro-mechanical connectors enabling tool change-out in dirty environments Tethers and tether play-out and retrieval systems Miniaturized flight motor controllers Cryogenic operation actuators Robotic arms for low gravity environments
Proposers should also note a related subtopic exists that is focused solely on lunar robotic missions (see Z5.05, Lunar Rover Technologies for In-Situ Resource Utilization and Exploration), under the Space Technology Mission Directorate). With NASA's present emphasis on lunar exploration, Z5.05 is provided to help develop innovative lunar rover technologies to support in-situ resource utilization activities and for developing ideas, subsystem components, software tools, and prototypes that contribute to more capable and/or lower cost lunar robots. In particular, cryogenic or cryo-capable actuators that are specifically for lunar rover applications should be directed towards Z5.05.

","Scoops, powder drills, and rock core drills and their corresponding handling systems have been developed for sample acquisition on Mars and asteroids. Non-flight systems have been developed for sampling on comets, Venus, and Earth's moon. However, these have not been incorporated in a robotic mission, and the lack of a sufficient solution or technology readiness level is in some cases the reason a mission has not yet been possible. Exploration of icy ocean worlds is in the concept phase and associated sampling and sample handling systems do not exist.
","The subtopic supports multiple programs within Science Mission Directorate (SMD). The Mars program has had infusion of technologies such as a force-torque sensor in the Mars 2020 mission. Recent awards would support the Ocean Worlds program: surface and deep drills for Europa. Products from this subtopic have been proposed for New Frontiers program missions. With renewed interest in return to Earth's moon, the mobility and sampling technologies could support future robotic missions to the moon.

Focus Area 4 Robotic Systems for Space Exploration,T4.01Information Technologies for Intelligent and Adaptive Space Robotics,"Develop Information Technologies to Improve Space Robots.
","Extensive and pervasive use of robots can significantly enhance space exploration and space science, particularly for missions that are progressively longer, complex, and distant. The performance of these robots is directly linked to the quality and capability of the information technologies used to build and operate them. With few exceptions, however, current information technology used for state-of-the-art robotics is designed only to meet the needs of terrestrial applications and environments.
The objective of this subtopic, therefore, is to encourage the adaptation, maturation, and retargeting of terrestrial information technologies for space robotics. Proposals should address at least one of the following research areas:
",4 to 6,,,"Future exploration and science missions will require robots to operate in more difficult environments, carry out more complex tasks, and handle more dynamic and varying operational constraints than the current state of the art, which relies on low-performance, rad-hard computing and execution of pre-planned command sequences. To achieve these capabilities, numerous new information technologies need to be developed, including high performance space computing, autonomy algorithms, and advanced robot software systems (on-board and off-board).
For example, in contrast to the International Space Station, which is continuously manned, the Gateway is expected to only be intermittently occupied – perhaps as little as 8% of the time. Consequently, there is a significant need for the facility to be robotically tended, in order to maintain and repair systems in the absence of human crew. These robots will perform a wide range of caretaking work including inspection, monitoring, routine maintenance, and contingency handling. To do this, significant advances will need to be made in autonomous perception and robot user interfaces, particularly to handle mission-critical and safety-critical operations.
As another example, a mission to explore and map interior oceans beneath the ice on Europa will require a robot to penetrate an unknown thickness of ice, autonomously carry out a complex set of activities, and navigate back to the surface in order to transmit data back to Earth. The robot will need to perform these tasks with minimal human involvement and while operating in an extremely harsh and dynamic environment. To do this, significant advances will need to be made in autonomous perception and on-board software, particularly to compensate for poor (bandwidth-limited, high-latency, intermittent) communications and the need for high performance autonomy.
","The development of information technology for intelligent and adaptive space robotics is well aligned with NASA goals for robotics. In particular, this development directly addresses multiple areas (TA4, TA7, TA11) of the 2015 NASA technology roadmap. Additionally, this development is directly aligned with multiple portions of the NASA Autonomous Systems SCLT (Systems Capability Leadership Team) technology taxonomy. Moreover, this development directly addresses a core technology area (robotics and autonomous systems) of the NASA Strategic Space Technology Investment Plan. Finally, the technology is directly aligned with the needs of numerous projects and programs in Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD), Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD), Science Mission Directorate (SMD), and Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD).
ARMD: The technology can be applied to a broad range of unmanned aerial systems (UAS), including both small-scale drones and Predator / Global Hawk type systems. The technology can also be potentially infused into other flight systems that include autonomous capabilities, such as Urban Air Mobility vehicles. HEOMD: The technology is directly relevant to ""caretaker"" robots, which are needed to monitor and maintain human spacecraft (such as the Gateway) during dormant/uncrewed periods. The technology can also be used by precursor lunar robots to perform required exploration work prior to the arrival of humans on the Moon. SMD: The technology is required for future missions in Earth Science, Heliophysics, and Planetary Science (including the Moon, icy moons and ocean worlds) that require higher performance and autonomy than currently possible. In particular, missions that must operate in dynamic environments, or measure varying phenomena, will require the technology developed by this subtopic. STMD: The technology is directly applicable to numerous current mid-TRL (Game Changing Development program) and high-TRL (Technology Demonstration Mission program) Research and Development (R&D) activities, including Astrobee, In-space Robotic Manufacturing and Assembly, etc.

Focus Area 4 Robotic Systems for Space Exploration,Z5.04Technologies for Intra-Vehicular Activity Robotics,"Improve the capability or performance of intravehicular activity robots
","To support human exploration beyond Earth orbit, NASA is preparing to develop the ""Gateway"", which will be an orbiting facility near the Moon. This facility would serve as a starting point for missions to cis-lunar space and beyond. This facility could enable assembly and servicing of telescopes and deep-space exploration vehicles. This facility could also be used as a platform for astrophysics, Earth observation, heliophysics, and lunar science.
In contrast to the ISS (International Space Station), which is continuously manned, the Gateway is expected to only be intermittently occupied by humans – perhaps only 1 month per year. Consequently, there is a significant need for the Gateway to have autonomous capabilities for performing payload operations and spacecraft caretaking, particularly when astronauts are not present. Intra-Vehicular Activity (IVA) robots can potentially perform a wide variety of tasks including systems inspection, monitoring, diagnostics and repair, logistics and consumables stowage, exploration capability testing, aggregation of robotically returned destination surface samples, and science measurements and ops.
The objective of this subtopic, therefore, is to develop technologies that can improve the capability or performance of IVA robots to perform payload operations and spacecraft caretaking. Proposals are specifically sought to create technologies that can be integrated and tested with the NASA Astrobee or Robonaut 2 robots in the following areas: (1) Sensors and perception systems for interior environment monitoring, inspection, modeling and navigation; (2) Robotic tools for manipulating logistics and stowage or performing maintenance, housekeeping or emergency management operations (e.g. fire detection & suppression in multiple constrained locations or cleaning lunar dust out of HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters; and (3) Operational subsystems that enable extended robot operations (power systems, efficient propulsion, etc.), increase robot autonomy (planning, scheduling, and task execution), or improve human-robot teaming (software architecture, remote operations methods, etc.).

","Prototype components or subsystems. Proposals must describe how the technology will make a significant improvement over the current state of the art, rather than just an incremental enhancement, for a specific IVA robot application.
","The technology developed by this subtopic would both enable and enhance the Astrobee free-flying robot and Robonaut 2 humanoid robot, which are the SOA for IVA robots. SBIR technology would improve the capability and performance of these robots to routinely and robustly perform IVA tasks, particularly internal spacecraft payload operations and logistics. New technology created by 2020 SBIR awards can be tested with these robots in ground testbeds at ARC and JSC during the SBIR period of performance. On-orbit testing on ISS may be possible during Phase 2 and beyond (Phase 2-E, 2-X, 3, etc.).
The technology developed by this subtopic would also fill technical gaps identified by the proposed GCD (Game Changing Development) ""Integrated System for Autonomous and Adaptive Caretaking"" (ISAAC) project, which will mature autonomy technology to support the caretaking of human exploration spacecraft. In particular, the SBIR technology would help provide autonomy and robotic capabilities that are required for in-flight maintenance (both preventive and corrective) of Gateway during extended periods when crew are not present.

Focus Area 4 Robotic Systems for Space Exploration,Z5.05Lunar Rover Technologies for In-situ Resource Utilization and Exploration,"Enabling Rover Technologies for Lunar Missions
","The objective of this subtopic is to innovate lunar rover technologies that will enable In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) and exploration missions. In particular, this subtopic will develop ideas, subsystems components, software tools, and prototypes that contribute to more capable and/or lower-cost lunar robots.
A potential lunar ISRU application is the prospecting, characterization, and collection of volatiles that could be processed to produce oxygen, fuel, etc. Recent remote sensing measurements, modeling, and data from LCROSS (Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite) indicates that there may be an abundance of volatiles (e.g., hydrogen) near the lunar poles. However, the distribution of the volatiles at and under the surface is unknown. The Lunar Rover Technologies for In-situ Resource Utilization and Exploration subtopic seeks new robotic technology that will enable rover technologies for lunar missions to support ISRU activities. This does not include new ISRU technology (which is solicited by subtopics T2.05 - Advanced Concepts for Lunar and Martian Propellant Production, Storage, Transfer, and Usage for the STTR solicitation and S4.02 - Robotic Mobility, Manipulation and Sampling for the SBIR solicitation).
The expected environment at the lunar poles involves all the challenges observed during the Apollo mission (thermal extremes, vacuum, radiation, abrasive dust, electrostatic dust) plus the addition of low sun angles, potentially less consolidated regolith, and permanently shadowed regions with temperatures as low as 40K. This subtopic seeks new technology to address these challenges.
Phase I success involves technical feasibility demonstration through analysis, prototyping, proof-of-concept, or testing. Phase II success will advance TRL to a level of 4-5. Of specific interest are:
Mobility architectures, including novel mobility mechanisms and lunar dust tolerant mechanisms. Cryo-capable actuators capable of operating at extremely cold temperatures (in environments as cold as -230C).Preferably solutions will not include heaters as they significantly increase the power draw for normal operations during the lunar day.Novel materials capable of maintaining metallurgical properties at cryogenic temperatures will be considered.Also desired are cryo actuators featuring dust tolerances and the ability to operate at high temperatures as well (approaching 150C). Magnetic gearing applications for space. NASA and others are developing relatively low ratio (less than 25:1 per stage) concentric magnetic gearing for aeronautics applications. Space applications demand high speed-reduction ratio (often more than 1000:1) and high specific torque (>50 Nm/kg), operation in environmental temperatures down to -230C (40K), operation in low-atmosphere or hard vacuum, with high reliability and energy efficiency. Phase I work would include identifying the most suitable magnetic gear topologies to meet these space application needs, defining the technology development challenges including thermal and structural issues, advancing the most critical aspects of the technology, and producing a low-fidelity prototype to prove the feasibility of the concept(s). Perception systems and algorithms with a path toward flight for the lunar surface capable of operating in the harsh lighting conditions that might include high dynamic range, shadowed regions, low angle illumination, and opposition effects Lunar regolith terramechanical modeling tools and simulations, especially tools that integration with existing commercial and open source robotic analysis and simulation tools. Rover embedding and entrapment detection and escape approaches including slip monitoring, regolith sensing/modeling, low ground pressure wheels and soft soil tolerant mobility architectures.
For all the above, it is desired to have been demonstrated in, or have a clear path to operating in, the lunar environment. NASA has plans to purchase services for delivery of payloads to the Moon through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contract. Under this subtopic, proposals may include efforts to develop payloads for flight demonstration of relevant technologies in the lunar environment. The CLPS payload accommodations will vary depending on the particular service provider and mission characteristics. Additional information on the CLPS program and providers can be found at this link: https://www.nasa.gov/content/commercial-lunar-payload-services. CLPS missions will typically carry multiple payloads for multiple customers. Smaller, simpler, and more self-sufficient payloads are more easily accommodated and would be more likely to be considered for a NASA-sponsored flight opportunity. Commercial payload delivery services may begin as early as 2020 and flight opportunities are expected to continue well into the future. In future years it is expected that larger and more complex payloads will be accommodated. Selection for award under this solicitation will not guarantee selection for a lunar flight opportunity.
",3 to 5,"Prototype, Analysis, Hardware, Software
","Example deliverables coming from a successful phase II within this subtopic, might including some of the following:
Designs of cryo-capable or dust tolerant mechanisms motor controllers with test data and prototypes Prototype rovers or scale versions of prototype rovers showing novel mobility architecture for escaping entrapment in regolith Software algorithms including demonstrating slip detection or image processing in harsh lunar lighting conditions Software packages either standalone or integrated with commercially available or open-source robotic simulation packages (preferred).
NASA is also interested in technologies demonstrations that could serve as payloads on commercial landers at the end of phase II.
","Current state of the art in robotic surface mobility is the MER/MSL (Mars Exploration Rover/Mars Science Laboratory) rovers for Mars and the Chinese Chang'e on the moon. Since the end of the NASA Constellation program in 2011, there has been only small pockets of technology development for the lunar surface within NASA and other space agencies, plus the small business/academic communities.
The specific areas noted above for targeted development (mechanisms, cryoactuators, magnetic gearing, perception systems, terramechanics simulations and novel mobility architectures) are all of specific interest as they are specific challenges unique to the lunar surface and lunar poles specifically.
Magnetic gearing has become practical in recent years due to the availability of high energy density magnets and design topologies that conserve volume. As a result, there has been an exponential growth in R&D for Earth applications like wind/wave energy generators and hybrid vehicle power-trains.
","This SBIR resides within STMD as a vehicle for development of technology objectives. It is expected that successful projects would infuse technology into either the STMD Game Changing Development (GCD) or Technology Demonstration Missions (TDM) programs. Technology could also be infused into joint efforts involving STMD's partners (other mission directorates, other government agencies, and the commercial sector). Flights for these technology missions could be supported on small commercial lunar landers (SMD) or possibly mid-size NASA lunar landers (HEOMD).

","NASA is still formulating its approach to future lunar science and exploration. The current plan is to start with small commercial landers (<100kg) beginning as early as 2019, with relatively high launch cadence (2+ launches/year). In the future, NASA seeks to build mid-to-large landers, with an eye on human-rated landers with a first mid-sized lander planned for 2022.

","The State Of the Art (SOA) for Free-Space Optical Communications (FSOC) can be subdivided into near-earth (extending to cis- and trans-lunar distances) and planetary ranges with the Lagrange points falling in between.
Near Earth FSOC technology has completed a number of technology demonstrations from space and is more mature. Nonetheless, low size-weight power novel high speed 10-100 Gb/s space-qualified laser transmitters and receivers are sought. These transmitters and receivers can possibly be infused for deep space proximity links, such as landed assets on planetary surfaces to orbiting assets with distances of 5000-100000 km or inter-satellite links. Innovative light-weight space-qualified modems for handling multiple optical modulation schemes.
A technology demonstration for deep space FSOC is anticipated in the next decade. Critical gaps following a successful technology demonstration will be light-weighted 30-50 cm optical with a wide operational temperature range -20C to 50C over which wave front error and focus is stable. High peak-to-average power space qualified lasers with average powers of 20-50 W.

","A number of FSOC-related NASA projects are ongoing with launch expected in the 2019-2022 time frame. The Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD) is an earth-to-geostationary satellite relay demonstration to launch in late 2019. The Illuma -T Project will extend the relay demonstration to include a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) node on the ISS in 2021. In 2022 the EM-2 Optical to Orion (O2O) demonstration will transmit data from the Orion crewed capsule as it travels to the Moon and back. In 2022 the DSOC Project technology demonstration will be hosted by the Psyche Mission spacecraft extending FSOC links to astronomical unit distances.

This drives the need for increased precision in absolute and relative navigation solutions and more advanced algorithms for both ground and onboard navigation, guidance and control. This sub-topic seeks advancements in flight dynamics and navigation technology for applications in Earth orbit, lunar, and deep space that enables future NASA missions. In particular, technology relating to autonomous onboard navigation, guidance, and control, and trajectory optimization are solicited. See Reference 1 below for NASA Technical Area (TA) roadmaps:

","Algorithms and software for rapid and robust preliminary and high-fidelity design and optimization of low thrust trajectories in a multi-body dynamical environment (such as cislunar space) currently do not exist. Designing trajectories for these types of missions relies heavily on hands-on work by very experienced people. That works reasonably well for designing a single reference trajectory but not as well for exploring trade spaces or when designing thousands of trajectories for a Monte-Carlo or missed-thrust robustness analysis.

Trajectory design for these complex missions can take weeks or months to generate a single reference trajectory. Providing algorithms and software to speed up this process will enable missions to more fully explore trade spaces and more quickly respond to changes in the mission.

","Future NASA missions require precision landing, rendezvous, formation flying, proximity operations (e.g., servicing and assembly), non-cooperative object capture and coordinated platform operations in Earth orbit, cislunar space, libration orbits and deep space. These missions require a high degree of autonomy.

See Reference 1 for NASA Technical Area (TA) roadmaps:

Focus Area 5 Communications and Navigation,H9.03Flight Dynamics and Navigation Technology,"Conjunction Assessment Risk Analysis (CARA)
","The U.S. Space Surveillance Network currently tracks more than 22,000 objects larger than 10 centimeters and the number of objects in orbit is steadily increasing which causes an increasing threat to human spaceflight and robotic missions in the near-Earth environment. The NASA Conjunction Assessment Risk Analysis (CARA) team receives screening data from the 18th Space Control Squadron concerning predicted close approaches between NASA satellites and other space objects. CARA determines the risk posed by those events and recommends risk mitigation strategies, including collision avoidance maneuvers, to protect NASA non-human-spaceflight assets in Earth orbit. The ability to perform CARA more accurately and rapidly will improve space safety for all near-Earth operations. This subtopic seeks innovative technologies to improve the CARA process including (see Reference 1 for NASA Technical Area (TA) roadmaps):
Event evolution prediction methods, models and algorithms with improved ability to predict characteristics for single and ensemble risk assessment, especially using artificial intelligence/machine learning (TA 5.5.3). Methods for combining commercial data (observations or ephemerides) with 18 SPCS –derived solutions (available as Vector Covariance Messages, Conjunction Data Messages, or Astrodynamics Support Workstation output) to create a single improved orbit determination solution including more data sources.

","Phase 1 research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility, with preliminary software being delivered for NASA testing, as well as show a plan toward Phase 2 integration. Phase 2 new technology development efforts shall deliver components at the TRL 5-6 level with mature algorithms and software components complete and preliminary integration and testing in a quasi-operational environment.
","Current state of the art has been adequate in performing conjunction assessment and collision mitigation for space objects that fall under the high interest events (HIE). With the incorporation of the Space Fence, the number of objects tracked and assessed for conjunctions will increase by one or more orders of magnitude, this presents a critical gap in which current approaches may not suffice. Thus, smarter ways to perform conjunction analysis and assessments such as methods for bundling events and performing ensemble risk assessment, Middle-duration risk assessment (longer duration than possible for discrete events but shorter than decades-long analyses that use gas dynamics assumptions), Improved Conjunction Assessment (CA) event evolution prediction, Machine learning / Artificial Intelligence (AI) applied to CA risk assessment parameters and/or event evolution are needed. The decision space for collision avoidance relies on not only the quality of the data (state and covariance) but also the tools and techniques for conjunction assessment.
Collision avoidance maneuver decisions are based on predicted close approach distance and probability of collision. The accuracy of these numbers depend on underlying measurements and mathematics used in estimation. Current methods assume Gaussian distributions for errors and that all objects are shaped like cannon balls for non-gravitational force computations. These assumptions and others cause inaccurate estimates which can lead decision makers to perform unnecessary collision avoidance maneuvers, thus wasting propellant. Better techniques are needed for orbit prediction and covariance characterization and propagation. Better modeling of non-gravitational force effects is needed to improve orbit prediction. Modeling of non-gravitational forces relies on knowledge of individual object characteristics.
","This technology is relevant and needed for all human spaceflight and robotic missions in the near-Earth environment. The ability to perform CARA more accurately will improve space safety for all near-Earth operations, improve operational support by providing more accurate and longer term predictions and reduce propellant usage for collision avoidance maneuvers.

Focus Area 5 Communications and Navigation,H9.07Cognitive Communication,"Lunar Cognitive Capabilities
","NASA's Space Communication and Navigation (SCaN) program seeks innovative approaches to increase mission science data return, improve resource efficiencies for NASA missions and communication networks and ensure resilience in the unpredictable space environment. The Cognitive Communication subtopic specifically focuses on advances in space communication driven by on-board data processing and modern space networking capabilities. A cognitive system is envisioned to sense, detect, adapt, and learn from its experiences and environment to optimize the communications capabilities for the user mission satellite or network infrastructure. The underlying need for these technologies is to reduce both the mission and network operations burden.
Examples of these cognitive capabilities include:
Link technologies - reconfiguration and autonomy, maximizing use of bandwidth while avoiding interference Network technologies - robust inter-satellite links, data storage/forwarding, multi-node routing in unpredictable environments System technologies - optimal scheduling techniques for satellite and surface relays in distributed and real-time environments
Through Space Policy Directive-1, NASA is committed to landing American astronauts on the Moon by 2024. In support of this goal, cognitive communication techniques are needed for lunar communication satellite and surface relays. Cognitive agents operating on lunar elements will manage communication, provide diagnostics, automate resource scheduling, and dynamically update data flow in response to the types of data flowing over the lunar network. Goals of this capability are to improve communications efficiency, mitigate channel impairments, and reduce operations complexity and cost through intelligent and autonomous communications and data handling.
Examples of research and/or technology development include:
On-board processing technology and techniques to enable data switching, routing, storage, and processing on a relay spacecraft Data-centric, decentralized network data routing and scheduling techniques that are responsive to quality of service metrics Simultaneous wideband sensing and communications for S-, X-, and Ka-bands, coupled with algorithms that learn from the environment Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms applied to optimize space communication links, networks, or systems Flexible communication platforms with novel signal processing technology to support cognitive approaches Other innovative, related areas of interest to the field of cognitive communications
Proposals to this subtopic should consider application to a lunar communications architecture consisting of surface assets (e.g., astronauts, science stations, surface relays), lunar communication relay satellites, Gateway, and ground stations on Earth. The lunar communication relay satellites require technology with low size, weight, and power attributes suitable for small satellite (e.g., 50kg) or cubesat operations. Proposed solutions should highlight advancements to provide the needed communications capability while minimizing use of on-board resources such as power and propellant. Proposals should consider how the technology can mature into a successful demonstration in the lunar architecture.
",4 to 6,"Prototype, Hardware, Software
","Phase I will study technical feasibility, infusion potential for lunar operations, clear/achievable benefits and show a path towards a Phase II implementation. Phase I deliverables can include a feasibility assessment and concept of operations of the research topic, simulations and/or measurements, validation of the proposed approach to develop a given product (TRL 3-4) and a plan for further development of the specific capabilities or products to be performed in Phase II. Early development, integration, test, and delivery prototype hardware/software is encouraged but not necessary.
Phase II will emphasize hardware/software development with delivery of specific hardware or software product for NASA targeting demonstration operations on a small satellite or cubesat platform. Phase II deliverables include a working prototype (engineering model) of the proposed product/platform or software, along with documentation of development, capabilities, and measurements, and related documents and tools as necessary for NASA to modify and use the cognitive software capability or hardware component(s). Hardware prototypes shall show a path towards flight demonstration, such as a flight qualification approach and preliminary estimates of thermal, vibration, and radiation capabilities of the flight hardware. Software prototypes shall be implemented on platforms that have a clear path to a flight qualifiable platform. Opportunities and plans should be identified for technology commercialization. Software applications and platform/infrastructure deliverables for software defined radio platforms shall be compliant with the latest NASA standard for software defined radios, the Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS), NASA-STD-4009 and NASA-HNBK-4009.
","To summarize NASA Technology Roadmap TA5: ""As human and science exploration missions move further from Earth and become increasingly more complex, they present unique challenges to onboard communications systems and networks...Intelligent radio systems will help manage the increased complexity and provide greater capability to the mission to return more science data...Reconfigurable radio systems...could autonomously optimize the RF links, network protocols, and modes used based on the needs of the various mission phases. A cognitive radio system would sense its RF environment and adapt and learn from its various configuration changes to optimize the communications links throughout the system in order to maximize science data transfer, enable substantial efficiencies, and reduce latency. The challenges in this area are in the efficient integration of different capabilities and components, unexpected radio or system decisions or behavior, and methods to verify decision-making algorithms as compared to known, planned performance.""
The technology need for the lunar communication architecture includes:
Data routing from surface assets to a lunar communication relay satellite, where data is unscheduled, a-periodic, and ad-hoc Data routing between lunar relay satellites as necessary to conserve power, route data to Earth, and meet quality of service requirements Efficient use of lunar communication spectrum while co-existing with future/current interference sources On-demand communication resource scheduling Multi-hop, delay tolerant routing
Critical gaps between the state of the art and the technology need include:
Implementation of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques on SWaP-constrained platforms Integrated wide-band sensing and narrow-band communication on the same radio terminal Inter-satellite networking and routing, especially in unpredictable and unscheduled environments On-demand scheduling technology for communication links Cross-layer optimization approaches for optimum communication efficiency at a system level
","Cognitive technologies are critical for the lunar communications architecture. The majority of lunar operations will be run remotely from Earth, which could require substantial coordination and planning as NASA, foreign space agencies, and commercial interests all place assets on the Moon. As lunar communications and networks become more complex, cognition and automation are essential to mitigate complexity and reduce operations costs. Machine learning will configure networks, choose radio configurations, adjust for impairments and failures, and monitor short and long term performance for improvements.

","NASA seeks innovative, groundbreaking, and high impact developments in spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control technologies in support of future science and exploration mission requirements. This subtopic covers mission enabling technologies that have significant Size, Weight and Power, Cost, and Performance (SWaP-CP) improvements over the state-of-the-art Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) capabilities in the areas of Spacecraft Attitude Determination and Control Systems, Absolute and Relative Navigation Systems, and Pointing Control Systems, and Radiation-Hardened Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) Hardware.

Radiation-Hardened Hardware: GNC sensors that could operate in a high radiation environment, such as the Jovian environment. Fast-light or Exceptional-Point Enhanced Gyroscopes and Accelerometers: In conventional ring laser gyros, precision increases with cavity size and measurement time. However, by using Fast-Light (FL) media or Exceptional Points (EPs) in coupled resonators, an increase in gyro sensitivity can be achieved without having to increase size or measurement time, thereby increasing the time for standalone spacecraft navigation. (The increased precision also opens up new science possibilities such as measurements of fundamental physical constants, improving the sensitivity-bandwidth product for gravity wave detection, and tests of general relativity.) Prototype FL- or EP-enhanced gyros are sought that can be implemented in a compact rugged design that is tolerant to variations in temperature and G-conditions, with the ultimate goal of demonstrating decreased angular random walk.

Focus Area 5 Communications and Navigation,T5.03Electric Field Mapping and Prediction Methods within Spacecraft Enclosures,"Expected Electric Field Prediction Methods in Fairing/Aircraft and Spacecraft Enclosures
","NASA Launch Services program is responsible for ensuring the safety of NASA payloads on commercial rockets. NASA has also undertaken Gateway. This includes prediction and mitigation of hazardous electric fields created within the payload enclosure and similar areas of the rocket. NASA and industry have commonly used approximation methods to determine the average fields in enclosures. In the last decade the Launch Services Program (LSP) has funded studies to support quantification of electromagnetic field characterization in fairing cavities due to internal and external sources. By accurately predicting these fields, acoustic and thermal blanketing can be optimized for Radio Frequency (RF) attenuation and design changes can be quickly evaluated reducing schedule impacts. Cost savings can also be realized by reducing stringent radiated susceptibility requirements, and reliability improved by accurately predicting signal transmission/reception environments within enclosures. This methodology can also improve human exposure safety limits evaluations for manned vehicle enclosures with transmitting systems.
Initially, studies focused on computational methods using the recent advances in computing power and the improved efficiency of matrix based solutions provided by Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computing. Results indicate solution of an integrated fairing is deterministic, but sensitive to small variation in structures, materials. As of yet, only the empty or sparse cavity can be reliably solved with 3D computational tools, even with large computing systems and the use of non-linear basis functions. Results also indicate that computational approximation methods such as physical optics and multilevel fast multipole are not reliable prediction methods within enclosures of this scale because of the underlying assumption sets that are inconsistent with enclosure boundaries. More recently, LSP has concentrated on statistically formulating a compilation of test/computational results to produce a maximum expected environment. Preliminary results are promising in the area of statistical bounding of the desired solution. The researched methodology should offer the following advantages over 3D computational and standard volume based approximation methods:
Predict both statistical mean and maximum expected E field and/or common mode current. Consider the over-moded (electrically large conductive cavities) and under-moded (electrically smaller damped enclosures). Consider complex materials with multiple joined enclosures. Applications of this prediction methodology are far reaching and include shielding effectiveness and prediction of fields within a cavity enclosure due to internal transmitters and operating avionics.
To enable bounded solutions in electromagnetic environment prediction, proposals are solicited to develop technology that does the following:
Bounds the expected peak electric field environment inside enclosures such as rocket fairings, and spacecraft enclosures. The method should include the technology required, the technique, as well as the necessary verification efforts. Develops a numerical or statistically based methodology for characterizing shielding effectiveness of enclosures with associated applicable apertures. Develops methods field enhancement/reduction based on thermal/acoustic blanketing and metal/composite components such as avionics and Payload Attached Fitting (PAF) structures. Develops preliminary user friendly modeling software that can be easily customized to support NASA-specific applications.
",3 to 6,"Prototype, Analysis, Software, Research
","Phase I Deliverables: Research, identify and evaluate candidate algorithms or concepts for electromagnetic field mapping of typical spacecraft and rocket enclosures. Demonstrate the technical feasibility, and show a path towards a computer model development. It should identify improvements over the current state of the art for both time/resource savings and systems development and the feasibility of the approach in a varied-enclosure environment. Lab-level demonstrations are required. Deliverables must include a report documenting findings.
Phase II Deliverables: Emphasis should be placed on developing usable computer model and demonstrating the technology with under and over-moded conditions with testing. Deliverables shall include a report outlining the path showing how the technology could be matured and applied to mission-worthy systems, verification test results, computer model with user’s and other associated documentation. Deliverable of a functional computer model with associated software is expected at the completion of the Phase II contract.
","Reliability of communications systems is critical for all spacecraft. Determining RF exposure limits in cavity environments is also critical. Given this criticality it is often desired to transmit and receive before separation from the launch vehicle where there is precise tracking information to improve the probability of signal capture. When the transmission or reception is in the launch vehicle fairing whether for pre-flight checks or during launch, the presence of the cavity surrounding the antennas causes significant uncertainties in the desired signal. In addition, there is a significant increase in the RF environment in which the spacecraft and launch vehicle hardware are exposed. Since hardware qualification testing is based on free space environments the higher fields in the cavity can lead to an increase mission risk of failure due to susceptible hardware. Prediction of fields within rectangular highly conductive over-moded chambers is well studied in the reverberation testing community; however, launch vehicle fairings are sometimes composite and always covered with acoustic damping materials that have unknown RF damping characteristics. There are also thermal materials surrounding launch vehicle and spacecraft avionics and instruments leading to further complications in defining the communication path losses and RF environment exposure and cavity mode underdamping characteristics where more research is needed especially in the layered wall covering case.
Determining the RF environment in the fairing cavity is a significant problem that affects every launched mission; even if transmission with the fairing is not planned, it has historically happened inadvertently and the effects of failed inhibits are required to be provided. Shielding effectiveness to external range and launch vehicle transmitters are also significantly affected by not only the material conductive properties, but also the characteristics of the penetrated cavity.
3D computational electromagnetic tools are limited by the size of the matrix required to solve the typical transmit frequency of at least 2GHz in a cavity with 5 meter diameters and over 10 meter length. The size of just modeling the fairing alone is daunting using method of moments (limited also by non-uniqueness for external radiators) and unachievable with finite difference frequency domain. When internal spacecraft and blanketing structures are added, the computational limits are quickly surpassed. Approximation techniques such as physical optics and multilevel fast multipole methods are limited by underlying assumptions that do not hold in cavity environments. Time domain techniques are not clearly fitted for frequency specific applications and have shown similar size/complexity limitations.
Substantially, new methods are needed to predict path loss, shielding effectiveness and RF environment in launch vehicle fairings and spacecraft cavities.

Focus Area 5 Communications and Navigation,T5.04Quantum Communications,,"NASA seeks to develop quantum networks to support the transmission of quantum information for aerospace applications. This distribution of quantum information could potentially be utilized in secure communication, sensor arrays and quantum computer networks. Quantum communication may provide new ways to improve communication link security and availability through techniques such as quantum cryptographic key distribution. Another area of benefit is the entanglement of distributed sensor networks to provide extreme sensitivity for applications such as astrophysics, planetary science and earth science. Also of interest are ideas or concepts to support the communication of quantum information between quantum computers over significant free space distances (greater than 10km up to GEO) for space applications. Technologies that are needed include quantum memory, quantum entanglement sources, quantum repeaters, high efficiency detectors, quantum processors, quantum sensors that make use of quantum communication for distributed arrays and integrated systems that bring several of these aspects together using Integrated Quantum Photonics. A key need for all of these are technologies with low size, weight and power that can be utilized in aerospace applications. Some examples of requested innovation include:
High brightness, efficient and tunable sources of entangled photon pairs. Photonic waveguide interferometric circuits for quantum information processing and manipulation of entangled quantum states; requires phase stability, low propagation loss, i.e. < 0.1 dB/cm, and efficient fiber coupling, i.e. coupling loss < 1.5 dB Waveguide-integrated single photon detectors for > 100 MHz incidence rate, 1-sigma time resolution of < 25 ps, dark count rate < 100 Hz, and single-photon detection efficiency > 50% at highest incidence rate Integrated sensors that support arrays of distributed sensors, such as an entangled interferometric imaging array Integrated photonic circuit quantum memory Integrated photonic circuits and detectors for balanced homodyne detection Quantum entanglement verifying system
Quantum sensor focused proposals that do not include an aspect of quantum communication should propose to the Quantum Sensing and Measurement subtopic as individual quantum sensors are not covered by this subtopic.

","Phase I research should (highly encouraged) be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility with preliminary hardware (i.e. beyond architecture approach/theory; a proof-of-concept) being delivered for NASA testing, as well as show a plan toward Phase II integration. Phase II new technology development efforts shall deliver components at the TRL 4-6 level with mature hardware and preliminary integration and testing in an operational environment. Deliverables are desired that substantiate the quantum communication technology utility for positively impacting the NASA mission. The quantum communication technology should impact one of three key areas: information security, sensor networks, and networks of quantum computers. Deliverables that substantiate technology efficacy include reports of key experimental demonstrations that show significant capabilities, but in general it is desired that the deliverable include some hardware that shows the demonstrated capability.
","There is a critical gap between the United States and other countries, such as Japan, Singapore, Austria and China in quantum communications in space. Quantum communications is called for in the 2018 National Quantum Initiative (NQI) Act, which directs National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), National Science Foundation (NSF) and Department of Energy (DOE) to pursue research, development and education activities related to Quantum Information Science. Applications in quantum communication, networking and sensing, all proposed in this subtopic, are the contributions being pursued by NASA to integrate the advancements being made through the NQI.
","This technology would benefit NASA communications infrastructure as well as enable new capabilities that support its core missions. For instance, advances in quantum communication would provide capabilities for added information security for spacecraft assets as well as provide a capability for linking quantum computers on the ground and in orbit. In terms of quantum sensing arrays, there are a number of sensing applications that could be supported through the use of quantum sensing arrays for dramatically improved sensitivity.

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,H3.01Advancements in Carbon Dioxide Reduction: Critical Subsystems and Solid Carbon Repurposing,"Carbon Dioxide Reduction System Components and Unit Processes
","NASA has invested in many carbon dioxide reduction technologies over the years to increase the percentage of oxygen recovery from carbon dioxide in human spacecraft for long duration missions. Examples of technologies include, but are not limited to, Series-Bosch, Continuous Bosch, Methane Pyrolysis and Microfluidic Carbon Dioxide Electrolysis. Significant technical challenges still face these process technologies and are impeding progress in technology maturation. Critical technical elements of these technologies have a high degree of technical difficulty. Examples where additional technology development is needed include (this is a partial list):
High temperature gas purification and/or separation for CO, H2, and hydrocarbon rich streams. Nuisance particulate carbon contamination. Solid carbon clogging of frits and filters in recycle gas streams. Safe collection, removal and disposal of solid carbon while reactors are in operation. Subsystems to recharge reactors with new catalyst and to efficiently use or recycle consumable catalysts.
This subtopic is open to consider novel ideas that address any of the numerous technical challenges that face development of carbon dioxide reduction hardware with particular attention to those listed above. Specifics on two of these challenges are provided below.
Gas Purification and/or Separation for Carbon Monoxide, Hydrogen and Hydrocarbon Rich Streams
Many process technologies currently under development have challenging multi-component streams which could benefit from improved gas separation technology. High purity, high yield and continuous supply of separated gases are all desirable features of a proposed technology. The targeted process streams that may benefit from improved gas separations are the following:
Producing a high-purity hydrogen product from a hydrogen-rich gas stream containing acetylene (as high as 6.4 mole %), trace amounts of other hydrocarbons (ethylene, ethane, benzene), unreacted methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and water vapor. It is imperative that the proposed separation technologies do not hydrogenate hydrocarbons, such as acetylene. This separation is directed at methane pyrolysis technologies including the Plasma Pyrolysis Assembly (PPA). Hydrogen separation from an ethylene-rich stream. This separation is directed at the effluent stream from a Microfluidic Electrochemical Reactor which consists of ethylene, hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and water vapor. Recovery of unreacted carbon dioxide and hydrogen from a carbon monoxide-rich stream. This separation is needed for a Bosch/Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) Reactor.
Technology solutions could include, but not be limited to, filtration, mechanical separation or novel sorbents. If novel sorbents are developed the proposed technology solution should also address issues with scale-up to kg quantities (difficult for some novel sorbents). Technology solutions proposed in this subtopic could potentially be leveraged for In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) applications.
Separation of Particulate Carbon and Hydrocarbons from Process Gas Streams
Oxygen recovery technology options, including carbon formation reactors and methane pyrolysis reactors almost universally result in particulates in the form of solid carbon or solid hydrocarbons. Mitigation for these particulates will be essential to the success and maintainability of these systems during long duration missions. Techniques and methods leading to compact, regenerable devices for removing, managing and disposing of residual particulate matter within ECLSS process equipment are sought. Separation performance approaching HEPA rating is desired for ultrafine particulate matter with minimal pressure drop. The separator should be capable of operating for hours at high particle loading rates and then employ techniques and methods to restore its capacity back to nearly 100% of its original clean state through in-place and autonomous regeneration or self-cleaning operations using minimal or no consumables (including media-free hydrodynamic separators). The device must minimize crew exposure to accumulated particulate matter and enable easy particulate matter disposal or chemical repurposing.
",,,,"Future long duration human exploration missions may benefit from further closure of the Atmosphere Revitalization System (ARS). The state-of-the-art Sabatier system, which has flown on the International Space Station as the Carbon Dioxide Reduction Assembly (CRA), only recovers about half of the oxygen from metabolic carbon dioxide. This is because there is insufficient hydrogen to react all available carbon dioxide. The Sabatier reacts hydrogen with carbon dioxide to produce methane and water. The methane is vented overboard as a waste product causing a net loss of hydrogen. Mars missions target >75% oxygen recovery from carbon dioxide, with a goal to approach 100% recovery. NASA is developing several alternate technologies that have the potential to increase the percentage of oxygen recovery from carbon dioxide, toward fully closing the ARS loop. Methane pyrolysis recovers hydrogen from methane, making additional hydrogen available to react with carbon dioxide. Other technologies under investigation process carbon dioxide, recovering a higher percentage of oxygen than the Sabatier. All of these alternative systems, however, need additional technology investment to reach a level of maturity necessary for consideration for use in a flight environmental control and life support system (ECLSS).

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,H3.01Advancements in Carbon Dioxide Reduction: Critical Subsystems and Solid Carbon Repurposing,"Solid Carbon Repurposing
","Solid carbon is produced as a major by-product from many candidate oxygen recovery technologies under consideration for long-duration missions, including Bosch, Series Bosch, Methane Pyrolysis by Carbon Vapor Deposition, and technologies containing carbon formation reactors. Based on metabolic CO2 production for a crew of 4, 1.135 kg of solid carbon, with a volume as high as 2.8 liters, may be produced each day by oxygen recovery technologies, which then must be disposed of or repurposed. Repurposing of this carbon reduces logistical challenges associated with its disposal and may ultimately result in materials or processes advantageous for long-duration missions. The produced solid carbon may include nanofibers, microfibers and amorphous material with varying particle size, with the smallest in the micrometer range (10-50 µm). It may contain quantities of metals including, but not limited to, iron, nickel and cobalt. The solid carbon may be in the form of a loose powder or a densified cake with densities ranging from 0.4 to 1.8 g/cc and will vary by technology. Venting or disposal of this carbon to space will present considerable logistical challenges and will result in large volumes of space debris. Disposal of this carbon on a planetary surface may result in concerns for planetary protection or planetary science. NASA is seeking technologies and/or processes that repurpose solid carbon and its contaminants resulting in useful products for transit, deep space or planetary surface missions. The technology and/or process must limit crew exposure to the raw carbon.
",,,,"No existing operational technology exists in this focused technical area. A crew of 6 during a 540 day Mars surface mission could potentially generate 920 kg of solid carbon - this will be a significant storage or disposal issue and may be a considerable raw product resource for potential utilization. Very limited research and development have been performed in this area. Some studies added carbon to plastic trash which subsequently was processed by a heat melt compactor to make ""tiles"", which encapsulated the carbon. Although these tiles are a safe way to get rid of trash waste, they were also studied for potential benefit for use as spacecraft radiation shielding. Other work included adding binders to make rudimentary bricks for structural use.
","These technologies would be essential and enabling to long duration human exploration missions, in cases where closure of the atmosphere revitalization loop will trade over alternate ECLSS architectures. The atmosphere revitalization loop on the ISS is only about 50% closed when the Sabatier is operational. These technologies may be applicable to Gateway, Lunar surface, and Mars, including surface and transit. This technology could be proven on the ISS.
This subtopic is directed at needs identified by the Life Support Systems Capability Leadership Team (CLT) in areas of water recovery and environmental monitoring, functional areas of Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS).
The Life Support Systems (LSS) Project, under the Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) Program, within the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD), is the expected customer. The LSS Project would be in position to sponsor Phase III and technology infusion.

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,H3.02Microbial Monitoring for Spacecraft Cabins,"Spacecraft Microbial Monitoring for Long Duration Human Missions
","With the advent of molecular methods, emphasis is now being placed on nucleic acids to rapidly detect microorganisms. However, the sensitivity of current gene-based microbial detection systems is low (~100 gene copies per reaction), requires elaborate sample processing steps, involves destructive analyses, and requires fluids to be transferred and detection systems are relatively large size. Recent advancements in the metabolomics field have potential to substitute (or augment) current gene-based microbial detection technologies that are multi-stepped, destructive and labor intensive (e.g. significant crew time). NASA is soliciting non-gene based microbial detection technologies and systems that target microbial metabolites and that quantify the microbial burden of surfaces, air and water inside future long-duration deep space habitats.
Potable Water: A simple integrated, microbial sensor system that enables sample collection, processing and detection of microbes or microbial activity in the crew potable water supply is sought. A system that is fully-automated and can be in-line in an Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS)-like water system is preferred.
Habitat Surfaces: Future crewed habitats in cis-lunar space will be crew-tended and thus unoccupied for many months at a time. When crew reoccupies the habitat they will want to quickly, efficiently, and accurately assess the microbial status of the habitat surfaces. A microbial assessment / monitoring system or hand-held device that requires little to no consumables is sought.
Airborne Contamination: Future human spacecraft, such as Gateway and Mars vehicles, may be required to be dormant while crew is absent from the vehicle, for periods that could last from 1 to 3 years. Before crews can return, these environments must be verified prior to crew return. These novel methods have the potential to enable remote autonomous microbial monitoring that does not require manual sample collection, preparation or processing.

","The State of the Art (SOA) on ISS for microbial monitoring is culturing and counting, as well as grab samples which are returned to earth. NASA has invested DNA-based (PCR) systems, partially robotic in some cases, to eliminate the need for on-orbit culturing. However, a fully automated system is still not ready and there is still a gap for a low- or no-crew time detection system.

","Sterile compliant bladder, capable of storing ultrapure feedwater with a relatively high cycle life:In order for the thermal control loop to operate properly, a water source is needed. An effective, efficient, sterile and durable feedwater bladder is essential. The suit pressure acts on this bladder and as water evaporates, the bladder resupplies the loop. The bladder must be clean and not leak particulates or polymer chains over long periods of quiescence. The water in the control loop contains a biocide and the bladder must not react with these chemicals to form potential contaminants. The maximum design pressure (MDP) for the system at a lunar environment will be 16 psid with a cycle life of 4 X 156 = 624 MDP. Having a bladder with these qualities not only buys down the safety risk of rupture, it promotes reliability at higher pressures and provides an avenue to extend Extravehicular Activity (EVA) length.

","Trace contaminant removal capability: Non-regenerable activated carbon is the current state of the art for trace contamination control. However, this provides a logistics impact to future missions. The primary trace contaminants that must be removed include ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (CH2O), and methanethiol (also known as methyl mercaptan) (CH3SH). The minimum objective would be to remove all of the significant compounds that threaten to exceed the 7-day Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentrations (SMAC) values during an EVA. The ideal solution would be a vacuum-regenerable sorbent that could be integrated with the Exploration Portable Life Support System (xPLSS) CO2/H2O removal system. This system performs regeneration or desorption by exposing the sorbent to a pressure swing from 4.3 psia to <1 torr over approximately 2 minutes. Temperatures remain in the 60-80oF range with a small amount of heat flux from the cross-coupled adsorbing bed. Additional heat input requirements from resistance heaters or other sources would negatively impact the system trade the more significant the value becomes.

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,H4.05Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment Connector Upgrade and Glove Humidity Reduction,"Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment (LCVG) water loop connector upgrade and glove humidity reduction
","LCVG water connector upgrade:The connector of the liquid cooling and ventilation garment (LCVG) for the space suit has been a source of failures in the current extra-vehicular mobility unit (EMU). Increased reliability and durability are needed for future space suits that will be used during long-duration missions, which include periods (up to 6 months) of quiescence. Two primary design problems can be addressed:
1) Cold flow of the ethyl-vinyl acetate tubing at the connection to the LCVG connector, which causes leaks to form
2) Sticking of the poppet seal, which allows the LCVG connector to leak. The poppet seal sticks after the seal lubricant is washed away.
A requirement that increases the challenge in designing a non-sticking poppet seal is, because the poppet seal is in the water loop of the space suit, the seal material used must maintain the high water quality requirements for the space suit water loop. Water leakage from the LCVG thermal loop connectors shall be less than 0.5 cc/hr when running at nominal operating pressure of 15 psid.
The connector should not generally leach material into the water flowing through it. Therefore, the connector needs to maintain water quality to the following levels in order to avoid affecting the performance of other equipment within the space suit water loop. In addition, galvanic corrosion in the water loop is of concern. Therefore the connector wetted surfaces, and in general the body should be constructed out of Titanium 6Al-4V wherever possible and stainless steel when necessary. Aluminum alloys should be avoided. Other wetted materials, such as seals or gaskets would preferably be constructed out of currently-used materials such as silicones.
The connector would also need to be compatible with the water solution of Iodine at concentrations of 0.5 – 5 ppm.
Additionally, the connector would need to be compatible with inlet water containing contaminants such as those listed below:

","The phase 1 needs to deliver a detailed design solution with information that provides confidence that hardware fabricated in the Phase II will resolve the current design challenges.
","The 30+ history of the EMU has demonstrated these two design weaknesses as a potential for space suit failures for the exploration space suit. Without new design solutions, the exploration space suit will be limited by these weaknesses. In preparation for the exploration space suit, solving these problems are critical.
","This subtopic is relevant across the Moon to Mars portfolio. Any mission in which an extra-vehicular activity suit is utilized will benefit from the increased reliability of a suit in which the current connector flaws are rectified.

Glove humidity reduction: Onycholysis due to humidity and water in space suit gloves during Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) training and during extra-vehicular activity is a common observation. Ventilation in gloves is poor allowing moisture to accumulate, which contributes to onycholysis and results in nail bed damage, skin damage, and fungal infections. NASA seeks solutions to reducing moisture in space suit gloves. LCVG ventilation improvements that could ventilate the glove are difficult due to ducting required that would cross the elbow. This ducting is undesirable since it impedes mobility of the elbow joint. Alternative solutions are desired that will prevent onycholysis during suited operations.
The LCVG ventilation ducting consists of a ducting network with one duct running down each arm and each leg. See “Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment” description and images at “https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/spacesuits/home/clickable_suit_nf.html. The ventilation ducts end just above the elbows for the arms and at the feet for the legs. The ventilation gas enters the spacesuit at helmet and flows over the body because the ends of the ducts at the elbows and feet are open. The fan in the portable life support subsystem (PLSS) pulls the ventilation from these open ends and sends the gas to be processed before recycling it back to the helmet. Since the ventilation duct in the arms end at the elbows, the wrist and hand areas are not well ventilated.

Building from the success of the international partnerships for International Space Station (ISS), space agencies from multiple governments are looking for roles on the Gateway. A particular focus has been made to include the rapidly growing commercial space industry to provide an important role in supporting a sustained presence on the Moon. All of these potential partners will have their own design capabilities, their own development processes and internal constituencies to support. Integrating and enabling disparate systems built in different locations by different owners to all work cohesively together will require a significant upgrade to the core systems engineering capabilities.
In the last decade Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) technology has matured as evidenced by the development of Systems Modeling Language (SysML) tools and frameworks that support engineers in development efforts from requirements through hardware and software implementation. MBSE holds considerable promise for accelerating, reducing overhead labor, and improving the quality of systems development. However, a remaining bottleneck is the coordination and integration of system development across distributed organizations, such as the multiple partners developing lunar gateway and eventual Mars exploration. This subtopic seeks technology to fill this gap.
Areas of particular need include:
Methodologies that support integration among tools and exchange of information between multidisciplinary artifacts using automated intelligent reasoning. The definition of open interface standards and tools to enable inspection of distributed models across engineering domains. Tools or systems that allow models to be shared across development environments and trace the resulting system model back to contributions from multiple partners. Modeling environments that facilitate user interaction from multiple stakeholders of varying expertise in MBSE. Continuous integration and verification of safety critical system requirements that depend on disparate development sources.
",4 to 6,"Prototype, Software
","Methodologies and tools that support distributed development efforts
","For distributed development, the state-of-the-art tends to be laboriously negotiated interface control documents and manual integration processes that are inherently slow and labor intensive. In an effort to overcome these challenges MBSE and SysML in particular has seen significant adoption at NASA (Gateway, Resource Prospector, Europa Clipper, Space Communications and Navigation [SCaN], Space Launch System [SLS]) especially after the MBSE Pathfinder ('16/'17) and MBSE Infusion And Modernization Initiative (MIAMI, '18/'19) studies. However, these pilot programs and a survey of NASA's use of MBSE conducted by NASA Independent Verification & Validation (IV&V) and Ames Research Center identified areas of critical need, including:
Sharing and version control of models. Integration of SysML of domain specific tools Steep learning curve for users with limited MBSE experience Testing, Verification and Validation with SysML have limited use No tools exist for formally specifying requirements and linking to model properties
With programs such as Gateway and Artemis that require coordination among multiple NASA centers, international space agencies, and commercial partnerships these needs will be amplified. Tool infrastructures that enable integrated support of requirements tracing, design reference points, intelligent reasoning of data and interface constructs are generally not available except within proprietary boundaries. We need tools that support integrated development and model sharing across development environments and that support use across multiple vendors.
","This subtopic would be of relevance to all Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) missions, but of particular interest will be Gateway and Artemis development. Those systems have already adopted the use of MBSE tools and tools sought help reduce potential system integration bottlenecks. Over the next 3 to 5 years, there will be considerable opportunity for small business contributions to be matured and integrated into the support infrastructure as Gateway evolves from concept to development program.

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,T6.05Testing of COTS Systems in Space Radiation Environments,,"The use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) parts in space for electronics is a potential significant enabler for many capabilities during a mission. This subtopic is seeking a better understanding of the feasibility of COTS electronics in space environments. It seeks strategies based on a complete system analysis that include, but not limited only to, failure modes to mitigate radiation induced impacts to systems in the space radiation environment.
As background, spacecraft experience exposure to damaging radiation and that amount of exposure from various sources, (e.g., sun and galactic cosmic radiation sources) increases notably as the spacecraft ventures further away from the Earth’s magnetic field, since the magnetic field offers some level of protection. As spacecraft, and their electronic systems, proceed again to the moon and further into deep space, considerable work has and continues to be done to evaluate and determine how to appropriately protect the astronauts and to shield or otherwise protect various spacecraft, habitats, and their electronic systems, depending upon the needs of the missions.
Many of the most protective physical shielding approaches known result in infrastructure which is too heavy for what is considered acceptable for many missions’ intended launch and spaceflight conditions. Therefore, typically lighter infrastructure shielding is presently being used when and where possible. Spacecraft faring deeper into space for fly-by missions (e.g., New Horizons), orbiters (e.g., Mars Orbiter), or landers (e.g., Mars Rover) are examples of such relatively lightly shielded systems. The lighter shielding sacrifices some radiation protection and therefore results in some limitations in what their electronic systems could do. There are already ongoing projects to upgrade current radiation hardened parts, but these are not COTS items and are expensive to manufacture and to buy. For critical systems that must be operational continuously and which may also have more lightly shielded systems, there is no other option at this time. This subtopic does not seek work of that nature.
Unlike the lightly shielded space environments discussed above, space environments which are highly shielded from radiation, such as is inherently the case for the interiors of manned missions and for habitats where humans live and work, high level radiation hardened systems may not be as necessary even in deeper space beyond most of the present day low earth orbit (LEO) situations. Instead, a less expensive COTS solution may be acceptable for a number of non-critical tasks that are not harmed by power interruptions, hardware failures, radiation upsets, etc. in those environments over what may have been thought likely. In order to assess the feasibility of a COTS solution for those types of highly shielded space environments, this subtopic is seeking proposals.
Successful Small Business Concern/Research Institution teams would be able to do space radiation modeling and a complete analysis of the COTS (e.g., modelling for an appropriate space relevant environment; statistical modeling of the electronic parts themselves and their connections in a system; destructive testing and analysis; and testing in an appropriate space relevant environment [e.g., in particle beams]). Further, since all parts in these systems cannot be individually tested, an understanding of what parts are susceptible to radiation damage is crucial so as to create the list of potential test candidates.
Phase I proposers are expected to develop a plan or strategy that explains and details how they would approach solving the problem that helps NASA mitigate radiation induced failures in the system/components, identify COTS equipment that are likely candidates based on environmentally relevant testing, as well as modeling of interior environment and data analysis of similarly known/used approaches like the Orion vehicle testing (EM-1 when released). They should highlight the innovation in the suggested approach and explain why it would be a better solution over what may presently be used. Additionally, they should also indicate how the proposed strategies could be used commercially if developed. Phase I concept studies are expected raise the TRL to at least a 3/4 when completed. Phase II proposals would use that innovative approach to refine and conduct further relevant interior environmental modeling and conduct the space radiation relevant testing and analysis on the selected COTS parts/systems which could lead toward creating prototypes of the potential commercial items that come from the analysis. The deliverables from a successful Phase II is expected to raise the TRL to 5/6.
",3 to 6,"Prototype, Analysis, Software, Hardware, Research
","Either a prototype or flyable hardware to perform the proposed task. Either software or software reports that show theoretically, the hardware will withstand the space environment with any predictions of failure rates or potential upset rates and mitigation.
","Many systems have never been subjected to replacement with COTS part based systems, either off the shelf systems or specialty designed systems with COTS parts. The list is long and not appropriate for NASA to designate a list. It is up to the proposer to identify what has been done in the past to mitigate COTS parts in a system, if anything.
","This work would benefit all entities flying specialty systems in space. If reduced cost, more reliable and capable systems are needed, then COTS is a pathway to this. It just needs to be confirmed that the system can survive in the space environment.

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,T6.06Spacecraft Water Sustainability through Nanotechnology,"Nanotechnology Innovations for Spacecraft Water Management Applications
","Water recovery from wastewater sources is key to long duration human exploration missions. Without substantial water recovery, life support system launch weights are prohibitively large. Regenerative systems are utilized on the International Space Station (ISS) to recycle water from humidity condensate and urine. The Water Processor Assembly (WPA) accepts distillate from the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) and humidity condensate from condensing heat exchanges. The WPA contains multi-filtration beds to remove inorganic and non-volatile organic contaminants, followed by a catalytic oxidation reactor where low molecular weight organics not removed by the adsorption process are oxidized in the presence of oxygen, elevated temperature, and a catalyst. To stabilize urine and protect components from biofouling and precipitation, a toxic pretreatment formula is added to collected urine. Simple measurements of water composition are made during flight, including conductivity, total organic carbon and iodine concentration. For determination of ionic or organic species in water and wastewater, samples must be returned to earth.
This subtopic solicits for technologies to fill specific gaps in NASA’s water management systems for human spaceflight. Proposals must address needs in one of the three target areas specified. These areas of scope are aligned with the three specific thrusts described within the white paper of the Nanotechnology Signature Initiative (NSI) ""Water Sustainability through Nanotechnology"". Please see references for additional information, including water quality requirements and guidelines.
Increasing Water Availability Using Nanotechnology:Removal of Problematic Contaminants from Processed Wastewater
Two problematic organic compounds are recalcitrant to WPA processing on the ISS. Dimethylsilanediol (DMSD) is a silicon-containing degradation byproduct from siloxane based compounds. DMSD can violate ISS potable water quality standards over time, requiring premature multifiltration (MF) bed replacement. Dimethyl sulfone (DMSO2) is a sulfur-containing metabolic byproduct that has historically been consistently present in ISS potable water delivered to the Oxygen Generation Assembly (OGA) for electrolysis to O2 and H2. DMSO2 accumulates in the OGA water recirculation loop and is thus present in the OGA hydrogen product stream. When fed to the Sabatier reactor this contaminated H2 has been shown to poison the Sabatier catalyst over time from sulfur exposure. The presence of DMSO2 is negatively impacting exploration design requirements and Concepts of Operation (CONOPS) for the Advanced-OGA and the Sabatier subsystems, including periodic automated flushing and trace contaminant getter devices. The development of a technology or method for physicochemical removal of these contaminants, compatible with the ISS WRS/WPA, will benefit both current manned and future exploration missions. Although technical solutions are sought that involve novel utilization of nanotechnology, proposals using more conventional or alternative approaches will also be considered.
Improving the Efficiency of Water Delivery and Use with Nanotechnology:Management and Monitoring of Silver Biocide in Potable Water
NASA is considering using silver as the active biocide in potable water systems for use in future spacecraft. NASA is seeking technologies for delivery, maintenance and monitoring silver in potable water.
NASA seeks technologies to deliver and replenish silver ions in potable water, to maintain a concentration at a chosen set point within a range of 200 to 400 ug/L. The system should be capable of operating in-line, to deliver silver at a flow rate of 0.1 to 0.15 L/min potable water. Furthermore, the device should be able to operate at ambient temperature, pH ranges between 4.5 - 9.0, and system pressures up to 30 psig (200 kPa). Moreover, the device should also be small, robust, lightweight, and have minimal power and consumable mass requirements. Additionally, candidate technologies should be microgravity compatible and have no adverse effects on the potability of the drinking water system. The technology should also be capable of providing continuous, stable and autonomous operation, and be fully functional following periods of long-term system dormancy – up to 1 year. Silver ions may drop out of solution, depositing on fluid lines and tank surfaces, resulting in loss of silver concentration, impacting its efficacy as a residual disinfectant in potable water. Alternative methods are sought to minimize loss of silver ions in spacecraft potable water plumbing systems. NASA is interested in sensing technologies for the in-line measurement of ionic silver in spacecraft potable water systems. Overall, the sensing technology should offer small, robust, lightweight, low-power, compatible design solutions capable of stable, continuous, and autonomous measurements of silver for extended periods of time. Sensors of particular interest would provide:continuous in-line measurement of ionic silver at concentrations between 0 and, at least, 1000 parts per billion (ppb); a minimum detection limit of 10 ppb or less; measurement accuracy of at least 2.5% full scale (1000 ppb); stable measurements in flows up to 0.5 L/min and pipe diameters up to ¾ inch; high sampling frequency, e.g., up to 1 measurement per minute; stable calibration, greater than 3 years preferred; minimal and/or no maintenance requirements; operation at ambient temperature, system pressures up to 30 psig (200 kPa), and a solution pH between 4.5 - 9.0; and finally, a volumetric footprint less than 2000 cubic centimeters. The sensing technology should have little to no impact on the overall volume and concentration of silver being maintained within the spacecraft water system.
Enabling Next-Generation Water Monitoring Systems with Nanotechnology
NASA is seeking miniature analytical systems to measure mineral and organic constituents in potable water and wastewater. NASA is interested in sensor suites capable of simultaneous measurement of inorganic and organic species. Spacecraft applications exist for monitoring species within wastewater (potential waste streams: urine, humidity condensate, Sabatier product water, waste hygiene, and waste laundry water), regenerated potable water and in support of on-board science. Multi-species analyte measurement capability is of interest that would be competitive to standard water monitoring instruments such as ion-chromatography, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy, and high performance liquid chromatography. Components that enable the miniaturization of these monitoring systems, such as microfluidics and small scale detectors, will be considered. Technologies should be targeted to have >3 year service life and >50% size reduction compared to current state of the art. Ideally, monitoring systems should require no hazardous reagents, have long-term calibration stability, and require very little crew time to operate and maintain.
",,"Research, Analysis, Prototype, Hardware
","Phase I Deliverables - Reports demonstrating proof of concept, including test data from proof of concept studies, and concepts and designs for Phase II. Phase I tasks should answer critical questions focused on reducing development risk prior to entering Phase II.
Phase II Deliverables - Delivery of technologically mature hardware, including components and subsystems that demonstrate performance over the range of expected spacecraft conditions. Hardware should be evaluated through parametric testing prior to shipment. Reports should include design drawings, safety evaluation, test data and analysis. Prototypes must be full scale unless physical verification in 1-g is not possible. Robustness must be demonstrated with long term operation and with periods of intermittent dormancy. System should incorporate safety margins and design features to provide safe operation upon delivery to a NASA facility.
","NASA has unique water needs in space that have analogous applications on Earth. NASA’s wastewater collection differs from systems used on Earth in that it is highly concentrated with respect to urine, uses minimal flush water, is separated from solid wastes, and contains highly acidic and toxic pretreatment chemicals. NASA is interested in recovery of potable water from waste water, low toxicity residual disinfection, antifouling treatments for plumbing lines and tanks, ""microbial check valves"" that prevent microbial cross-contamination where water treatment and potable water systems share connections, and miniaturized sensors and monitoring systems for contaminants in potable water and waste water. NASA’s goal is zero-discharge water treatment, targeting 100% water recycling and reuse. Spacecraft traveling away from Earth require the capability of a fully functional water analysis laboratory, including identification and quantification of known and unknown inorganic ions, organics, and microbes, as well as pH, conductivity, total organic carbon and other typical measurements. Spacecraft Water Exposure Guidelines (SWEGs) have been published for selected contaminants. Nanotechnology may offer solutions in all of these application areas.
","This technology could be proven on the ISS and would be useful to long duration human exploration missions, including Gateway, Lunar surface, and Mars, including surface and transit. It is essential and enabling for water to be recycled to reduce launch costs associated with life support consumables. This subtopic is directed at needs identified by the Life Support Systems Capability Leadership Team (CLT) in areas of water recovery and environmental monitoring, functional areas of Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS).

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,T6.07Space Exploration Plant Growth,"Nutrient Recovery from Urine and Wastewater
","Estimates for growing enough plants to support one human's food (dietary calories) suggest that 90-100 kg of fertilizer would be required per person per year. Even if plants were used only for partial life support (1/4 or 1/2 of the oxygen or food), this fertilizer mass would be substantial. NASA seeks methods and approaches for using in situ waste streams, such as urine and waste water to provide important nutrients and fertilizer for plants. Concepts should consider alternate approaches for how urine might be pre-treated to make it more amenable for fertilizer, and how the high levels of sodium typically found in urine might be separated or managed, since most plants are not tolerant to high levels of sodium.
",3 to 5,"Prototype, Hardware, Research
","Phase I proposals should at a minimum deliver proof of concept for retrieving useful plant nutrients and removal / partitioning sodium from urine or ersatz urine wastewater. By the completion of Phase II, we hope to have prototypic or engineering development unit hardware delivered to NASA for the technology. The potential for Phase III funding for spaceflight validation would then be explored.
","Current approaches for fertilizing plants for space depend largely on time-release fertilizer pellets that are mixed in with a solid rooting media (used both in Veggie and APH). This approach is not sustainable for multiple crop cycles and requires that all the fertilizer be delivered from Earth. Hydroponic approaches have been suggested for space (e.g., AES NextSTEP AstroGarden) and will hopefully be tested soon on the International Space Station (ISS), and eventually on surface settings. In this case, fertilizer salts would be mixed with water to provide a nutrient solution for the plants. Growing plants in space would be more sustainable if the cost and amount of fertilizer salts could be reduced by using recycled wastes, including processed urine.

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,T6.07Space Exploration Plant Growth,"Ethylene Gas Sensor
","Ethylene is a 2-carbon alkene gas that has growth regulating effects on plants. Plants can produce ethylene through natural metabolic processes, and this ethylene can accumulate in closed environments (such as closed plant growth chambers) and have undesirable effects on the plants. These effects can include reduced growth, impaired pollen development and/or fertilization, leaf epinasty, flower abortion, accelerated fruit ripening, and more (Abeles et al., 1992). Being hormonal in nature, ethylene can affect plants at very low concentrations, with levels as low as 25 ppb being reported to have subtle effects on some plants. More sophisticated plant growth chambers for space have included ethylene removal systems, such as KMnO4 coated pellets, but this is a consumable material and adds resistance to air circulation in the chamber. Real time ethylene monitoring would allow more judicious use of ethylene removal for controlling plant growth, and save on consumables. NASA seeks a miniature, sensitive (25 ppb), real time or near-real time sensor to monitor ethylene in plant growth environments for space.

The potential for Phase III funding for spaceflight validation with hardware like the Veggie or Advanced Plant Habitat chambers would then be explored.
","Ethylene monitoring has traditionally been conducted using gas chromatography with either flame ionization or photo-ionization detection. However, gas chromatographs can be large instruments and require collection of gas samples, which are then analyzed.

Focus Area 7 Human Research and Health Maintenance,H12.01Radioprotectors and Mitigators of Space Radiation-induced Health Risks,Radioprotectors and Mitigators of Space Radiation-Induced Health Risks,"Space radiation is a significant obstacle when sending humans on long-duration missions beyond low earth orbit. Although various forms for radiation exist in space, astronauts during Lunar or Mars missions will be exposed constantly to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), which consists of high energy particles ranging from protons to extremely heavy ions. Astronaut health risks from space radiation exposure are categorized into cancer, late and early central nervous systems (CNS) effects, and degenerative risks, which include cardiovascular diseases and premature aging. With the current exposure limits for cancer risks, few female astronauts will be able to fly long duration missions without countermeasures.
This subtopic solicits proposals to develop biological countermeasures that mitigate one or several of the radiation risks associated with space travel. Compounds that target common pathways (e.g., inflammation) across aging, cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration would be preferred. Most of the countermeasure developments in the medical arena have focused on mitigating the effects of X- or gamma rays. The proposed project should focus on re-purposing of technology and compounds for high-energy charged-particle applications. Compounds that are under current development or have been proven effective for other applications are both suitable for this subtopic.
In Phase I of the project, the company should test radioprotectors or mitigators using protons or other charged particles at doses simulating exposure to space radiation. This testing can be done with cell models at the location of choice. Deliverables for the Phase I will be data generated from this exposure with the radioprotector selected. After contract award, due to the nature of this research, the contractor should immediately coordinate with their technical monitor for any special considerations for testing. In Phase II of the project, we would expect the company to expand testing radioprotectors or mitigators with combinations of different particles and energies that simulate the space radiation environment.

After contract award, due to the nature of this research, the contractor should immediately coordinate with their technical monitor for any special considerations for testing.
Phase II will test effective radioprotectors or mitigators in space radiation simulated environments (HZE) to determine if they are able to minimize or prevent space radiation risks. Companies should provide a test plan for in vivo evaluation that describes the expected effect from the compound. Testing in NASA-owned space radiation simulation facilities will be an option for Phase II.
","Exposure of crew members to space radiation during Lunar and Mars missions can potentially impact the success of the missions and cause long-term diseases. Space radiation risks include cancer, late and early CNS effects, cardiovascular diseases, and accelerated aging. Abiding by the current exposure limits for cancer risks, few female astronauts will be able to fly long-duration missions. Mitigation of space radiation risks can be achieved with physical (shielding) and biomedical means. This subtopic addresses development of drugs that mitigate one or several of the identified space radiation risks. Countermeasures for adverse health effects from radiation exposure are of interest to Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the radiation therapy community as well.

Focus Area 7 Human Research and Health Maintenance,H12.05Autonomous Medical Operations,Autonomous Medical Operations,"Current medical operations on the International Space Station (ISS) rely significantly on the Mission Control Center (MCC) and telemedicine to enable Crew Health and Performance (CHP). Near real-time communications allow MCC staff (Flight Surgeons, Flight Controllers, etc.) to guide the crew when a medical scenario exceeds the crew’s knowledge, skills or abilities. Prior to launch, crew are trained in the basic operation of the medical assets on the ISS and use detailed procedures to respond to a variety of planned and unplanned events. The training and procedures, however, are limited and do not adequately address the breadth of medical situations that may arise in flight. MCC expertise extends these capabilities allowing the crew to respond to an even larger set of events. Despite this, it is possible that some events will exceed the crew's and MCC’s ability to respond and will require the crew to rapidly return to earth and seek definitive medical care in a hospital.
Mars missions, however, will not have real-time communications with MCC nor will they have a rapid return capability. Round trip communications between the surface of Mars and Earth is approximately 40 minutes and the return trip will be months, which significantly complicates NASA’s current medical operations. Communication bandwidth considerations may also limit data transmission between the crew and MCC even in the event of high acuity medical situations. More specifically, a variety of existing ISS medical operations require the crew to ‘Contact MCC’ or ‘Notify Surgeon’ for additional instructions, a capability that will be significantly reduced on Mars. Examples of existing ISS medical operations can be found within the links found in the references section.
NASA requires new technologies that will enable a greater degree of autonomy and self-reliance for the crew and allow them to operate in a progressively Earth independent manner. These technologies should also be dual-purposed to enable MCC to better monitor and predict adverse conditions. Ideally, these solutions should require minimal mass, volume, power and/or crew time. Examples of technology developments can include, but are not limited to, advanced just-in-time training modalities, enhanced procedure execution technologies (augmented reality), autonomous physiologic monitoring and trend prediction, automated and in-situ diagnostic and image interpretation, multipurpose medical supplies and devices, etc. The best technology solutions will 1) maximize crew autonomy and self-reliance across a wide range of medical operations, 2) demonstrate how technology could be leveraged to prevent adverse medical conditions, and 3) extend the amount of time needed before MCC intervention is required.

Focus Area 8 In-Situ Resource Utilization,"T2.05Advanced Concepts for Lunar and Martian Propellant Production, Storage, Transfer, and Usage",,"This subtopic seeks technologies related to cryogenic propellant (e.g. hydrogen, oxygen, methane) production, storage, transfer, and usage to support NASA's in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) goals. This includes a wide range of applications, scales, and environments consistent with future NASA missions to the Moon and Mars. Anticipated outcome of Phase I proposals are expected to deliver proof of the proposed concept with some sort of basic testing or physical demonstration. Proposals shall include plans for a prototype and demonstration in a defined relevant environment (with relevant fluids) at the conclusion of Phase II. Solicited topics are as follows:
Subgrid Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model that would model spray transport heat transfer and wall interactions during spray heat transfer during cryogenic propellant tank chilldown and fill in microgravity. Three submodels should be developed, including a (1) droplet transport and heat and mass transfer model, (2) fluid-to-wall boiling model covering all pertinent regimes (flash evaporation, film boiling, transition boiling, nucleate boiling, condensation), and (3) model that is used to capture bulk phases (e.g., volume of fluid). There should be seamless coupling between all three submodels. Emphasis should be on cryogenic fluids such as liquid hydrogen, oxygen, methane, and nitrogen. Phase I should have an emphasis on 1-g while Phase II should include microgravity applications. Models must be anchored to experimental cryogenic data. Develop and demonstrate methodologies for recovering propellant from lunar and Martian descent stages that have low fill levels (< 5%) of liquid oxygen, hydrogen, and/or methane mixed with helium. Methodologies can assume liquid extraction (for a short amount of time) or vapor extraction. Possible uses of the fluids could include fuel cells, life support/breathing air, or other applications. Methodologies should focus on the amount of propellant that might be extractable at different purities (prop/helium). Phase I should focus on defining and refining the methodologies for scavenging, as well as defining what should be done to the landers to enable or facilitate later access for scavenging. Phase II should include some sort of a demonstration, perhaps using simulant or similar fluids. Develop and defend a proposed relaxed propellant grade specification for liquid oxygen, liquid methane, and/or liquid hydrogen, allowing higher amounts of water contaminants in the oxygen and hydrogen, and higher amounts of water, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide/dioxide in the methane. Starting with assessment of potential impurities coming out of the ISRU production plant, analysis should evaluate the effects on the liquefaction system, pump and pressure-fed propellant feed system, and engine performance, especially potential stability effects. Phase I should conclude with a proposed relaxed propellant specification for at least one propellant (oxygen or methane priority over hydrogen), with identification of the propulsion component (liquefaction, feed system, injectors, etc.) that has the most sensitivity to the impurities and will therefore drive the limits on the specification. Phase II should include a hardware demonstration of the critical element at a minimum to validate the accuracy of the analytical predictions. Advance non-liquid electrolyte technologies for chemical flow cells (e.g., fuel cells, electrolyzers, flow batteries, etc.) that generate electrical power from a chemical reaction or reconstitute a reaction byproduct into fuels and oxidizer for such a chemical flow cell. These electrolytes are required to be cycled through very low temperatures (< 150 K) during storage to survive a lunar night or cis-lunar travel and recover completely (>98%) mechanical, electrical, and chemical performance. Ideally, these electrolytes would be able to process propellants (hydrogen, oxygen, methane, kerosene, etc.) and either tolerate or recover from exposure to standard propellant contaminants with minimal/no performance loss. Due to the potential for high fluid pressures and vibration loads, any proposal will illustrate how the electrolyte could be mechanically supported to operate hermetically under these conditions. To demonstrate that the electrolyte exceeds the State of Art, the deliverable test article will support an electrical current density of at least 300 mA/cm2 for at least 500 hours, support transient currents > 750 mA/cm2 for at least 30 seconds, and support slew rates > 50 A/cm2/s. Providing test data for the electrolyte performance degradation rate when operated as intended is required with test times >5,000 hours significantly strengthening the proposal. It would be beneficial if the electrolyte operated reversibly with equal efficiently. Liquid electrolytes, loose or contained within a support structure, are excluded from this Scope due to the complications that liquid electrolytes pose for an eventual system during launch.
NASA has plans to purchase services for delivery of payloads to the Moon through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contract. Under this subtopic, proposals may include efforts to develop payloads for flight demonstration of relevant technologies in the lunar environment. The CLPS payload accommodations will vary depending on the particular service provider and mission characteristics. Additional information on the CLPS program and providers can be found at this link: https://www.nasa.gov/content/commercial-lunar-payload-services. CLPS missions will typically carry multiple payloads for multiple customers. Smaller, simpler, and more self-sufficient payloads are more easily accommodated and would be more likely to be considered for a NASA-sponsored flight opportunity. Commercial payload delivery services may begin as early as 2020 and flight opportunities are expected to continue well into the future. In future years it is expected that larger and more complex payloads will be accommodated. Selection for award under this solicitation will not guarantee selection for a lunar flight opportunity.
",2 to 4,"Prototype, Hardware, Software
","Phase I proposals should at minimum deliver proof of the concept, including some sort of testing or physical demonstration, not just a paper study. Phase II proposals should provide component validation in a laboratory environment preferably with hardware (or model subroutines) deliverable to NASA.
Electrolyte technologies for chemical cell product deliverables would be an operational electrochemical test article demonstrating the capability of the electrolyte to support the listed current density by processing the intended propellants when packaged as a flow cell. This test article will have an active area of at least 50 cm2 and would ideally contain multiple cells to demonstrate extensibility to existing stack designs. It would be favorable to include empirical electrochemical performance data of the electrolyte over as much of the pressure range from 5 psia to 3015 psia as possible to illustrate the potential viability range for Lunar applications.
","Cryogenic Fluid Management is a cross-cutting technology suite that supports multiple forms of propulsion systems (nuclear and chemical), including storage, transfer, and gauging, as well as liquefaction of ISRU produced propellants. Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) has identified that Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM) technologies are vital to NASA's exploration plans for multiple architectures, whether it is hydrogen/oxygen or methane/oxygen systems including chemical propulsion and nuclear thermal propulsion. For spray transport and film condensation, there are significant gaps in modeling. For scavenging, only small scale tests have been conducted to remove residual helium from a liquid oxygen tank.
There is currently no standard on propellant grade specification for an ISRU plant.
Existing electrolytes for space applications are limited to a polymeric membrane based on perfluorinated teflon and ceramic electrolyte. While it has the necessary electrochemical and mechanical properties, the polymeric membrane has very tight thermal constraints due to a high moisture content which complicates thermal system designs for lunar systems during transit. It is also very sensitive to chemical contamination. The ceramic electrolyte has significant mechanical and slew rate limitations, but is more resilient to chemical contamination and has a much larger thermal range which allows storage in very cold environments. Once operational and at temperature, either existing electrolyte technology operates in cold lunar regions. Should an off-nominal event occur during the lunar night that results in a cold-soak, neither existing electrolyte technology has a meaningful chance of recovering from the exposure to the low temperatures.
","STMD strives to provide the technologies that are needed to enable exploration of the solar system, both manned and unmanned systems; cryogenic fluid management is a key technology to enable exploration. Whether liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen or liquid oxygen/liquid methane is chosen by Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) as the main in-space propulsion element to transport humans, CFM will be required to store propellant for up to 5 years in various orbital environments. Transfer will also be required, whether to engines or other tanks (e.g., depot/aggregation), to enable the use of cryogenic propellants that have been stored. In conjunction with ISRU, cryogens will have to be produced, liquefied, and stored, the latter two of which are CFM functions for the surface of the Moon or Mars. ISRU and CFM liquefaction drastically reduces the amount of mass that has to be landed on the Moon or Mars.
NASA already has proton exchange-membrane (PEM) based electrochemical hardware in the International Space Station (ISS) Oxygen Generator Assembly and is developing electrochemical systems for space applications through the Evolved Regenerative Fuel Cell. These system designs could be readily adapted to a solid electrolyte with capabilities beyond the existing State of Art for specific applications such as In Situ Resource Utilization, lunar fuel cell power systems, or regenerative fuel cell energy storage systems. As Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) companies have identified primary fuel cell power systems as a required technology, it would be helpful to ensure that there are options available that could survive the lunar night when off-line without active thermal control. This would enable a longer period between missions to re-fuel and recover the electrochemical system.

Focus Area 8 In-Situ Resource Utilization,Z12.01Extraction of Oxygen from Lunar Regolith,Solar Concentrator Technologies for Oxygen Extraction and In-Situ Construction,"Solar concentrators have been used to successfully demonstrate multiple In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) technologies including hydrogen and carbothermal reduction, sintering of surfaces pads, and production of blocks for construction. Terrestrial state of the art solar concentrators are heavy, not designed for easy packaging/shipping and assembly/installation, and can be maintained and cleaned on a periodic basis to maintain performance. For ISRU space applications, NASA is interested in solar concentrators that are able to be packaged into small volumes, are light weight, easily deployed and set up, can autonomously track the sun, and can perform self-cleaning operations to remove accumulated dust. Materials, components, and systems that would be necessary for the proposed technology must be able to operate on the lunar surface: up to 110oC (230oF) during sunlit periods and survive temperatures down to -170oC (-274oF) during periods of darkness. Systems must also be able to operate for at least one year with a goal of 5 years without substantial maintenance in the dusty regolith environment. Proposers should assume that regolith mining operations will be tens of meters away from the solar concentrators, but that regolith processing systems and solar concentrators will be co-located on a single lander. Phase 1 efforts can be demonstrated at any scale, Phase 2 efforts must be scalable up to 11.1 kW of delivered solar energy assuming an incoming solar flux of ~1350 W/m2 while also considering volumetric constraints for launch and landing. Each of the following specific areas of technology interest may be developed as a standalone technology, but proposals that address multiple areas are encouraged.
Lightweight Mirrors/Lenses: Proposals must clearly state the estimated W/kg for the proposed technology. Phase 2 deliverables must be deployed and supported in Earth 1-g (without wind loads) but should include design recommendations for mass reductions for lunar gravity (1/6-g) deployment. Proposals should address the following attributes: high reflectivity, low coefficient of thermal expansion, strength, mass, reliability and cost.
(See Z13.01 - Active and Passive Dust Mitigation Surfacesto propose dust repellent mirror/lens related technologies. This will help to solve issues where dust particles cling to the surface of a mirror or lens and degrade the performance of a solar concentrator.)
Efficient transmission of energy for oxygen/metal extraction: While the solar concentrator will need to move to track the sun, reactors requiring direct thermal energy for oxygen extraction will be in a fixed position and orientation. Concentrated sunlight must be able to be directed to a single or multiple spots to effectively heat or melt the regolith. Proposals must define the expected transition losses from collection to delivery and should capture any assumptions made regarding the distance from collection to delivery.
Sintering end effector: Solar concentrators have been used to demonstrate the fabrication of 3D printed components using regolith as the only feedstock. However, an end effector designed to melt regolith at 1600oC will not be optimized for selective sintering. Proposals responding to this specific technology area must produce a focal point temperature between 1000oC to 1100oC for the purpose of sintering lunar regolith.

Focus Area 8 In-Situ Resource Utilization,Z12.01Extraction of Oxygen from Lunar Regolith,Novel Oxygen Extraction Concepts,"Lunar regolith is approximately 45% oxygen by mass. The majority of the oxygen is bound in silicate minerals. Previous efforts have shown that it is possible to extract oxygen from silicates using various techniques such as carbothermal reduction and molten regolith electrolysis. NASA is interested in developing novel oxygen extraction systems that can be proven to handle large amounts of lunar regolith throughput, while minimizing consumables, mass and energy.
Phase 1 demonstrations can be at any scale, but eventually the technology must be able to demonstrate an average rate of 1.85 kg O2/hr (10 metric tons of Oxygen in 225 days). Phase 2 demonstrations can be subscale, but must define the number of subscale units necessary to achieve an average extraction rate of 1.85 kg O2/hr. Demonstrations do not need to produce actual oxygen gas, but can end at a reaction product that has successfully removed oxygen atoms from the silicate mineral. Proposers need to define any Earth supplied reagents or hardware that might be consumed or need to be recycled and should estimate replenishment or loss rates expected. Proposals should state expected energy requirements (both electrical and thermal) as well as temperatures at which the proposed process will operate. Proposers should estimate Wh/kg 02 for concepts and/or provide a plan to determine that value as part of the effort. Proposers should address how concepts can be shutdown and restarted.

","The carbothermal reduction process was demonstrated at a relevant scale using an automated reactor in 2010. The approach was successful but used many moving parts and was never life tested for the types of durations that will be required on the lunar surface. Molten Regolith Electrolysis has been demonstrated at the bench scale, but current designs lack a means to move regolith in and out of the oxygen extraction zone. Both processes are used terrestrially, but industrial designs do not provide a means to keep gases from escaping to the vacuum of space.
","STMD (Space Technology Mission Directorate) has identified the need for oxygen extraction from regolith. The alternative path, oxygen from lunar water, currently has much more visibility. However, we currently do not know enough about the concentration and accessibility of lunar water to know if it would offer a better return on energy investment than oxygen extracted from the regolith. A lunar water prospecting mission is required to properly assess the utilization potential of water on the lunar surface. Until water prospecting data becomes available, NASA recognizes the need to make progress on the technology needed to extract oxygen from dry lunar regolith.

Focus Area 8 In-Situ Resource Utilization,Z12.01Extraction of Oxygen from Lunar Regolith,Lunar Ice Mining,"We now know that water ice exists on the poles of the Moon from data obtained from missions like the Lunar Prospector, Chandrayaan-1, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS). We know that water is present in Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSR), where temperatures are low enough to keep water in a solid form despite the lack of atmospheric pressure. One challenge with extracting the water is that desorption and sublimation can occur at temperatures as low as 150 Kelvin. The inverse challenge exists with water collection. Unless the water vapor is under pressure, extremely cold temperatures will be necessary to capture it. NASA is seeking methods to acquire lunar water ice from permanently shadowed regions. Proposals must describe a method for extracting and/or collecting lunar water ice that exists at temperatures between 40 to 100 Kelvin and 10-9 torr vacuum.
Phase 1 demonstrations can be at any scale, but eventually the technology must be able to demonstrate an average rate of 2.78 kg H2O/hr (15 metric tons of water in 225 days). Phase 2 demonstrations can be subscale, but must define the number of subscale units necessary to achieve an average extraction rate of 2.78 kg H2O/hr. Proposals should state expected energy requirements (both electrical and thermal). Proposers should assume a mobile platform is considered to be available, but should not be necessary for technology demonstration. Proposers should state their assumptions about water ice concentration. Proposals should describe a tolerance for a trace amount of organics or volatiles that may accumulate on collection surfaces. Proposers should estimate Wh/kg H20 for concepts and/or provide a plan to determine that value as part of the effort. Proposers should address the ability of a concept to be able to operate for at least one year with a goal of 5 years without substantial maintenance.

","Scoops and bucket-wheel excavators have been demonstrated for the collection of unconsolidated material but may not be effective at excavating consolidated regolith-ice composites. The Planetary Volatiles Extractor (PVEx) developed by Honeybee Robotics is the state of the art for heated core drills, but life testing is required to determine the rate of wear due to repeated excavation. Multiple groups have investigated the use of thermal mining methods to separate water from regolith, but the depth of water removed is relatively shallow. Very little work has been performed on the ability to capture water in a lunar environment after it has been released from the surface.
","The current NASA Administrator has referenced water ice as one of the reasons we have chosen the lunar poles as the location to establish a sustained human presence. STMD has identified the need for water extraction from permanently shadowed regions. Multiple mission directorates over the past several years have provided funding for a water prospecting mission so that we can gain the information required to establish an ice mining architecture.

"Focus Area 9 Sensors, Detectors and Instruments",S1.01Lidar Remote Sensing Technologies,,"NASA recognizes the potential of lidar technology to meet many of its science objectives by providing new capabilities or offering enhancements over current measurements of atmospheric and topographic parameters from ground, airborne, and space-based platforms. To meet NASA’s requirements for remote sensing from space, advances are needed in state-of-the-art lidar technology with an emphasis on compactness, efficiency, reliability, lifetime, and high performance. Innovative lidar subsystem and component technologies that directly address the measurement of atmospheric constituents and surface topography of the Earth, Mars, the Moon, and other planetary bodies will be considered under this subtopic. Compact, high-efficiency lidar instruments for deployment on unconventional platforms, such as balloons, SmallSats, and CubeSats are also considered and encouraged.
Proposals must show relevance to the development of lidar instruments that can be used for NASA science-focused measurements or to support current technology programs. Meeting science needs leads to four primary instrument types:
Backscatter - Measures beam reflection from aerosols to retrieve the opacity of a gas. Ranging - Measures the return beam’s time-of-flight to retrieve distance. Doppler - Measures wavelength changes in the return beam to retrieve relative velocity. Differential absorption - Measures attenuation of two different return beams (one centered on a spectral line of interest) to retrieve concentration of a trace gas.

","Phase I research should demonstrate technical feasibility and show a path toward a Phase II prototype unit. Phase II prototypes should be capable of laboratory demonstration and preferably suitable for operation in the field from a ground-based station, an aircraft platform, or any science platform amply defended by the proposer.
","Compact and rugged single-frequency continuous-wave and pulsed lasers operating between 290-nm and 2050-nm wavelengths suitable for lidar. Specific wavelengths are of interest to match absorption lines or atmospheric transmission: 290 to 320-nm (ozone absorption), 450 to 490-nm (ocean sensing), 532-nm, 817-nm (water line), 935-nm (water line), 1064-nm, 1570-nm (CO2 line), 1650-nm (methane line), and 2050-nm (Doppler wind). Architectures involving new developments in diode laser, quantum cascade laser, and fiber laser technology are especially encouraged. For pulsed lasers two different regimes of repetition rate and pulse energies are desired: from 1-kHz to 10-kHz with pulse energy greater than 1-mJ and from 20-Hz to 100-Hz with pulse energy greater than 100-mJ. Laser sources of wavelength at or around 780-nm are not sought this year. Novel approaches and components for lidar receivers such as: integrated optical/photonic circuitry, compact and lightweight Cassegrain telescopes compatible with existing differential absorption lidar (DIAL) and HSRL lidar systems, frequency agile solar blocking filters at 817-nm and/or 935-nm, and scanners for large apertures of telescope of at least 10-cm diameter and scalable to 50-cm diameter. New space lidar technologies that use small and high-efficiency diode or fiber lasers to measure range and surface reflectance of planets or asteroids from >100-km altitude during mapping to < 1-m during landing or sample collection, within size, weight, and power fit into a 4U CubeSat or smaller. New lidar technologies that allow system reconfiguration in orbit, single photon sensitivities and single beam for long distance measurement, and variable dynamic range and multiple beams for near-range measurements. Transformative technologies and architectures are sought to vastly reduce the cost, size, and complexity of lidar instruments. Advances are needed in generation of high pulse energy (>> 1-mJ) from compact (CubeSat size) packages, avoiding the long cavity lengths associated with current solid-state laser transmitter designs. Mass-producible laser designs, perhaps by a hybrid diode/fiber/crystal architecture, are desirable for affordable sensor solutions and reducing parts count. Heat removal from lasers is a persistent problem, requiring new technologies for thermal management of laser transmitters. New materials concepts could be of interest for the reduction of weight for optical benches and telescopes. Distributed transmitter/receiver apertures may offer another option for weight reduction.

"Focus Area 9 Sensors, Detectors and Instruments","S1.04Sensor and Detector Technologies for Visible, IR, Far-IR, and Submillimeter",,"NASA is seeking new technologies or improvements to existing technologies to meet the detector needs of future missions, as described in the most recent decadal surveys:
Earth Science and Applications from Space: http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11820.html(link is external) New Frontiers in the Solar System: http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10432.html(link is external) Astronomy and Astrophysics in the New Millennium: http://www.nap.edu/books/0309070317/html/(link is external)
Technologies for visible detectors are not being solicited this year.
LOW-POWER & LOW-COST READOUT INTEGRATED ELECTRONICS
Photodiode Arrays: In-pixel Digital Readout Integrated Circuit (DROIC) for high dynamic range infrared imaging and spectral imaging (10-60 Hz operation) focal plane arrays to circumvent the limitations in charge well capacity, by using in-pixel digital counters that can provide orders of magnitude larger effective well depth, thereby affording longer integration times.
MKID/TES Detectors: A radiation tolerant, digital readout system is needed for the readout of low temperature detectors such as Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (MKIDs) or other detector types that use microwave frequency domain multiplexing techniques. Each readout channel of the system should be capable of generating a set of at least 1500 carrier tones in a bandwidth of at least 1 GHz with 14 bit precision and 1 kHz frequency placement resolution. The returning frequency multiplexed signals from the detector array will be digitized with at least 12 bit resolution. A channelizer will then perform a down-conversion at each carrier frequency with a configurable decimation factor and maximum individual subchannel bandwidth of at least 50 Hz. The power consumption of a system consisting of multiple readout channels should be at most 20 mW per subchannel or 30 W per 1 GHz readout channel. That requirement would most likely indicate the use of an RF System on a Chip or ASIC with combined digitizer and channelizer functionality.
Bolometric Arrays: Low power, low noise, cryogenic multiplexed readout for large format two-dimensional bolometer arrays with 1000 or more pixels, operating at 65-350 mK. We require a superconducting readout capable of reading two Transition Edge Sensors (TESs) per pixel within a 1 mm-square spacing. The wafer-scale readout of interest will be capable of being indium-bump bonded directly to two-dimensional arrays of membrane bolometers. We require row and column readout with very low crosstalk, low read noise \, and low detector Noise Equivalent Power degradation.
Thermopile Detector Arrays: Mars Climate Sounder (MCS), the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment (DLRE), and the Polar Radiant Energy in the Far Infrared Experiment (PREFIRE) are NASA space-borne radiometers that utilize custom thermopile detector arrays. Next-generation radiometers will use larger format thermopile detector arrays, indium bump bonding to hybridize the detector arrays to the Readout Integrated Circuits (ROICs), low input-referred noise, and low power consumption. ROICs compatible with 128x64 element Bi-Sb-Te thermopile arrays with low 1/f noise, an operating temperature between 200-300 K, radiation hardness to 300 krad and on-ROIC analog-to-digital converter (ADC) will be desirable.
LIDAR DETECTORS
Development of single-mode fiber-coupled extended-wavelength integrated InGaAs detectors/preamplifiers for heterodyne detection lidar at 2-2.1 um wavelengths with near shot-noise-limited performance for less than 3 mW local oscillator power, quantum efficiency > 90% over 2-2.1 um wavelengths, and bandwidth > 5 GHz. Specifications should be demonstrated in heterodyne detection experiments.
IR & Far-IR/SUBMILLIMETER-WAVE DETECTORS
Novel Materials and Devices: New or improved technologies leading to measurement of trace atmospheric species (e.g., CO, CH4, N2O) or broadband energy balance in the IR and far-IR from geostationary and low-Earth orbital platforms. Of particular interest are new direct detector or heterodyne detector technologies made using high temperature superconducting films (YBCO, MgB2) or engineered semiconductor materials, especially 2-Dimensional Electron Gas (2DEG) and Quantum Wells (QW).
Array Receivers: Development of a robust wafer level packaging/integration technology that will allow high-frequency capable interconnects and allow two dissimilar substrates (i.e., Silicon and GaAs) to be aligned and mechanically 'welded' together. Specially develop ball grid and/or Through Silicon Via (TSV) technology that can support submillimeter-wave (frequency above 300 GHz) arrays.
Receiver Components: Local Oscillators capable of spectral coverage 2-5 THz; Output power up to > 2 mW; Frequency agility with > 1 GHz near chosen THz frequency; Continuous phase-locking ability over the THz tunable range with < 100 kHz line width. Both solid-state (low parasitic Schottky diodes) as well as Quantum Cascade Lasers (for f > 2 THz) will be needed. Components and devices such as mixers, isolators, and orthomode transducers, working in the THz range, that enable future heterodyne array receivers are also desired. GaN based power amplifiers at frequencies above 100 GHz and with PAE > 25% are also needed. ASIC based SoC (System on Chip) solutions are needed for heterodyne receiver backends. ASICs capable of binning > 6 GHz intermediate frequency bandwidth into 0.1-0.5 MHz channels with low power dissipation < 0.5 W would be needed for array receivers
",,"Prototypes and analysis
","All of the detectors and associated readout and other technologies can be built as prototypes to advance TRL.Detailed analysis of the operation and tradeoff space would also be very helpful.
","Efficient multi-pixel readout electronics are needed both for room temperature operation as well as cryogenic temperatures. We can produce millions-of-pixel detector arrays at infrared wavelengths up to about 14 microns, only because there are readout circuits (ROIC) available on the market. Without these, high-density, large-format infrared arrays such as Quantum Well Infrared Photodiode, HgCdTe, and Strained Layer Superlattice would not exist. The Moore's Law corollary for pixel count describes the number of pixels for the digital camera industry as growing in an exponential manner over the past several decades, and the trend is continuing. The future of long-wave detectors is moving toward tens of thousands of pixels and beyond. Readout circuits capable of addressing their needs do not exist, and without them the astronomical community will not be able to keep up with the needs of the future. These technology needs must be addressed now, or we are at risk of being unable to meet the science requirements of the future.
Commercially available readout integrated circuits (ROICs) typically have well depths of less than 10 million electrons. 6-9bit, ROACH-2 board solutions with 2000 bands, <10kHz bandwidth in each are SOA. IR detector systems are needed for Earth imaging based on the recently release Earth Decadal Survey. Direct detectors with D~10^9 cm-rtHz/W achieved in this range. Technologies with new materials that take advantage of cooling to the 30-100K range are capable of D~10^12 cm-rtHz/W. Broadband (>15%) heterodyne detectors that can provide sensitivities of 5 to 10 times the quantum limit in the submillimeter-wave range while operating at 30-77 K are an improvement in the state or art due to higher operating temperature. Detector array detection efficiency < 20% at 532nm (including fill factor and probability of detection) for low after pulsing, low dead time designs is SOA. Far-IR bolometric heterodyne detectors are limited to 3dB gain bandwidth of around 3 GHz. Novel superconducting material such a MgB2 can provide significant enhancement of up to 9 GHz IF bandwidth. Cryogenic Low Noise Amplifiers (LNAs) in the 4-8 GHz bandwidth with thermal stability are needed for Focal Plane Arrays, Origins Space Telescope (OST) instruments, Origins Survey Spectrometers (OSS), microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs), Far-infrared Imager and Polarimeters (FIP), Heterodyne Instrument on OST (HERO), and the Lynx Telescope. DC power dissipation should be only a few mW. Another frequency range of interest for LNAs is 0.5-8.5 GHz. This is useful for Heterodyne Receiver for OST (HERO). Other NASA systems in the Space Geodesy Project (SGP) would be interested in bandwidths up to 2-14 GHz. 15-20 dB Gain and <5 Kelvin Noise over the 4-8 GHz bandwidth has been demonstrated. -Currently, all space borne heterodyne receivers are single pixel. Novel architectures are needed for ~100 pixel arrays at 1.9 THz The current State of the Art readout circuit is capable of reading one TES per pixel in a 1 mm square area. 2D arrays developed by NIST have been a boon for current NASA programs. However, NIST has declined to continue to produce two-dimensional circuits, or to develop one capable of two TES-per-pixel readout. This work is extremely important to NASA’s filled, kilopixel bolometer array program. Two dimensional cryogenic readout circuits are analogous to semiconductor Readout Integrated Circuits operating at much higher temperatures. We can produce millions-of-pixel detector arrays at infrared wavelengths up to about 14 microns, only because there are readout circuits (ROIC) available on the market. Without these, high-density, large-format infrared arrays such as Quantum Well Infrared Photodiode, HgCdTe, and Strained Layer Superlattice would not exist. For Lidar detectors, extended wavelength InGaAs detector/preamplifier packages operating at 2-2.1 micron wavelengths with high quantum efficiency (> 90%) operating up to about 1 GHz bandwidth are available as are packages operating up to about 10 GHz with lower quantum efficiency.Detectors that have > 90% quantum efficiency over the full bandwidth from near DC to > 5 GHz and capable of achieving near-shot-noise limited operation are not currently available.

Supporting technologies that would help enable X-ray Surveyor mission that requires the development of X-ray microcalorimeter arrays with much larger field of view, ~105-106 pixels, of pitch ~25-100 µm, and ways to read out the signals.

All joints between segments of the shielding enclosure must also be superconducting. Improved long-wavelength blocking filters are needed for large-area, X-ray microcalorimeters. Filters with supporting grids are sought that, in addition to increasing filter strength, also enhance EMI shielding (1 - 10 GHz) and thermal uniformity for decontamination heating. X-ray transmission of greater than 80% at 600 eV per filter is sought, with infrared transmissions less than 0.01% and ultraviolet transmission of less than 5% per filter. Means of producing filter diameters as large as 10 cm should be considered.

Advanced sensors for the detection of elementary particles (atoms, molecules and their ions) and electric and magnetic fields in space and associated instrument technologies are often critical for enabling transformational science from the study of the sun's outer corona, to the solar wind, to the trapped radiation in Earth's and other planetary magnetic fields, and to the atmospheric composition of the planets and their moons.

CLPS missions will typically carry multiple payloads for multiple customers. Smaller, simpler, and more self-sufficient payloads are more easily accommodated and would be more likely to be considered for a NASA-sponsored flight opportunity. Commercial payload delivery services may begin as early as 2020 and flight opportunities are expected to continue well into the future.

For details of the specific requirements see the National Research Council report ""Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022"" (http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/2013decadal/), hereafter referred to as the Planetary Decadal Survey). Of particular interest are technologies to support future missions under the New Frontiers and Discovery programs.
Specifically, this subtopic solicits instrument development that provides significant advances in the following areas, broken out by planetary body:
Mars - Sub-systems relevant to current in situ instrument needs (e.g., lasers and other light sources from UV to microwave, X-ray and ion sources, detectors, mixers, mass analyzers, etc.) or electronics technologies (e.g., field programmable gate array (FPGA) and application-specfic integrated circuit (ASIC) implementations, advanced array readouts, miniature high voltage power supplies). Technologies that support high precision in situ measurements of elemental, mineralogical, and organic composition of planetary materials are sought. Conceptually simple, low risk technologies for in situ sample extraction and/or manipulation including fluid and gas storage, pumping, and chemical labeling to support analytical instrumentation. Seismometers, mass analyzers, technologies for heat flow probes, and atmospheric trace gas detectors are sought. Improved robustness and g-force survivability for instrument components, especially for geophysical network sensors, seismometers, and advanced detectors (intensified charge-coupled devices (iCCDs), photomultiplier tube (PMT) arrays, etc.). Instruments geared towards rock/sample interrogation prior to sample return. Venus - Sensors, mechanisms, and environmental chamber technologies for operation in Venus's high temperature, high-pressure environment with its unique atmospheric composition. Approaches that can enable precision measurements of surface mineralogy and elemental composition and precision measurements of trace species, noble gases and isotopes in the atmosphere. Small Bodies - Technologies that can enable sampling from asteroids and from depth in a comet nucleus, improved in situ analysis of comets. Imagers and spectrometers that provide high performance in low light environments. Dust environment measurements and particle analysis, small body resource identification, and/or quantification of potential small body resources (e.g., oxygen, water and other volatiles, hydrated minerals, carbon compounds, fuels, metals, etc.). Advancements geared towards instruments that enable elemental or mineralogy analysis (such as high-sensitivity X-ray and UV-fluorescence spectrometers, UV/fluorescence systems, scanning electron microscopy with chemical analysis capability, mass spectrometry, gas chromatography and tunable diode laser sensors, calorimetry, imaging spectroscopy, and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune - Components, sample acquisition, and instrument systems that can enhance mission science return and withstand the low-temperatures/high-pressures of the atmospheric probes during entry. The Moon - This topic seeks advancement of concepts and components to develop a Lunar Geophysical Network as envisioned in the Planetary Decadal Survey. Understanding the distribution and origin of both shallow and deep moonquakes will provide insights into the current dynamics of the lunar interior and its interplay with external phenomena (e.g., tidal interactions with Earth). The network is envisioned to be comprised of multiple free-standing seismic stations which would operate over many years in even the most extreme lunar temperature environments. Technologies to advance all aspects of the network including sensor emplacement, power, and communications in addition to seismic, heat flow, magnetic field and electromagnetic sounding sensors are desired.
Novel instrument concepts are encouraged particularly if they enable a new class of scientific discovery. Technology developments relevant to multiple environments and platforms are also desired. Proposers should show an understanding of relevant space science needs and present a feasible plan to fully develop a technology and infuse it into a NASA mission.
NASA has plans to purchase services for delivery of payloads to the Moon through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contract. Under this subtopic, proposals may include efforts to develop payloads for flight demonstration of relevant technologies in the lunar environment. The CLPS payload accommodations will vary depending on the particular service provider and mission characteristics. Additional information on the CLPS program and providers can be found at this link: https://www.nasa.gov/content/commercial-lunar-payload-services. CLPS missions will typically carry multiple payloads for multiple customers. Smaller, simpler, and more self-sufficient payloads are more easily accommodated and would be more likely to be considered for a NASA-sponsored flight opportunity. Commercial payload delivery services may begin as early as 2020 and flight opportunities are expected to continue well into the future. In future years it is expected that larger and more complex payloads will be accommodated. Selection for award under this solicitation will not guarantee selection for a lunar flight opportunity.

"Focus Area 9 Sensors, Detectors and Instruments",S1.08Suborbital Instruments and Sensor Systems for Earth Science Measurements,,"NASA seeks measurement capabilities that support current satellite and model validation, advancement of surface-based remote sensing networks, and targeted Airborne Science Program and ship-based field campaign activities as discussed in the Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Science (ROSES) solicitation. Data from such sensors also inform process studies to improve our scientific understanding of the Earth System. In-situ sensor systems (airborne, land, and water-based) can comprise stand-alone instrument and data packages; instrument systems configured for integration on ship-based (or alternate surface-based platform) and in-water deployments, NASA’s Airborne Science aircraft fleet or commercial providers, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), or balloons, ground networks; or end-to-end solutions providing needed data products from mated sensor and airborne/surface/subsurface platforms. An important goal is to create sustainable measurement capabilities to support NASA’s Earth science objectives, with infusion of new technologies and systems into current/future NASA research programs. Instrument prototypes as a deliverable in Phase II proposals and/or field demonstrations are highly encouraged.
Complete instrument systems are generally desired, including features such as remote/unattended operation and data acquisition, and minimum size, weight, and power consumption. All proposals must summarize the current state of the art and demonstrate how the proposed sensor or sensor system represents a significant improvement over the current state of the art.
Specific desired sensors or mated platform/sensors include:
A hyperspectral radiometry system with polarization capability covering the UV-Vis-NIR wavelength range (350-865 with a minimum resolution of 5 nm; 2.5-nm desired). The instrument shall measure hyperspectral above water upwelling radiance, sky radiance, downwelling irradiance and polarization state of the atmosphere and ocean, and be capable of autonomously positioning itself with respect to the sun for optimized measurement geometry. An in situ hyperspectral ocean water absorption instrument (ocean submersible to 300 m) covering the UV-Vis wavelength range (resolution of ≤2nm for 350-750 nm and ≤5nm for 300-350nm) with an accuracy better than 0.005 m-1 or 5% of the signal and precision better than 0.001 m-1. Instrument design must mitigate/correct for the confounding effects of scattering and fluorescence. In-situ measurements of ocean particulate backscatter, depolarization, beam attenuation, and diffuse attenuation coefficients relevant for combined ocean-atmosphere lidar remote sensing (355, 473, 486, 532, 1064 nm wavelengths and 170-180° scattering angle with ≤1 degree angular resolution). In situ polarized hyperspectral UV-Vis volume scattering function (VSF) instrument (ocean submersible to 300 m) covering the angular range close to 0 degrees and, more importantly so, as far as 180 degrees (with≤2 degree angular resolution). Instrument should have ability to measure (at least) horizontal and vertical aspects of linear polarization. Degree of resolution in angles and wavelength can be decreased for instrument portability and robustness (such as for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) deployments). Portable hyperspectral UV-Vis-NIR radiometric calibration system with a stabilized optical light source for verification of field radiometer stability by traceable NIST standards with variable flux levels. System must include thermal stabilization for the instrument to be independent of ambient temperature for evaluation of radiometric stability as function of time. Innovative, high-value sensors directly targeting a stated NASA need (including aerosols and trace gases) may also be considered. Proposals must identify a specific, relevant NASA subject matter expert.

"Focus Area 9 Sensors, Detectors and Instruments",S1.09Cryogenic Systems for Sensors and Detectors,Ultra-Lightweight Dewars,"NASA seeks extremely lightweight thermal isolation systems for scientific instruments. An important example is a large cylindrical, open top dewar to enable large, cold balloon telescopes. In one scenario, such a dewar would be launched warm, and so would not need to function at ambient pressure, but at altitude, under ~4 millibar external pressure, it would need to contain cold helium vapor. The ability to rapidly pump and hold a vacuum at altitude is necessary. An alternative concept is that the dewar would be launched at operating temperature, with some or all of the needed liquid helium. In both cases, heat flux through the walls should be less than 0.5 Watts per square meter, and the internal surfaces must be leak tight against superfluid helium. Initial demonstration units of greater than 1 meter diameter and height are desired, but the technology must be scalable to an inner diameter of 3 – 4 meters with a mass that is a small fraction of the net lift capability of a scientific balloon (~2000 kg).
",3 to 4,"Prototype Hardware
","A working prototype of the scale described is desired.
","Currently available liquid helium dewars have heavy vacuum shells that allow them to be operated in ambient pressure. Such dewars have been used for balloon-based astronomy, as in the Absolute Radiometer for Cosmology, Astrophsyics, and Diffuse Emission (ARCADE) experiment. However, the current dewars are already near the limit of balloon lift capacity, and cannot be scaled up to the required size for future astrophysics measurements.
","Science traceability: NASA Strategic plan 2018, Objective 1.1: Understand the Sun, Earth, Solar System, and Universe.
The potential for ground-based infrared astronomy is extremely limited. Even in airborne observatories, such as SOFIA, observations are limited by the brightness of the atmosphere and the warm telescope itself. However, high altitude scientific balloons are above enough of the atmosphere that, with a telescope large enough and cold enough, background-limited observations are possible. The ARCADE project demonstrated that at high altitudes, it is possible to cool instruments in helium vapor. Development of ultra-lightweight dewars that could be scaled up to large size, yet still be liftable by a balloon would enable ground-breaking observational capability.

Collecting samples for a variety of science purposes is also sought. These include samples that allow for determination of the chemical and physical properties of the source ocean, samples for detailed characterization of the organics present in the gas and particle phases, and samples for analysis for biomarkers indicative of life. Front-end system technologies include sample collection systems and subsystems capable of capture, containment, and/or transfer of gas, liquid, ice, and/or mineral phases from plumes to sample processing and/or instrument interfaces. Technologies for characterization of collected sample parameters including mass, volume, total dissolved solids in liquid samples, and insoluble solids.

These technologies would enable high-priority sampling and potential sample return from the plumes of Enceladus with a fly-by mission. This would be a substantial cost savings over a landed mission. Europa - Life detection approaches optimized for evaluating and analyzing the composition of ice matrices with unknown pH and salt content. Instruments capable of detecting and identifying organic molecules (in particular biomolecules), salts and/or minerals important to understanding the present conditions of Europa's ocean are sought (such as high resolution gas chromatograph or laser desorption mass spectrometers, dust detectors, organic analysis instruments with chiral discrimination, etc.).

Improvements to instruments capable of gravity (or other) measurements that might constrain properties such as ocean and ice shell thickness will also be considered. Titan - Life detection approaches optimized for searching for biosignatures and biologically relevant compounds in Titan's lakes, including the presence of diagnostic trace organic species, and also for analyzing Titan's complex aerosols and surface materials. Mechanical and electrical components and subsystems that work in cryogenic (95 K) environments; sample extraction from liquid methane/ethane, sampling from organic 'dunes' at 95 K and robust sample preparation and handling mechanisms that feed into mass analyzers are sought.

"Focus Area 9 Sensors, Detectors and Instruments",T8.04Metamaterials and Metasurfaces Technology for Remote Sensing Applications,Research and Development Opportunities for Metamaterials,"Metamaterials are man-made (synthesized) composite materials whose electromagnetic, acoustic, optical, etc. properties are determined by their constitutive structural materials and their configurations. Metamaterials can be precisely tailored to manipulate electromagnetic waves, including visible light, microwaves, and other parts of the spectrum, in ways that no natural materials can. The development of metamaterials continues to redefine the boundaries of materials science. In the field of electromagnetic research and beyond, these materials offer excellent design flexibility with their customized properties and their tunability under external stimuli. These properties enable Metamaterials to be a game changer for many technologies needing reduced size, weight, and power (SWaP), enhanced tunability and reconfigurability. Topics of interest for NASA's applications are listed below.
Beam shaping with metamaterials (at optical as well as microwave wavelengths). Control of emission and absorption with metamaterials (for applications such as tunable lenses). Engineering mid-infrared and optical nonlinearities with metamaterials. Development of microwave and millimeter-wave metamaterials: radar scanning systems, flat panel antennas, mobile communication antennas, novel magnetic materials and high-performance absorbing and shielding materials for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and reduction of radio frequency interference (RFI). Thin-film technology incorporated with metamaterial nanocomposites to collect light from wide angles and absorption over wide spectrum. Tunable, reconfigurable metamaterials using liquid crystal medium (Applications: IR and Optical spectrometers). Development of artificial ferrites and artificial dielectrics using metamaterial concepts to design electrically small, lightweight, and efficient RF components. Transformation electromagnetic techniques with advances in fabricating metamaterials (Applications: microwaves and infrared wavelength sensors).
",1 to 3,"Prototype, Analysis, Hardware, Research
","It is expected at the end of year one for selected teams to provide a comprehensive feasibility study to address an applicable area of interest within the field of metamaterial technology. Deliverables in subsequent years could involve prototypes and demonstration of performance.
","Metamaterial research is interdisciplinary and involves such fields as electrical engineering, electromagnetics, classical optics, solid state physics, microwave and antenna engineering, optoelectronics, material sciences, as well as nanoscience and semiconductor engineering. Potential applications of metamaterials are diverse and include: optical filters, remote aerospace applications, sensor detection, radomes, and lenses for high-gain antennas. Metamaterials also offer the potential to create superlenses, which could allow imaging below the diffraction limit that is the minimum resolution that can be achieved by conventional glass lenses. Transformation optics is a technique that simplifies the modeling of optical devices by altering the coordinate system to control the trajectories of light rays. At microwave frequencies, the first, imperfect invisibility cloak was realized in 2006.
","Metamaterial technology has the biggest potential to impact the future of space borne instrumentation by reducing size, weight, and power (SWaP) as well as the overall cost of future space missions. There is especially a need for these improved capabilities in the development of instruments for Planetary and the Earth Science missions to reduce their cost. Due to the nature of metamaterials, there are a multitude of possible applications for this technology. For example, applications of metamaterials for remote sensing include tunability, complex filtering, light channeling/trapping, superbeaming, and determination of optical angular momentum modes via metamaterials.

Focus Area 10 Advanced Telescope Technologies,S2.01Proximity Glare Suppression for Astronomical Direct Detection of Exoplanets,Control of Scattered Starlight with Coronagraphs and Starshades,"This subtopic addresses the unique problem of imaging and spectroscopic characterization of faint astrophysical objects that are located within the obscuring glare of much brighter stellar sources. Examples include planetary systems beyond our own, the detailed inner structure of galaxies with very bright nuclei, binary star formation, and stellar evolution. Contrast ratios of one million to ten billion over an angular spatial scale of 0.05 - 1.5 arcsec are typical of these objects. Achieving a very low background requires control of both scattered and diffracted light. The failure to control either amplitude or phase fluctuations in the optical train severely reduces the effectiveness of starlight cancellation schemes.
This innovative research focuses on advances in coronagraphic instruments, starlight cancellation instruments, and potential occulting technologies that operate at visible and near infrared wavelengths. The ultimate application of these instruments is to operate in space as part of a future observatory mission concepts such as the Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) and Large Ultraviolet Optical Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR). Measurement techniques include imaging, photometry, spectroscopy, and polarimetry. There is interest in component development and innovative instrument design, as well as in the fabrication of subsystem devices to include, but not limited to, the following areas:
Starlight Suppression Technologies:
Hybrid metal/dielectric and polarization apodization masks for diffraction control of phase and amplitude for coronagraph scaled starshade experiments. Low-scatter, low-reflectivity, sharp, flexible edges for control of solar scatter in starshades. Low-reflectivity coatings for flexible starshade optical shields. Systems to measure spatial optical density, phase inhomogeneity, scattering, spectral dispersion, thermal variations, and to otherwise estimate the accuracy of high-dynamic range apodizing masks. Methods to distinguish the coherent and incoherent scatter in a broadband speckle field.
Wavefront Measurement and Control Technologies:
Small stroke, high precision, deformable mirrors and associated driving electronics scalable to 10,000 or more actuators (both to further the state-of-the-art towards flight-like hardware and to explore novel concepts). Multiple deformable mirror technologies in various phases of development and processes are encouraged to ultimately improve the state-of-the-art in deformable mirror technology. Process improvements are needed to improve repeatability, yield, and performance precision of current devices. Multiplexers with ultra-low power dissipation for electrical connection to deformable mirrors Low-order wavefront sensors for measuring wavefront instabilities to enable real-time control and post-processing of aberrations. Thermally and mechanically insensitive optical benches and systems.
Optical Coating and Measurement Technologies:
Instruments capable of measuring polarization cross-talk and birefringence to parts per million. Polarization-insensitive coatings for large optics. Methods to measure the spectral reflectivity and polarization uniformity across large optics. Methods to apply carbon nanotube coatings on the surfaces of the coronagraphs for broadband suppression from visible to near infrared (NIR).
",3 to 5,"Prototype, Analysis, Hardware, Research
","This subtopic solicits proposals to develop components that improve the footprint, robustness, power consumption, reliability, and wavefront quality of high-contrast, low-temporal bandwidth, adaptive optics systems. These include ASIC drivers that easily integrate with the deformable mirrors, improved connectivity technologies, as well as high-actuator count deformable mirrors with high-quality, ultrastable wavefronts.
It also seeks coronagraph masks that can be tested in ground-based high-contrast testbeds in place at a number of institutions, as well as devices to measure the masks to inform optical models. The masks include transmissive scalar, polarization-dependent, and spatial apodizing masks including those with extremely low reflectivity regions that allow them to be used in reflection.
The subtopic seeks samples of optical coatings that reduce polarization and can be applied to large optics, and methods and instruments to characterize them over large optical surfaces.
Finally, for starshades, the subtopic seeks low reflectivity and potentially diffraction-controlling edges that minimize scattered sunlight while also remaining robust to handling and cleaning. Low-reflectivity optical coatings that can be applied to the surfaces for the large (hundreds of square meters) optical shield are also desired.
","Coronagraphs have been demonstrated to achieve high contrast in moderate bandwidth in laboratory environments. Starshades will enable even deeper contrast over broader bands but to date have demonstrated deep contrast in narrow band light. The extent to which the telescope optics will limit coronagraph performance is a function of the quality of the optical coating and the ability to control polarization over the full wavefront. Neither of these technologies is well characterized at levels required for 1e10 contrast. Wavefront control using deformable mirrors is critical. Controllability and stability to picometer levels is required. To date, deformable mirrors have been up to the task of providing contrast approaching 1e10, but they require thousands of wires, and overall wavefront quality and stroke remain concerns.
","These technologies are directly applicable to the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), coronagraph instrument (CGI), and the HabEx and LUVOIR concept studies.

","Future space astronomy missions from ultraviolet to millimeter wavelengths will push the state of the art in current optomechanical technologies. Size, dimensional stability, temperature, risk, manufacturability, and cost are important factors, separately and in combination. The Large Ultraviolet Optical Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) calls for deployed apertures as large as 15 m in diameter, the Origins Space Telescope (OST) for operational temperatures as low as 4 K, LUVOIR and the Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) for exquisite optical quality. Methods to construct large telescopes in space are also under development. Additionally, sunshields for thermal control and starshades for exoplanet imaging require deployment schemes to achieve 30-70 m class space structures.
This subtopic addresses the need to mature technologies that can be used to fabricate 10-20 m class, lightweight, ambient or cryogenic flight qualified observatory systems and subsystems (telescopes, sunshields, starshades). Proposals to fabricate demonstration components and subsystems with direct scalability to flight systems through validated models will be given preference. The target launch volume and expected disturbances, along with the estimate of system performance, should be included in the discussion. Novel metrology solutions to establish and maintain optical alignment will also be accepted.

Metrology:
Techniques to verify dimensional stability requirements at sub-nanometer level precisions (10 – 100 picometers) Techniques to monitor and maintain telescope optical alignment for on-ground and in-orbit operation
A successful proposal shows a path toward a Phase II delivery of demonstration hardware scalable to 5-meter diameter for ground test characterization. Proposals should show an understanding of one or more relevant science needs, and present a feasible plan to fully develop the relevant subsystem technologies and to transition into future NASA program(s).

","To accomplish NASA’s high-priority science at all levels (flagship, probe, Medium-Class Explorers (MIDEX), Small Explorers (SMEX), rocket and balloon) requires low-cost, ultra-stable, normal incidence mirror systems with low mass-to-collecting area ratios. Where a mirror system is defined as the mirror substrate, supporting structure, and associated actuation and thermal management systems. After performance, the most important metric for an advanced optical system is affordability or areal cost (cost per square meter of collecting aperture). Current normal incidence space mirrors cost $4 million to $6 million per square meter of optical surface area. This research effort seeks to improve the performance of advanced precision optical components while reducing their cost by 5 to 50 times, to between $100K/m2 to $1M/m2.
Specific metrics are defined for each wavelength application region:
Aperture Diameter for all wavelengths, except Far-IR
Monolithic: 1 to 8 meters Segmented: 3 to 20 meters
For UV/Optical
Areal Cost < $500K/m2 Wavefront Figure < 5 nm RMS (via passive design or active deformation control) Wavefront Stability < 10 pm/10 min First Mode Frequency 60 to 500 Hz Actuator Resolution < 1 nm RMS Optical Path-length Stability < 1 pm/10,000 seconds for precision metrology Areal density < 15 kg/m2 (< 35 kg/m2 with backplane) Operating Temperature Range of 250 to 300K
For Far-IR
Aperture diameter 1 to 4 m (monolithic), or 5 to 10 m (segmented) Telescope diffraction-limited at <30 microns at operating temperature 4 K Cryo-Deformation < 100 nm RMS Areal cost < $500K/m2 Production rate > 2 m2 per month Areal density < 15 kg/m2 (< 40 kg/m2 with backplane) Thermal conductivity at 4 K > 2 W/m*K Survivability at temperatures ranging from 315 K to 4 K
For EUV
Surface Slope < 0.1 micro-radian
Also needed is ability to fully characterize surface errors and predict optical performance.
Proposals must show an understanding of one or more relevant science needs, and present a feasible plan to develop the proposed technology for infusion into a NASA program: sub-orbital rocket or balloon; competed SMEX or MIDEX; or, Decadal class mission. Successful proposals will demonstrate an ability to manufacture, test and control ultra-low-cost optical systems that can meet science performance requirements and mission requirements (including processing and infrastructure issues).

At typical balloon cruise altitudes (100,000 to 130,000 ft.), 99%+ of the atmospheric is below the balloon and the attenuation due to the remaining atmosphere is small, especially in the near ultraviolet band and in the infrared bands near 2.7 and 4.25 µm. The lack of atmosphere nearly eliminates scintillation and allows the resolution potential of relatively large optics to be realized, and the small amount of atmosphere reduces scattered light and allows observations of brighter objects even during daylight hours.

Page 22, Last Paragraph of NASA Telescope Facilities within the Summary Section: Balloon- and rocket-borne telescopes offer a cost-effective means of studying planetary bodies at wavelengths inaccessible from the ground.6 Because of their modest costs and development times, they also provide training opportunities for would-be developers of future spacecraft instruments. Although NASA’s Science Mission Directorate regularly flies balloon missions into the stratosphere, there are few funding opportunities to take advantage of this resource for planetary science, because typical planetary grants are too small to support these missions. A funding line to promote further use of these suborbital observing platforms for planetary observations would complement and reduce the load on the already oversubscribed planetary astronomy program. Page 203, 5th paragraph, Section titled Earth and Space-Based Telescopes: Significant planetary work can be done from balloon-based missions flying higher than 45,000 ft. This altitude provides access to electromagnetic radiation that would otherwise be absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere and permits high-spatial-resolution imaging unaffected by atmospheric turbulence. These facilities offer a combination of cost, flexibility, risk tolerance, and support for innovative solutions that is ideal for the pursuit of certain scientific opportunities, the development of new instrumentation, and infrastructure support. Given the rarity of giant-planet missions, these types of observing platforms (high-altitude telescopes on balloons and sounding rockets) can be used to fill an important data gap.154, 155,156.

Focus Area 10 Advanced Telescope Technologies,S2.03Advanced Optical Systems and Fabrication/Testing/Control Technologies for EUV/Optical and IR Telescope,Large UV/Optical (LUVOIR) and Habitable Exoplanet (HabEx) Missions,"Potential UV/Optical missions require 4 to 16 meter monolithic or segmented primary mirrors with < 5 nm RMS surface figures. Active or passive alignment and control is required to achieve system level diffraction limited performance at wavelengths less than 500 nm (< 40 nm RMS wavefront error, WFE). Additionally, potential Exoplanet mission, using an internal coronagraph, requires total telescope wavefront stability on order of 10 pico-meters RMS per 10 minutes. This stability specification places severe constraints on the dynamic mechanical and thermal performance of 4 meter and larger telescope. Potential enabling technologies include: active thermal control systems, ultra-stable mirror support structures, athermal telescope structures, athermal mirror struts, ultra-stable low CTE/high-stability joints, and vibration compensation.
Mirror areal density depends upon available launch vehicle capacities to Sun-Earth L2 (i.e. 15 kg/m2 for a 5 m fairing EELV vs. 150 kg/m2 for a 10 m fairing SLS). Regarding areal cost, a good goal is to keep the total cost of the primary mirror at or below $100M. Thus, an 8-m class mirror (with 50 m2 of collecting area) should have an areal cost of less than $2M/m2. And, a 16-m class mirror (with 200 m2 of collecting area) should have an areal cost of less than $0.5M/m2.
Key technologies to enable such a mirror include new and improved:
Mirror substrate materials and/or architectural designs Processes to rapidly fabricate and test UVO quality mirrors Mirror support structures, joints and mechanisms that are athermal or zero CTE at the desired scale Mirror support structures, joints and mechanisms that are ultra-stable at the desired scale Mirror support structures with low-mass that can survive launch at the desired scale Mechanisms and sensors to align segmented mirrors to < 1 nm RMS precisions Thermal control (< 1 mK) to reduce wavefront stability to < 10 pm RMS per 10 min Dynamic isolation (> 140 dB) to reduce wavefront stability to < 10 pm RMS per 10 min

Regarding precision, this subtopic encourages proposals to develop technology which makes a significant advance the ability to fabricate and test an optical system.
One area of current emphasis is the ability to non-destructively characterize CTE homogeneity in 4-m class Zerodur and 2-m class ULE mirror substrates to an uncertainty of 1 ppb/K and a spatial sampling of 100 x 100. This characterization capability is needed to select mirror substrates before they undergo the expense of turning them into a light-weight space mirror.
Regarding stability, to achieve high-contrast imaging for exoplanet science using a coronagraph instrument, systems must maintain wavefront stability to < 10 pm RMS over intervals of ~10 minutes during critical observations. The ~10-minute time period of this stability is driven by current wavefront sensing and control techniques that rely on stellar photons from the target object to generate estimates of the system wavefront. This subtopic aims to develop new technologies and techniques for wavefront sensing, metrology, and verification and validation of optical system wavefront stability.
Current methods of wavefront sensing include image-based techniques such as phase retrieval, focal-plane contrast techniques such as electric field conjugation and speckle nulling, and low-order and out-of-band wavefront sensing that use non-science light rejected by the coronagraph to estimate drifts in the system wavefront during observations. These techniques are limited by the low stellar photon rates of the dim objects being observed (~5 - 11 Vmag), leading to 10s of minutes between wavefront control updates.
New methods may include: new techniques of using out-of-band light to improve sensing speed and spatial frequency content, new control laws incorporating feedback and feedforward for more optimal control, new algorithms for estimating absolute and relative wavefront changes, and the use of artificial guide stars for improved sensing signal to noise ratio and speed.
Current methods of metrology include edge sensors (capacitive, inductive, or optical) for maintaining segment cophasing, and laser distance interferometers for absolute measurement of system rigid body alignment. Development of these techniques to improve sensitivity, speed, and component reliability is desired. Low power, high-reliability electronics are also needed.
Finally, metrology techniques for system verification and validation at the picometer level during integration and test (I&T) are needed. High speed spatial and speckle interferometers are currently capable of measuring single-digit picometer displacements and deformations on small components in controlled environments. Extension of these techniques to large-scale optics and structures in typical I&T environments is needed.

Application to telescope alignment metrology has been demonstrated on testbeds, to TRL4 for nanometer accuracy. Picometer accuracy for telescopes awaits demonstration.
Edge sensors are in use on segmented ground telescopes, but not yet on space telescopes. New designs are needed to provide picometer sensitivity and millimeter range in a space qualified package.

1) On-axis or axisymmetric designs are typically used for (space) optical comm and imaging, which inherently are problematic due to the central obscuration.
2) Off-axis designs provide superior optical performance due to the clear aperture, however, are rarely considered due to complex design, manufacturing, and metrology procedures needed.
","Optical Communication enable high data-rate downlink of science data. The initial motivation for this scalable off-axis optical design approach is for bringing high-performance reflective optics within reach of laser communication projects with limited resources. However, this exact optical hardware is applicable for any diffraction limited, athermalized science imaging applications. Any science mission could potentially be able to select from a “catalog” of optical aperture systems that would already have (flight) heritage and reduced risks.

The current state-of-art of mirror fabrication technology for X-Ray missions is very expensive and time consuming. Additionally, a number of improvements such as 10 arc-second angular resolutions and 1 to 5 m2 collecting area are needed for this technology. Likewise, the stray-light suppression system is bulky and ineffective for wide-field of view telescopes.
In this area, we are looking to address the multiple technologies including: improvements to manufacturing (machining, rapid optical fabrication, slumping or replication technologies), improved metrology, performance prediction and testing techniques, active control of mirror shapes, new structures for holding and actively aligning of mirrors in a telescope assembly to enable X-Ray observatories while lowering the cost per square meter of collecting aperture and effective design of stray-light suppression in preparation for the Decadal Survey of 2020. Additionally, we need epoxies to bond mirrors that are made of silicon. The epoxies should absorb IR radiation with wavelengths between 1.5 um and 6 um that traverses silicon with little or no absorption, and therefore can be cured quickly with a beam of IR radiation. Currently, X-Ray space mirrors cost $4 million to $6 million per square meter of optical surface area. This research effort seeks a cost reduction for precision optical components by 5 to 50 times, to less than $1M to $100 K/m2.

Lowering the areal cost of coating determines if a proposed mission could be funded in the current cost environment. The most common forms of coating used on precision optics are anti-reflective (AR) coating and high reflective coating.
The current coating technology of optical components needed to support the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal process. Historically, it takes 10 years to mature mirror technology from TRL-3 to 6. To achieve these objectives requires sustained systematic investment.
The telescope optical coating needs to meet low temperature operation requirement. It’s desirable to achieve 35 degrees Kelvin in future.
A number of future NASA missions require suppression of scattered light. For instance, the precision optical cube utilized in a beam-splitter application forms a knife-edge that is positioned within the optical system to split a single beam into two halves. The scattered light from the knife-edge could be suppressed by CNT coating. Similarly, the scattered light for gravitational-wave application and lasercom system where the simultaneous transmit/receive operation is required, could be achieved by highly absorbing coating such as CNT. Ideally, the application of CNT coating needs to achieve:
Broadband (visible plus Near IR), reflectivity of 0.1% or less Resist bleaching of significant albedo changes over a mission life of at least 10 years Withstand launch conditions such vibe, acoustics, etc. Tolerate both high continuous wave (CW) and pulsed power and power densities without damage. ~10 W for CE and ~ 0.1 GW/cm2 density, and 1 kW/nanosecond pulses Adhere to the multi-layer dielectric or protected metal coating including Ion Beam Sputtering (IBS) coating

These missions could benefit greatly by freeform optics as they provide non-rotationally symmetric optics which allow for better packaging while maintaining desired image quality. Currently, the design and fabrication of freeform surfaces is costly. Even though various techniques are being investigated to create complex optical surfaces, small-size missions highly desire efficient small packages with lower cost that increase the field of view and expand operational temperature range of un-obscured systems.

Focus Area 10 Advanced Telescope Technologies,S2.05Technology for the Precision Radial Velocity Measurement Technique,"Components, assemblies, and subsystems for Extreme Precision Radial Velocity Measurements and Detection of Extrasolar Planets","Astronomical spectrographs have proven to be powerful tools for exoplanet searches. When a star experiences periodic motion due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet, its spectrum is Doppler-modulated in time. This is the basis for the Precision Radial Velocity (PRV) method, one of the first and most efficient techniques for detecting and characterizing exoplanets. Since spectrographs have their own drifts which must be separated from the periodic Doppler shift, a stable reference is always needed for calibration. Optical Frequency Combs (OFCs) and line-referenced etalons are capable of providing the instrument precision needed for detecting and characterizing Earth-like planets in the Habitable Zone of their Sun-like host stars. While “stellar jitter” (a star’s photospheric velocity contribution to the RV signal) is unavoidable, the contribution to the error budget from Earth’s atmosphere would be eliminated in future space missions. Thus, there is a need to develop robust spectral references with Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) suitable for space qualified operation to calibrate the next generation of high-resolution spectrographs with precision corresponding to < ~1 cm/s over multiple years of observations.
This subtopic solicits proposals to develop cost effective component and subsystem technology for low SWaP, long-lived, robust implementation of radial velocity measurement instruments both on the ground and in space. Research areas of interest include but are not limited to:

Integrated photonic spectrographs that meet PRV specifications (e.g. wavelength coverage, resolution, throughput, and polarization). These devices should be able to accept multiple fibers - at least two for the science light and simultaneous calibration light source. Ideally, they should be able to include on-chip cross-dispersion to eliminate bulk optics. PRV spectrograph calibration sources, particularly optical frequency combs (a.k.a. “astrocombs”) from the UV through the NIR (~350 nm – ~2400 nm) with ~10-30 GHz mode spacing, potentially self-referenced, or line stabilized for Allan Deviation <1E-11 over 100 seconds to years Spectral flattening to provide uniform power across the spectral band covered by the instrument Spectral broadening to obtain wide spectral coverage, preferably octave-spanning to enable self-referencing Integrated photonic solutions including nonlinear waveguides, microresonators or other comb generators, pump lasers, and f-2f beat-note generation Low phase-noise solutions Tunability of comb lines to scan spectrograph detectors for pixel characterization Optical etalons with similar requirements for stability as the frequency combs High efficiency photonic lanterns Advanced fiber scrambling techniques for modal noise reduction Software for advanced statistical techniques to mitigate effects of telluric absorption and stellar jitter on RV precision and accuracy.

Phase II will emphasize hardware/software development with delivery of specific hardware or software products for NASA targeting demonstration operations at a ground-based telescope in coordination with the lead NASA center. Phase II deliverables include a working prototype or engineering model of the proposed product/platform or software, along with documentation of development, capabilities, and measurements (showing specific improvement metrics), documents and tools as necessary. Proposed prototypes shall demonstrate a path towards a flight-capable platform. Opportunities and plans should also be identified and summarized for potential commercialization or NASA infusion.
","The classical bulk optic spectrographs that are traditionally used for PRV science impose architectural constraints due to their large mass and limited optical flexibility. The spectrograph is the single element that if replaced with a photonic alternative could dramatically alter the course of astronomical instrumentation. Integrated Photonic Spectrographs (IPS) are wafer thin devices that could reduce instrument volume by up to three orders of magnitude. Furthermore, high resolving power spectrographs (R~150,000) with simultaneous UV, visible, and NIR coverage and exquisite long-term stability are required for PRV studies. Spectrometers that are fiber-fed with high illumination stability, excellent wavelength calibration, and precise temperature and pressure control represent the immediate future of precision RV measurements.
As spectrograph stability imposes limits on how precisely the Radial Velocity (RV) can be measured, spectral references play a critical role in characterizing and ensuring this precision. Only Laser Frequency Combs (LFCs) and line-referenced Fabry-Pérot etalons are capable of providing the broad spectral coverage and long term (years) stability needed for extreme PRV detection of exoplanets. While both frequency combs and etalons can deliver high precision spectrograph calibration, the former requires relatively complex and sophisticated hardware in the visible portion of the spectrum. Visible band frequency combs for astronomy (a.k.a. astrocombs) were initially based on mode-locked laser comb technology. However, the intrinsic free spectral range of these instruments, 100s of MHz to 1 GHz, is too fine to be resolved by astronomical spectrographs of R~150,000 or less. Thus, mode filtering of comb lines to create a more spectrally sparse calibration grid is necessary. The filtering step introduces complexity and additional sources of instability to the calibration process, as well as instrument assemblies too large in mass and volume for flight.
Commercial fiber laser astrocombs covering 450 - 1400 nm at 25 GHz line spacing and <3 dB intensity variations over the entire bandwidth are available for ground-based astronomical spectrographs and have been developed for HARPS-S and ESPRESSO RV instruments. However, the cost for these systems is often so prohibitive that recent RV spectrograph projects such as CARMENES and Keck Planet Finder either do not use a frequency comb or include it only as a future upgrade, owing to the cost impact on the project.
Alternatively, frequency combs produced by Electro-Optic Modulation (EOM) of a laser source have been demonstrated at observatories for PRV studies in the near-IR. EOM combs produce modes spaced at a RF modulation frequency, typically 10-30 GHz, and are inherently suitable as ground-based astrocombs. Significantly, EOM combs avoid the line filtering step of commercial mode-locked fiber laser combs. Comb frequency stabilization can be accomplished in a variety of ways, including referencing the laser pump source to a molecular absorption feature or another frequency comb. Where octave spanning EOM combs are available, f-2f self-referencing provides the greatest stability.
EOM combs must be spectrally broadened to provide the octave bandwidth necessary for f-2f stabilization for stability traceable to the Standard International (SI) second. This is accomplished through pulse amplification followed by injection into Highly Non-Linear Fiber (HNLF) or nonlinear optical waveguides, but the broadening process is accompanied by multiplication of the optical phase noise from the EOM comb modulation signal and must be optically filtered. Also, at these challenging microwave pulse repetition rates, the pulse duty-cycle requires pulse amplification to 4-5 Watts of average optical power in order to generate the high enough peak intensity needed for nonlinear broadening. This necessitates use of high power, non-telecom amplifiers that are more prone to lifetime issues, making EOM combs not optimal for flight either. It is important to note that very little comb light is actually required on the spectrograph detectors for calibration. In fact, most of the generated comb light must be deliberately attenuated to avoid detector saturation.
Power consumption of the frequency comb calibration system will be a significant driver of mission cost for space-based PRV systems, and motivates the development of a comb system that operates with less than 20 Watts of spacecraft power. Thus, for flight applications, it is highly desirable to develop frequency comb technology with low power consumption, ~10 GHz mode spacing, compact size, broad (octave spanning) spectral grasp across both the visible and NIR, phase noise insensitivity, stability traceable to the definition of the SI second, and very importantly, long life.
","The NASA Strategic Plan (2018) and Space Mission Directorate Science Plan (2014) both call for discovery and characterization of habitable Earth analogs and the search for biosignatures on those worlds. These goals were endorsed and amplified upon in the recent National Academy of Science (NAS) Exoplanet Report which emphasized that a knowledge of the orbits and masses is essential to the complete and correct characterization of potentially habitable worlds. PRV measurements are needed to follow up on the transiting worlds discovered by Kepler, K2, and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The interpretation of the transit spectra which James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will obtain will depend on knowledge of a planet’s surface gravity which comes from its radius (from the transit data) and its mass (from PRV measurements or in some cases Transit Timing Variations). Without knowledge of a planet's mass, the interpretation of its spectrum is subject to many ambiguities.
These ambiguities will only be exacerbated for the direct imaging missions such as the proposed Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) and Large Ultraviolet Optical Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) flagships which will obtain spectra of Earth analogs around a few tens to hundreds of stars. Even if a radius can be inferred from the planet's brightness and an estimate of its albedo, the lack of a dynamical mass precludes any knowledge of the planet's density, bulk composition, and surface gravity which are needed to determine, for example, absolute gas column densities. Moreover, a fully characterized orbit is challenging to determine from just a few direct images and may even be confused in the presence of multiple planets. Is a planet in a highly eccentric orbit habitable or not? Only dynamical (PRV) measurements can provide such information. Thus, highly precise and highly stable PRV measurements are absolutely critical to the complete characterization of habitable worlds.
The NAS report also noted that measurements from space might be a final option if the problem of telluric contamination cannot be solved. The Earth’s atmosphere will limit precise radial velocity measurements to ~10 cm/s at wavelengths longer than ~700 nm and greater than 30 cm/s at >900 nm, making it challenging to mitigate the effects of stellar activity without a measurement of the color dependence due to stellar activity in the PRV time series. A space-based PRV mission, such as has been suggested in the NASA EarthFinder mission concept study, may be necessary. If so, the low SWaP technologies developed under this SBIR program could help enable space-based implementations of the PRV method.

Focus Area 11 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,S3.05Terrestrial Balloons and Planetary Aerial Vehicles,Planetary Aerial Vehicles for Venus,"NASA is interested in scientific investigation of the Venus atmosphere and planetary surface using aerial vehicles. Aerial vehicles are expected to carry scientific payloads at Venus that will perform in-situ investigations of its atmosphere, surface and interior structure. The 2018 Venus Aerial Platforms Study report identified several key science investigations that are ideally suited to aerial platforms. The areas of scientific interest include: Atmospheric Gas Composition, Cloud and Haze Particle Characterization, Atmospheric Structure, Surface Imaging and Geophysical Investigations. Venus features a challenging atmospheric environment that significantly impacts the design of aerial vehicles. Proposals are sought in the following areas:
Aerial Vehicle Platforms for Venus - Concepts for Lighter-than-Air (e.g., balloons, airships) and Heavier-than-Air (e.g., fixed wing, rotary wing) vehicles are encouraged. The current state of the art in Venus aerial vehicles has been designed to operate within the altitude range of 50 to 60 km above the surface where the atmosphere is similar to the lower Earth atmosphere. The science objectives described in the Venus Aerial Platform study indicate that a wider range of altitudes is strongly desirable.
There are 3 areas of interest in this call:
Aerial systems that can maneuver throughout the range 40 to 70 km altitude for a long duration. The aerial platform should be able to operate on the sunlit side of Venus and be able to transit the night side and survive several circumnavigations around the planet. The proposal should describe how the vehicle concept would be deployed into the atmosphere and operated for its mission. The proposal does not have to address thermal design of the payload (if it is suspended under a balloon), but should include concepts for addressing the thermal requirements for the aerial platform. The atmospheric temperature ranges from 145C at 40 km to -10C at 60 km altitude. The aerial platform is not expected to operate extensively at the lower altitudes but should be capable of operating for short durations at high temperatures. Concepts for any of the following capabilities of aerial vehicle are encouraged:
Technology demonstration with science payload less than 5 kg. Pathfinder mission with science payload less than 30 kg. Flagship mission with science payload up to 60 kg.
Other areas of interest include low cost approaches to:
Solar heated balloon systems to carry small science payloads (i.e. less than 10 kg payload) from 60 to 70 km altitude which would operate only on the sunlit side. These should be relatively simple systems that could operate collectively as a swarm system. Deep atmospheric probes, deployed from aerial vehicles, to measure diurnal variations in the deep atmosphere of Venus. These could be deployed at different locations around Venus to capture atmospheric differences between day and night. Concepts for vehicles or neutrally buoyant probes that perform vertical descents, or guided/gliding descents to the surface are desired.
",2 to 3,"Prototype, Analysis, Research
","It is expected that a Phase I effort will consist of a system-level design and a proof-of-concept experiment on one or more key components.
Deliverables shall be a final report describing the results of the concept analysis, demonstration of any key technology developed and photos of any prototypes that were built and tested.
","Terrestrial based aerial vehicles, including lighter-than-air and heavier-than-air are mature technologies and continue making advancements in capability, reliability and autonomy. But these need adaptation for operation in the Venus environment.
A gap exists in aerial vehicle technology that allows for variable altitude investigation in the Venus atmospheric environment. Floating at a fixed altitude means the vehicle is basically collecting samples of the same atmosphere each time it performs a collection since it floats with the wind. Having variable altitude capability allows significantly better investigation into the atmospheric structure. Variable altitude balloon concepts have been developed to operate over the altitude range of 50 to 60 km. New science goals defined in the Venus Aerial Platforms Study have indicated that stretching this operating range over 40 to 60 km is needed. This is a significant challenge because of the high atmospheric temperature at the 40 km altitude.
","Relevance: Applied Physics Laboratory’s (APL) Dragonfly mission selection by New Frontiers shows there is significant interest in aerial vehicles for science investigations. It is in NASA's interests through the SBIR program to continue fostering innovative ideas to develop mission concepts to explore Venus using aerial vehicles.
JPL's Solar System Mission Formulation Office and the NASA Science Mission Directorate's Planetary Science Division advocate Venus aerial vehicle platform development. Furthermore, there are many enthusiastic supporters of exploring other worlds with aerial platforms throughout NASA.
Science Traceability: The 2018 Venus Aerial Platforms Study report identified several key science investigations that are ideally suited to aerial platforms. The areas of scientific interest include: Atmospheric Gas Composition, Cloud and Haze Particle Characterization, Atmospheric Structure, Surface Imaging and Geophysical Investigations. The variable altitude aerial vehicle platform is ideal for investigating these science goals and objectives.

Long duration balloon flights currently utilize satellite communication systems to relay science and operations data from the balloon to ground based control centers.

Improvements in bit rate performance, reduction in size and mass of existing systems, or reductions in cost of high bit rate systems are needed.

Since these balloons are hand constructed, there is potential for gas loss due to leaks through the seams or fittings, or permeation through the balloon envelope that is made of linear low-density polyethylene.

Focus Area 11 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,"S3.08Command, Data Handling, and Electronics",,"NASA's space based observatories, fly-by spacecraft, orbiters, landers, and robotic and sample return missions, require robust command and control capabilities. Advances in technologies relevant to command and data handling and instrument electronics are sought to support NASA's goals and several missions and projects under development.
The 2020 subtopic goals are to develop platforms for the implementation of miniaturized highly integrated avionics and instrument electronics that:
Are consistent with the performance requirements for NASA missions. Minimize required mass/volume/power as well as development cost/schedule resources. Can operate reliably in the expected thermal and radiation environments.
Successful proposal concepts should significantly advance the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, proposals developing hardware should indicate an understanding of the intended operating environment, including temperature and radiation. Note that environmental requirements vary significantly from mission to mission. For example, some low earth orbit missions have a total ionizing dose (TID) radiation requirement of less than 10 krad(Si), while planetary missions can have requirements well in excess of 1 Mrad(Si).
Specific technologies sought by this subtopic include:
Fault-tolerant computing: Processor and eco-system (ASIC & Design IP) designed to mitigate single event upsets (SEUs) – Technologies are sought that implement fault tolerant computers leveraging industry standard processor instruction set architectures (ISPIAs) and interfaces. Although not limited to, there is particular interest in leveraging the reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles of RISC-V architecture. Offerors should identify coding language of IP cores, use of architecture specific modules which would limit the ability to swap hardware chipsets, options for scaling fault tolerance, code/gate size and features versus power and speed. Offerors working application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) efforts should identify possible foundries and their radiation tolerance processes. Offerors offering processing units should identify operating system / toolchain support. Offerors proposing design intellectual property (IP) should identify mitigation technique(s) including burdens on code development time / hardware performance and size.
Multiple output point of load power regulator: This module, preferably implemented utilizing one or more controller ASICs, will source a minimum of 3 settable output voltages when provided with standard spacecraft power bus input. Output voltages shall be independently settable to any voltage between 3.3V and .9 V with efficiency of at least 95%. Regulation, noise filtering and other operational specifications should be commensurate with industry standards for space-based systems. Output current in the 10A range to handle field-programmable gate array (FPGA) core requirements. The module should provide standard spacecraft power supply features, including over voltage protection, fault tolerance, load monitoring, sequencing, synchronization, soft start and should allow control and status monitoring by a remote power system controller. Using fewer external components is also highly desirable. There is also interest in a capability to provide data over power line communication to the converter for control and monitoring functions. The offeror should determine radiation tolerance levels achievable utilizing commercially available processes and indicate, in the proposal, the radiation tolerance goals.
High density high-reliability interconnections: A high reliability connector or interconnect mechanism that can operate in space environments (vacuum, vibration) and deliver hundreds of signal/power connections while using as little physical board area as possible is desired. The design should handle everything from carrying power to high speed (10+ Gbps) impedance controlled connections. The design should be scalable in different sizes to accommodate fewer connections and save board space. Low insertion force is desirable. Right angle and stacking design options should be considered.
",3 to 5,"Prototype, Hardware, Software
","Desired Phase 2 deliverables for fault tolerant computing architectures are IP cores / ASIC designs implemented using an appropriate hardware design language (VHDL or Verilog) that have been demonstrated as an integrated system. Any required system software should be available, preferably as open source, to provide compilers, debuggers, and operating systems to the architecture. The fault tolerance of the architecture should be demonstrated.
Desired Phase 2 deliverable for the multiple output point of load switcher is a prototype multi-output point of load regulator. The regulator should be integrated onto a test board and be performance tested under varying resistive, capacitive, and transient load conditions.
Desired Phase 2 deliverables for the high density high-reliability interconnect are prototypes of the connection system (different size, orientations, etc.). The connector should be integrated onto a test board where its performance (speed, cross talk, etc.) can be verified.
","There is a need for a broader range of offerings for fault tolerant computing architectures. This includes the need for viable options between performance, size (gate count) and power tradeoffs. There are currently a few sources of fault tolerant computing, and additional variety would help reduce costs for future NASA missions. Fault tolerant computing enables robust autonomous systems to be designed and implemented. Furthermore, recent commercial processor architecture developments offer improved performance and a broader array of performance options, and fault tolerant variants of these could significantly benefit NASA missions.
There are multiple output point of load converters available from commercial companies. The existing commercial parts require many external components eliminating their space savings. Commercial parts are not built on radiation tolerant processes.
Current connectors are too large, especially for small satellites and CubeSats. As the size of the printed circuit boards has shrunk, the percent of board space being used by the I/O connectors has become unacceptable. The connectors are taking away from circuitry and sensors that could be providing additional functionality and science products. High density commercial connectors also tend to be lacking in their general ruggedness, outgassing, and ability to prevent intermittent connections in high vibration environments like orbital launches.
","Fault tolerant / autonomous computing architectures are relevant to increasing science return and lowering costs for missions across all Science Mission Directorate (SMD) divisions. However, the benefits are most significant for miniaturized instruments and subsystems that must operate in harsh environments. These missions include interplanetary CubeSats and smallsats, outer planets instruments, and heliophysics missions to harsh radiation environments. For these missions, the inherent fault tolerance would provide an additional level of protection on top of the radiation tolerance of the FPGA or ASIC on which the computing system is implemented. Additionally, for missions with large communication delays, the inherent fault tolerance can limit the need for ground intervention.
Multi-output point of load converters and high-density high-reliability interconnects are relevant to miniaturizing electronics. Miniaturized flight electronics allows one to fit more functionality into less volume, allowing smaller spacecraft to perform science that was previously done by larger satellites. These missions include interplanetary CubeSats and smallsats, outer planets instruments, and heliophysics missions.

Focus Area 11 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,S4.04Extreme Environments Technology,,"This subtopic addresses NASA's need to develop technologies for producing space systems that can operate without environmental protection housing in the extreme environments of NASA missions. Key performance parameters of interest are survivability and operation under the following conditions:
1) Very low temperature environments (e.g., temperatures at the surface of Titan and of other Ocean Worlds as low as -180 deg C; and in permanently shadowed craters on the Moon), or
2) Combination of low temperature and radiation environments (e.g., surface conditions at Europa of -180 deg C with very high radiation), or
3) Very high temperature, high pressure and chemically corrosive environments (e.g., Venus surface conditions having very high pressure and temperature of 486 deg C).
NASA is interested in expanding its ability to explore the deep atmospheres and surfaces of planets, asteroids, and comets through the use of long-lived (days or weeks) balloons and landers. Survivability in extreme high temperatures and high pressures is also required for deep atmospheric probes to the giant planets. Proposals are sought for technologies that are suitable for remote sensing applications at cryogenic temperatures, and in-situ atmospheric and surface explorations in the high temperature, high pressure environment at the Venusian surface (485°C, 93 atmospheres), or in low-temperature environments such as those of Titan (-180°C), Europa (-220°C), Ganymede (-200°C), Mars, the Moon, asteroids, comets and other small bodies. Also, Europa-Jupiter missions may have a mission life of 10 years and the radiation environment is estimated at 2.9 Mega-rad total ionizing dose (TID) behind 0.1 inch thick aluminum. Proposals are sought for technologies that enable NASA's long duration missions to extreme wide-temperature and cosmic radiation environments. High reliability, ease of maintenance, low volume, low mass, and low out-gassing characteristics are highly desirable. Special interest lies in development of the following technologies that are suitable for the environments discussed above:
Wide temperature range precision mechanisms, e.g., beam steering, scanner, linear and tilting multi-axis mechanisms Radiation-tolerant/radiation-hardened low-power, low-noise, mixed-signal mechanism control electronics for precision actuators and sensors Wide temperature range feedback sensors with sub-arcsecond/nanometer precision Long life, long stroke, low power, and high torque force actuators with sub-arc-second/nanometer precision Long life bearings/tribological surfaces/lubricants High temperature energy storage systems High-temperature actuators and gear boxes for robotic arms and other mechanisms Low-power and wide-operating-temperature radiation-tolerant/ radiation hardened RF electronics Radiation-tolerant/radiation-hardened low-power/ultra-low power, wide-operating-temperature, low-noise mixed-signal electronics for space-borne systems such as guidance and navigation avionics and instruments Radiation-tolerant/radiation-hardened power electronics Radiation-tolerant/radiation-hardened electronic packaging (including shielding, passives, connectors, wiring harness and materials used in advanced electronics assembly)
Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II hardware demonstration, and when possible, deliver a demonstration unit for functional and environmental testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.
NASA has plans to purchase services for delivery of payloads to the Moon through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contract. Under this subtopic, proposals may include efforts to develop payloads for flight demonstration of relevant technologies in the lunar environment. The CLPS payload accommodations will vary depending on the particular service provider and mission characteristics. Additional information on the CLPS program and providers can be found at this link: https://www.nasa.gov/content/commercial-lunar-payload-services. CLPS missions will typically carry multiple payloads for multiple customers. Smaller, simpler, and more self-sufficient payloads are more easily accommodated and would be more likely to be considered for a NASA-sponsored flight opportunity. Commercial payload delivery services may begin as early as 2020 and flight opportunities are expected to continue well into the future. In future years it is expected that larger and more complex payloads will be accommodated. Selection for award under this solicitation will not guarantee selection for a lunar flight opportunity.
",3 to 5,"Prototype, Hardware
","Deliverables include proof of concept working prototypes that demonstrate the innovations defined in the proposal and enable direct operation in extreme environments.
","Future NASA missions to high priority targets in our solar system will require systems that have to operate at extreme environmental conditions. NASA missions to the surfaces of Europa and other Ocean Worlds bodies will be exposed to temperatures as low as -180 deg C and radiation levels that are at megarad levels. Operation in permanently shadowed craters on the Moon is also a region of particular interest. In addition, NASA missions to the Venus surface and deep atmospheric probes to Jupiter or Saturn will be exposed to high temperatures, high pressures, and chemically corrosive environments.
Current state-of-practice for development of space systems for the above missions is to place hardware developed with conventional technologies into bulky and power-inefficient environmentally protected housings. The use of environmental protection housing will severely increase the mass of the space system, limit the life of the mission and the corresponding science return. This solicitation seeks to change the state of the practice by support technologies that will enable development of lightweight, highly efficient systems that can readily survive and operate in these extreme environments without the need for the environmental protection systems.
","Relevance to SMD (Science Mission Directorate) is high.
Low temperature survivability is required for surface missions to Titan (-180 deg C), Europa (-220 deg C), Ganymede (-200 deg C), small bodies and comets. Mars diurnal temperatures range from -120 deg C to +20 deg C. For the Europa Clipper baseline concept, with a mission life of 10 years, the radiation environment is estimated at 2.9 megarad total ionizing dose (TID) behind 100 mil thick aluminum. Lunar equatorial region temperatures swing from -180 deg C to +130 deg C during the lunar day/night cycle, and shadowed lunar pole temperatures can drop to -230 deg C.
Advanced technologies for high temperature systems (electronics, electro-mechanical and mechanical) and pressure vessels are needed to ensure NASA can meet its long duration (days instead of hours) life target for its science missions which operate in high temperature and high pressure environments.

Focus Area 11 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,S4.05Contamination Control and Planetary Protection,,"The planetary protection and contamination control subtopic focuses on mission-enabling and capability-driven technologies to improve NASA's ability to prevent forward and backward contamination. Forward contamination is the transfer of viable organisms from Earth to another body. Backward contamination is the transfer of material posing a biological threat back to Earth's biosphere. NASA is seeking innovative technologies or applications of technologies to facilitate meeting portions of forward and backward contamination requirements to include:
Improvements to spacecraft cleaning and sterilization that remain compatible with spacecraft materials and assemblies, Prevention of re-contamination and cross-contamination throughout the spacecraft lifecycle, Improvements to detection and verification of organic compounds and biologicals on spacecraft, to include microbial detection and assessments for viable organism and DNA-based verification technologies to encompass sampling devices, sample processing, and sample analysis pipelines, and Active in-situ recontamination/decontamination approaches (e.g., in-situ heating of sample containers to drive off volatiles prior to sample collection) and in-situ/in-flight sterilization approaches (e.g., UV or plasma) for surfaces. Enabling end-to-end sample return functions to assure containment and pristine preservation of materials gathered on NASA missions.
For contamination control efforts, understanding contaminants and preventing contamination supports the preservation of sample science integrity and ensures spacecraft function nominally. NASA is seeking analytical and physics-based modeling technologies and techniques to quantify and validate sub-micron particulate contamination, low energy surface material coatings to prevent contamination, and modeling and analysis of particles to ensure hardware and instrumentation meet organic contamination requirements.
",2 to 6,"Prototype, Analysis, Hardware, Software, Research
","Technologies, approaches, techniques, models, and/or prototypes including accompanying data validation reports demonstrating how the product will enable spacecraft compliance with planetary protection and contamination control requirements.
","Planetary protection state-of-the-art leverages the technologies resulting from the 1960s-1970s Viking spacecraft assembly and test era. The predominant means to control biological contamination on spacecraft surfaces is using some combination of heat microbial reduction processing, solvent cleaning (e.g. isopropyl alcohol cleaning). Notably, vapor hydrogen peroxide is a NASA approved process, but the variability of the hydrogen peroxide concentration, delivery mechanism, and material compatibility concerns still tends to be a hurdle to infuse it on a flight mission with complex hardware and multiple materials for a given component. Upon microbial reduction the hardware then is protected in a cleanroom environment (ISO 8 or better) using protective coverings when hardware is not being assembled or tested. Biological cleanliness is then verified through the NASA standard assay which is a culture-based method. Rapid cleanliness assessments can be performed, but are not currently accepted as a verification methodology, to inform engineering staff about biological cleanliness during critical hardware assembly or tests which include the total adenosine triphosphate (tATP) and limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) assays. Terminal sterilization has been conducted with recontamination prevention for in-flight biobarriers employed for the entire spacecraft (Viking) or a spacecraft subsystem (Phoenix spacecraft arm). In addition to the hardware developed approaches for compliance environmental assessments are implemented to understand recontamination potential for cleanroom surfaces and air. While the NASA standard assay is performed on the cleanroom surfaces DNA-based methodologies have been adopted to include 16S and 18S rRNA targeted sequencing while metagenomic approaches are currently undergoing development. Thus, the critical planetary protection gaps include the assessment of DNA from low biomass surfaces (<0.1 ng/uL DNA using current technologies from 1-5m2 of surface), sampling devices that are suitable for low biomass and compounds (e.g. viable organisms, DNA) but also compliant with cleanroom and electrostatic discharge limits, quantification of the widest spectrum of viable organisms, enhanced microbial reduction / sterilization modalities that are compatible with flight materials and a ground- and flight-based recontamination systems.
Contamination Control requirements and practices are also evolving rapidly as mission science objectives targeting detection of organics and life are driving stricter requirements and improved characterization of flight system and science instrument induced contamination. State-of-the-art Contamination Control includes:
Testing and measurement of outgassing rates down to 3.0E-15 g/cm2/s with mass-spectrometry, under flight conditions (low and high operating temperatures) and with combined exposure to natural environment (high-energy radiation, ultraviolet radiation, atomic oxygen exposure) Particulate transport modeling and analysis for continuum, rarefied and molecular flow environments with electrostatic, vibro-acoustic, particle detachment and attachment capabilities. Modeling and analysis of molecular return flux using Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) and the BGK formulation.
","Planetary protection requirements has emerged in recent years with increased interest in investigating bodies with the potential for life detection such as Europa, Enceladus, Mars, etc. and the potential for sample return from such bodies. The development of such technologies would enable missions to be able to be responsive to planetary protection requirements as they would be able to assess viable organisms and establish microbial reduction technologies to achieve acceptable microbial bioburden levels for sensitive life detection instruments to prevent inadvertent “false positives,” to ensure compliance sample return planetary protection and science requirements, and to provide a means to comply with probabilistic based planetary protection requirements for biologically sensitive missions (e.g. outer planets and sample return).

","The NASA State-Of-the-Art (SOA) in space computing utilizes 20-year-old technology and is inadequate for future missions. In conjunction with the United States Air Force (USAF), NASA is investing in the development of the High-Performance Spaceflight Computing (HPSC) Chiplet, a radiation-hardened multi-core processor that will improve space computing capabilities by two orders of magnitude. Another joint NASA-USAF project will develop rad-hard, high capacity, high-speed memory components that will likewise improve space computing capabilities by approximately two orders of magnitude. And yet another project, with a planned start date of FY 2019, will start developing a single board computer based on an HPSC-chiplet.

Additional information on the CLPS program and providers can be found at this link: https://www.nasa.gov/content/commercial-lunar-payload-services. CLPS missions will typically carry multiple payloads for multiple customers. Smaller, simpler, and more self-sufficient payloads are more easily accommodated and would be more likely to be considered for a NASA-sponsored flight opportunity. Commercial payload delivery services may begin as early as 2020 and flight opportunities are expected to continue well into the future. In future years it is expected that larger and more complex payloads will be accommodated. Selection for award under this solicitation will not guarantee selection for a lunar flight opportunity.

"Focus Area 12 Entry, Descent, and Landing Systems",H5.02Hot Structure Technology for Aerospace Vehicles,Hot Structure Technology for Aerospace Vehicles,"This subtopic encompasses the development of reusable hot structure technology for structural components exposed to extreme heating environments on aerospace vehicles. A hot structure system is a multi-functional structure that can reduce or eliminate the need for a separate thermal protection system (TPS) or active cooling system. The potential advantages of using a hot structure system in place of a TPS with underlying cool structure are: reduced mass, increased mission capability, such as reusability, improved aerodynamics, improved structural efficiency and increased ability to inspect the structure. Hot structure is an enabling technology for reusability between missions or mission phases, such as aerocapture followed by entry, and has been used in prior NASA programs (Space Shuttle Orbiter, Hyper-X, and X-37) on control surfaces and wing leading edges, as well as in Department of Defense programs. Additionally, the development of hot structure technology for combustion-device liquid rocket engine propulsion systems is of great interest.
This subtopic seeks to develop innovative low-cost, damage tolerant, reusable and lightweight hot structure technology applicable to aerospace vehicles exposed to extreme temperatures between 1093° to 2204°C (2000° to 4000°F). These aerospace vehicle applications are unique in requiring the hot structure to carry primary structure vehicle loads and to be reusable after exposure to extreme temperatures during atmospheric entry and/or liquid rocket engine firings. The material systems of interest for use in developing hot structure technology include: advanced carbon-carbon (C-C) materials, ceramic matrix composites (CMC’s), or advanced high-temperature refractory metals. Potential applications of hot structure technology include: primary load-carrying aeroshell structures, control surfaces, leading edges, and propulsion system components (such as hot gas valves, combustion chambers, and passively- or actively-cooled nozzle extensions).
Proposals should present approaches to address the current need for improvements in operating temperature capability, toughness/durability, reusability and material system properties. Focus areas should address one or more of the following:
Improvements in manufacturing processes and/or material designs to achieve repeatable and uniform material properties that should be scalable to actual vehicle components: specifically, material property data obtained from flat-panel test coupons should represent the properties of prototype and flight test articles. Material/structural architectures and multifunctional systems providing significant improvements over typical 2D inter-laminar mechanical properties while maintaining in-plane and thermal properties when compared to state-of-the-art C-C or CMC materials.Examples include:incorporating through-the-thickness stitching, braiding or 3D woven preforms. Functionally-graded manufacturing approaches to optimize oxidation protection, damage tolerance and structural efficiency, in an integrated hot structure concept that extends performance for multiple cycles up to 2204°C (4000°F). Manufacturing process methods that enable a significant reduction in the time required to fabricate materials and components.There is a great need to reduce processing time for hot structure materials and components -- current state-of-the-art fabrication times are often in the range of 6 to 12 months, which can limit the use of such materials.Approaches enabling reduced manufacturing times should not, however, lead to significant reductions in material properties.
Under this subtopic, research, testing, and analysis should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards Phase II hardware demonstrations. Phase I feasibility studies should also address cost and risk associated with the hot structures technology. At the completion of the Phase I project, in addition to the final report, deliverables should include at least one of the following to aid assessment of technical feasibility: (a) coupons appropriate for thermal and/or mechanical material property tests, (b) arc-jet test specimens, or (c) a subscale nozzle extension test article or analog component. Emphasis should be placed on the delivery of manufacturing demonstration units for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. In addition, Phase II studies should address scale-up and integration with vehicles that could make use of the developed technology.
Hot structure technology is relevant to the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD), where the technology can be infused into spacecraft and launch vehicle applications. Such technology should provide either improved performance or enable advanced missions requiring re-usability, increased damage tolerance and the durability to withstand long-term space exploration missions. The ability to allow for delivery of larger payloads to various space destinations, such as the lunar south pole, is also of great interest.
The Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) Program would be ideal for further funding a prototype hot structure system and technology demonstration effort. Commercial Space programs, such as Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS), Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS), and Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP), are also interested in this technology for flight vehicles. Additionally, NASA HEOMD programs that could use this technology include the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Human Landing System (HLS) for propulsion applications.
Potential NASA users of this technology exist for a variety of propulsion systems, including the following:
Upper stage engine systems, such as those for the Space Launch System, In-space propulsion systems, including nuclear thermal propulsion systems, Lunar/Mars lander descent/ascent propulsion systems, Solid motor systems, including those for primary propulsion, hot gas valve applications, and small separation and/or attitude-control systems, and Propulsion systems for the Commercial Space industry, which is supporting NASA efforts.
Finally, the U.S. Air Force is interested in such technology for its Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV), ballistic missile and hypersonic vehicle programs. Other non-NASA users include the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Army, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The subject technology can be both enhancing to systems already in use or under development, as well as enabling for applications that may not be feasible without further advancements in high temperature composite technology.
",2 to 4,"Prototypes or components suitable for testing by NASA or Commercial Space partners.
","At the completion of Phase I project deliverables should include at least one of the following: coupons appropriate for thermal/mechanical material property tests, arc-jet test specimens, or a subscale nozzle extension test article. Emphasis should be on the delivery of manufacturing demonstration units, with representative structural features, for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.
","The current state of the art for composite hot structure components is limited primarily to applications with maximum use temperatures in the 1093° – 1600°C (2000° – 2912°F) range. While short excursions to higher temperatures are possible, considerable degradation may occur. Reusability is limited and may require considerable inspection before reuse. Critical gaps or technology needs include: (a) increasing operating temperatures to 1700° – 2204+°C (3092° – 4000+°F); (b) increasing resistance to environmental attack (primarily oxidation); (c) increasing manufacturing technology capabilities to improve reliability, repeatability and quality control; (d) increasing durability/toughness and interlaminar mechanical properties (or introducing 3D architectures); and (e) decreasing overall manufacturing time required.
As an alternative to composites, metallic hot structures may reduce operating temperature requirements to near 1000°C (1832°F) in some applications, while offering greater structural reliability, and should also be pursued. Unfortunately advancements in high temperature metals have been a significant gap.

"Focus Area 12 Entry, Descent, and Landing Systems","Z7.01Entry Descent & Landing Sensors for Environment Characterization, Vehicle Performance, and Guidance, Navigation and Control",,"NASA human and robotic missions to the surface of planetary or airless bodies require Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL). For many of these missions, EDL represents one of the riskiest phases of the mission. Despite the criticality of the EDL phase, NASA has historically gathered limited engineering data from such missions, and use of the data for real-time Guidance, Navigation and Control (GN&C) during EDL for precise landing (aside from Earth) has also been limited. Recent notable exceptions are the Orion EFT-1 flight test, Mars Entry, Descent, & Landing Instrument (MEDLI) sensor suite, and the planned sensor capabilities for Mars 2020 (MEDLI2 and map-relative navigation). NASA requires EDL sensors to: a) understand the in-situ entry environment b) characterize the performance of entry vehicles, and c) make autonomous and real-time onboard GN&C decisions to ensure a precise landing.
This subtopic describes three related technology areas where innovative sensor technologies would enable or enhance future NASA EDL missions. Proposers may submit solutions to any of these scope areas:
1) High Accuracy, Light Weight, Low Power Fiber Optic or Recession Sensing System for Thermal Protection Systems.
2) Miniaturized Spectrometers for Vacuum Ultraviolet & Mid-wave Infrared In-Situ Radiation Measurements during Atmospheric Entry.
3) Novel Sensing Technologies for EDL GN&C and Small-Body Proximity Operations.
NASA seeks innovative sensor technologies to enable and characterize entry, descent and landing operations on missions to planetary and airless bodies. This subtopic describes three related technology areas where innovative sensor technologies would enable or enhance future NASA EDL missions. Candidate solutions are sought that can be made compatible with the environmental conditions of deep spaceflight, and the rigors of landing on planetary bodies both with and without atmospheres. Proposers may submit to scope areas 1, 2 or 3 below.
1) HIGH ACCURACY, LIGHT WEIGHT, LOW POWER FIBER OPTIC OR RECESSION SENSING SYSTEM FOR THERMAL PROTECTION SYSTEMS.
Current NASA state-of-the-art EDL sensing systems are very expensive to design and incorporate on planetary missions. Commercial fiber optic systems offer an alternative that could result in a lower overall cost and weight, while actually increasing the number of measurements. Fiber optic systems are also immune to Electro-magnetic Interference (EMI) which reduces design and qualification efforts. This would be highly beneficial to future planetary missions requiring Thermal Protection Systems (TPS). In addition, as NASA looks to the future of science missions to the Outer Planets, extreme entry environments will require the new, 3-D woven Heatshield for Extreme Entry Environment Technology (HEEET) TPS recently matured within the Agency. Gathering flight performance data on this new material will be key, particularly the measurement of recession, which was so very important on the Galileo probe mission to Jupiter. Minimizing the sensor intrusion of the outer mold line is critical in this case, because the extreme environment dictates that the TPS be as aerothermally monolithic as possible. In applications to planetary entry vehicles greater than about 1 m diameter, however, the HEEET TPS is expected to contain seams that might be used for accommodating instrumentation. Recession measurements in carbon fiber/phenolic TPS systems like Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) and AVCOAT are also of interest. When ablation is not severe and/or rapid, accurate measurements have proven difficult with the historic Galileo-type sensor, which was based on the differential resistance resulting from sensor materials that have charred.
The upcoming Mars 2020 mission will fly the Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing Instrumentation II (MEDLI2) sensor suite consisting of a total of 24 thermocouples, 8 pressure transducers, 2 heat flux sensors, and a radiometer embedded in the TPS. This set of instrumentation will directly inform the large performance uncertainties that contribute to the design and validation of a Mars entry system. A better understanding of the entry environment and TPS performance could lead to reduced design margins enabling a greater payload mass fraction and smaller landing ellipses. Fiber optic sensing systems can offer benefits over traditional sensing system like MEDLI and MEDLI2, and can be used for both rigid and flexible TPS. Fiber optic sensing benefits include, but are not limited to; sensor immunity to EMI, the ability to have thousands of measurements per fiber using Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG), multiple types of measurements per fiber (i.e. temperature, strain, and pressure), and resistance to metallic corrosion.
To be considered against NASA state-of-the-art TPS sensing systems for future flight missions, fiber optic systems must be competitive in sensing capability (measurement type, accuracy, quantity), and Sensor Support Electronics (SSE) mass, size and power. Therefore NASA is looking for a fiber optic system that can meet the following requirements:
Sensing Requirements
TPS Temperature: Measurement Range: -200 to 1250C (up to 2000C preferred), Accuracy: +/- 5C desired. Surface Pressure: Measurement Range: 0-15 psi, Accuracy: < +/-0.5%
Sensor Support Electronics Requirements (including enclosure):
Weight: 12 lbs or less, Size: 240 cubic inches or smaller, Power: 15W or less, Measurement Resolution: 14-bit or Higher, Acquisition Rate per Measurement: 16 Hz or Higher. Compatibility with all sensors types, e.g., Temperature, Pressure, Heat Flux, Strain, Radiometer, TPS recession.
For recession measurements in extreme entry environments requiring 3-D woven TPS, NASA is seeking novel concepts that fit into the sensor/electronics architecture described above, and meet the following requirements:
Up to 5000 W/cm2 heat flux, Up to 5 atmospheres of pressure on the vehicle surface, Recession measurement accuracy within +/- 1 mm.
For recession measurements in moderate entry environments requiring carbon fiber/phenolic TPS systems, NASA is seeking novel concepts that fit into the sensor/electronics architecture described above, and meet the following requirements:
Up to 150-2000 W/cm2 heat flux, Up to 1 atmosphere of pressure on the vehicle surface, Recession measurement accuracy within +/- 1 mm.
2) MINIATURIZED SPECTROMETERS FOR VACUUM ULTRAVIOLET & MID-WAVE INFRARED RADIATION IN-SITU MEASUREMENTS DURING ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY
The current state-of-the-art for flight radiation measurements includes radiometers and spectrometers. Radiometers can measure heating integrated over a wide wavelength range (e.g. MEDLI2 Radiometer), or over narrow-wavelength bands (COMARS+ ICOTOM at 2900 nm and 4500 nm). Spectrometers gather spectrally resolved signal and have been developed for Orion EM-2 (combined Ocean Optics STS units with a range of 190-1100 nm). A spectrometer provides the gold standard for improving predictive models and improving future entry vehicle designs.
For NASA missions through CO2 atmospheres (Venus and Mars), a majority of the radiative heating occurs in the Midwave Infrared range (MWIR: 1500 nm - 6000 nm) [Brandis]. Similarly, for entries to Earth, the radiation is dominated by the Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) range (VUV: 100 - 190 nm) [Cruden]. Both of these ranges are outside of those detectable by available miniaturized spectrometers. While laboratory-scale spectrometers and detectors are available to measure these spectral ranges, there are no versions of these spectrometers which would be suitable for integration into a flight vehicle due to lack of miniaturization. This SBIR calls for miniaturization of VUV and Mid-Wave Infrared (MWIR) spectrometers to extend the current state of the art for flight diagnostics.
Advancements in either VUV or MWIR measurements are sought, preferably for sensors with:
Self-contained with a maximum dimension of ~10 cm or less, No active liquid cooling, Simple interfaces compatible with spacecraft electronics, such as RS232, RS422, or Spacewire, Survival to military spec temperature ranges [-55 to 125C], Power usage of order 5W or less.
3) NOVEL SENSING TECHNOLOGIES FOR EDL GN&C AND SMALL BODY PROXIMITY OPERATIONS
NASA seeks innovative sensor technologies to enhance success for EDL operations on missions to other planetary bodies (including Earth's Moon, Mars, Venus, Titan, and Europa). Sensor technologies are also desired to enhance proximity operations (including sampling and landing) on small bodies such as asteroids and comets.
Sensing technologies are desired that determine any number of the following:
Terrain relative translational state (altimetry/3-axis velocimetry). Spacecraft absolute state in planetary/small-body frame (either attitude, translation, or both). Terrain characterization (e.g., 3D point cloud) for hazard detection, absolute and/or relative state estimation, landing/sampling site selection, and/or body shape characterization. Wind-relative vehicle state and environment during atmospheric entry (e.g., velocity, density, surface pressure, temperature).
Successful candidate sensor technologies can address this call by:
Extending the dynamic range over which such measurements are collected (e.g., providing a single surface topology sensor that works over a large altitude range such as 1m to >10km, and high attitude rates such as greater than 45° /sec). Improving the state-of-the-art in measurement accuracy/precision/resolution for the above sensor needs. * Substantially reducing the amount of external processing needed by the host vehicle to calculate the measurements. Significantly reducing the impact of incorporating such sensors on the spacecraft in terms of Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP), spacecraft accommodation complexity, and/or cost. Providing sensors that are robust to environmental dust/sand/illumination effects. Mitigation technologies for dust/particle contamination of optical surfaces such as sensor optics, with possible extensibility to solar panels and thermal surfaces for Lunar, asteroid, and comet missions. Sensing for wind-relative vehicle velocity, local atmospheric density, and vehicle aerodynamics (e.g. surface pressures and temperatures).
NASA is also looking for high-fidelity real-time simulation and stimulation of passive and active optical sensors for computer vision at update rates greater than 2 Hz to be used for signal injection in terrestrial spacecraft system test beds. These solutions are to be focused on improving system-level performance Verification and Validation during spacecraft assembly and test.
",3 to 5,"Prototype, Analysis, Hardware, Software, Research
","Depending on the type of technology submissions, hardware demonstrations of sensors or applicable support hardware (e.g. EDL sensors), or software simulations/analysis of simulated environments (simulation environments for passive and active optical sensors) are acceptable.
","Active and passive GN&C EDL sensor technologies have been in development over the past decade. Infusion of these capabilities into spaceflight missions requires additional technology advancements to enhance operational performance and dynamic envelop, reduce size, mass, and power, and to address the process of space qualification.
The EDL community has a need to understand the specific contributors to aftbody radiation (especially in CO2 and air); a spectrometer is the next logical step beyond the current state-of-the-art radiometers for EFT-1 and MEDLI2. NASA now requires instrumentation on SMD competed missions involving EDL, and these cost- and mass-constrained missions cannot use the SOA instrumentation. The specific need is for miniaturized spectrometers for in-situ measurements with sensitivity in the VUV or MWIR regions where NASA predicts significant radiation for Earth, Venus, and Mars entries. VUV spectrometers require window operation under vacuum conditions with UV-grade windows for detection of the vacuum ultraviolet. The window materials become increasingly exotic as lower wavelengths are sought. The dispersion of wavelength becomes reduced as spectrometers shrink, which may become an issue for closely spaced features at lower wavelength. Extending the range of miniaturized spectrometers into the MWIR may be limited by the need for extensive cooling and as long wavelengths approach the diffraction limit.
","EDL instrumentation directly informs and addresses the large performance uncertainties that drive the design, validation and in-flight performance of planetary entry systems. Improved understanding of entry environments and TPS performance could lead to reduced design margins enabling a greater payload mass-fraction and smaller landing ellipses. Improved real-time measurement knowledge during entry could also minimize the landing dispersions for placing advanced payloads onto the surface of atmospheric and airless bodies.
NASA Science missions are frequently proposed, that include high-speed Earth return (New Frontiers, Discovery, and Mars Sample Return) and Venus and Mars entry. Capsules used for these missions must withstand both convective and radiative aeroheating, and NASA now requires EDL instrumentation for these missions. Current radiative measurement techniques (radiometers) provide only an integrated heating over limited wavelength range; past interpretation of such flight data [Johnston] show the need for spectrally resolved measurements from spectrometers. For Earth and Venus, the radiative component may be the dominant source of heating, and emission comes from the VUV, that NASA currently has no capability to measure. For Mars and Venus, the aftbody radiation is dominated by MWIR. Again, NASA does not have a method to measure MWIR radiation in flight; the current radiometers integrate across several band systems. Miniaturized spectrometers that can measure in VUV and MWIR would have immediate application to SMD planetary missions. Such spectrometers may also inform what ablation species are emitted from the heatshield and backshell during entry.

Applications include Mars, Venus, Titan, as well as payload return to Earth from Low Earth Orbit. The benefit of deployable decelerators is that the entry vehicle structure and thermal protection system is not constrained by the launch vehicle shroud. It has the flexibility to more efficiently use the available shroud volume, and can be packed into a much smaller volume for Earth departure, addressing potential constraints for payloads sharing a launch vehicle. For Mars, this technology enables delivery of very large (20 metric tons or more) usable payload, which may be needed to support human exploration. The technology also allows for reduced cost access to space by enabling the recovery of launch vehicle assets. This subtopic area solicits innovative technology solutions applicable to deployable entry concepts. Specific technology development areas include:
1) Advancements in textile manufacturing technologies that can be used to simplify production, reduce the mass, or reduce the stowed volume of mechanically deployed structures, inflatable structures, or their flexible thermal protection system. Thermal protection concepts can also lead to improvements in thermal management efficiency of radiant and conductive heat transport at elevated temperatures (exceeding 1200 C). Concepts can be either passive or active dissipation approaches. For smaller scale inflatable systems, less than 1.5 meters in diameter, thin-ply or thin-film manufacturing approaches that can be used to reduce the minimum design gauge are of particular interest for inflatable structures. Focus of Phase 1 development can be subscale manufacturing demonstrations that demonstrate proof of concept and lead to Phase 2 manufacturing scale-up for applications related to Mars entry, Earth return, launch asset recovery, or the emergent small satellite community.
2) Concepts designed to augment the drag or provide guidance control for any class of entry vehicle. Concepts can be either deployable or rigid design systems that are suitable to deployable vehicle designs, including methods that modulate vehicle symmetry or adjust lift for active flight control to improve landing accuracy. Designs that decrease the ballistic coefficient by a factor of two to three times are to be considered. Of particular interest are concepts that can be used to modulate the lift or drag of a vehicle for enhanced control. Phase I proof of concept and preliminary design efforts that will lead to, or can be integrated into, flight demonstration prototypes in a Phase 2 effort are of interest.
3) High temperature capable structural elements to support mechanically deployable decelerators that surpass the performance capability of metallic ribs, joints, and struts. Anticipated systems would include composite elements or hybrid approaches that combine metallic structures with high temperature capable interface materials to improve thermal performance. Phase 1 development can be subscale component demonstrations that lead to Phase 2 scale-up and testing in relevant environments.

Development of efficient guidance control and drag enhancements concepts for deployable vehicles is enabling technology. Novel and innovative high temperature structural concepts are needed for the mechanically deployed decelerator.

"Focus Area 12 Entry, Descent, and Landing Systems",Z7.04Lander Systems Technologies,,"Plume/Surface Interaction Analysis & Ground Testing
As NASA and commercial entities prepare to land robotic and crewed vehicles on the Moon, and eventually Mars, characterization of landing environments is critical to identifying requirements for landing systems and engine configurations, instrument placement and protection, and landing stability. The ability to model and predict the extent to which regolith is transported in the vicinity of the lander is also critical to understanding the effects on precision landing sensor requirements and landed assets located in close proximity. Knowledge of the characteristics, behavior, and trajectories of ejected particles and surface erosion during the landing phase is important for designing descent sensor systems that will be effective. Furthermore, although the physics of the atmosphere, gravitational field, and the characteristics of the regolith are different for the Moon, the tools and analysis capability to characterize plume/surface interactions on the Moon will feed forward to Mars.
Therefore, NASA is seeking support in the following areas:

Currently, flight data are collected from early planetary landing, and those data are fed into developmental tools, for validation purposes. The validation data set, as well as the expertise, grows as a result of each mission, and is shared across and applied to all other missions. We gain an understanding of how various parameters, including different types of surfaces, lead to different cratering effects and plume behaviors. The information helps NASA and industry make lander design and operations decisions. Ground testing (“unit tests”) is used early in the development of the capability, to provide data for tool validation.
The current post-landing analysis of planetary landers (on Mars) is performed in a cursory manner with only partially empirically-validated tools, because there has been no dedicated fundamental research investment in this area. Flight test data does not exist, in the environments of interest.

However, the limited data increase the understanding of various parameters, including the various types of surfaces that lead to different cratering effects and plume behaviors. Additionally, the information influences lander design and operations decisions for future missions. Ground testing (“unit tests”) is also used to provide data for tool validation. Innovative non-intrusive diagnostic development to measure critical parameters in this discipline are also severely lacking and are needed to advance prediction capability. The current post-landing analysis of planetary landers (on Mars) is of limited applicability in reducing risk to future landers, as it is limited to comparisons with only partially empirically-validated tools.

"Focus Area 12 Entry, Descent, and Landing Systems",Z7.053D Weaving Diagnostics,"3D Weaving Diagnostics for Validation of Uniform Weaving Processes
","NASA is utilizing 3D woven materials to develop Woven Thermal Protection Systems (W-TPS). Examples of recent 3D woven Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) projects include: 3D Multifunctional Ablative TPS (3D-MAT) for compression pads on Orion, Adaptive Deployable Entry Placement Technology (ADEPT) looking at a mechanically deployable aeroshell (similar to an umbrella) that utilizes 3D woven carbon fabric between the ribs, and Heatshield for Extreme Entry Environment Technology (HEEET), containing dual-layer 3D weaves to provide mass efficient TPS solutions for extreme entry environment missions such as to Venus, Saturn and the outer planets. The specialized equipment used to weave 3D woven preforms is based on standard textile equipment that is substantially modified to allow hundreds of layers to be interwoven together. As these complex woven structures are scaled up, it is critical to understand the dynamics of the 3D weaving equipment/hardware and how interactions between different components affect the unit cell of the woven structure and ultimately the material properties.
This subtopic area solicits innovative technology solutions applicable to 3-D woven materials. Specific technology development areas include:
Advancements in the understanding of the impact of weaving parameters on the properties of the final weave itself. Looking at developing methods to associate measured weave diagnostics (such as warp tension and beat up force) to understand the effects of woven material parameters (such as fiber volume fraction and yarn crimp), to develop tools to predict the impacts of changes in weaving parameters on final material properties (such as stiffness and strength). Understand what damage may be introduced into the yarns during the weaving operation and the impact of that damage on material performance (such as strength). Objective is to further improve the understanding of how/if key aspects/parameters in the weaving operation (warp tension, beat up force, warp or fill yarns per inch) lead to damage of the yarns and develop methods to reduce weaving damage and/or guidelines to reduce the level of damage induced in the yarns.
",3 to 6,"Prototype, Analysis
","Phase I: Assessment study of potential diagnostic techniques Phase II: Prototype instrument demonstration on a weaving machine demonstrating increased control capability
","NASA is investing in woven thermal protection systems, both rigid and mechanically deployable, which both come from a 3D weave. The mechanical/structural properties of these weaves are a strong function of nuances in the resultant weave microstructure; nuances such as fiber volume fraction and the level of crimp in warp versus weft direction or damage induced in the yarns during weaving. An enhanced understanding of the effects of the weaving operation parameters on the final weave itself would better enable scale-up of weaving processes (thickness and width) and tailoring of weaves to meet specific mission needs (how does a change in warp tension to reduce fiber volume fraction manifest itself in changes to crimp or other parameters). There is also value in understanding if/where the weaving operation induces damage into the yarn and its impact on material properties. The current state of the art is very empirical for understanding the effects of weaving parameters on material performance/damage. For example, it is recognized that increasing crimp can decrease stiffness in a material, but there are not good tools to predict the impacts of changes in weave parameters (such as warp tension) are on the crimp level in a weave and how that will impact the properties of the final material. This makes it difficult to predict the impacts of changes in weave on properties and understand how sensitive the relationships are. The end result is that this lack of knowledge limits the flexibility end users have, and requires substantial amounts of testing to understand if a given change is important or not.

With few exceptions, entry vehicle TPS (Thermal Protection System) for these missions will be composed of materials currently under development and without certification heritage.

"Focus Area 12 Entry, Descent, and Landing Systems",Z7.06Diagnostic tools for high enthalpy and high temperature materials testing and analysis,"Optical imaging diagnostics for validation of conventional instrumentation and simulation used to characterize high enthalpy, arc-heated ground test facilities","Advances and new technologies are sought for optical-spectroscopic imaging techniques for NASA’s high enthalpy aeroheating test facilities, specifically the Ames Research Center’s Arc Jet Complex and Langley Research Center’s Hypersonic Materials Environmental Test System (HyMETS). These facilities are used for evaluation of entry system thermal protection materials and structures. Experimental methods for arc jet facility characterization strive to quantify thermodynamic and gas dynamic properties of arc jet flows and serve multiple purposes, such as verification of test conditions (facility operations), validation of arc heater and flow field simulations, and measurement of incident/boundary conditions for material response simulations.
Foremost among these methods are instrumented stream probes and shaped test articles. They are routinely used to measure local heat flux and surface pressure and are tightly integrated with facility operations. Concerns over systematic errors in heat flux measurements have, to date, not been adequately addressed due to a lack of relevant data for validation of the underlying metrology principle – namely the interpreted response of a heat flux sensor to a nominally stable, but unsteady and highly dissociated, gas stream. Development of specialized diagnostic tools which can acquire these validation data, in situ, is the goal of this subtopic scope.
",3 to 6,"Prototype, Hardware
","Phase I: Assessment study of potential diagnostic techniques Phase II: Prototype instrument demonstration in relevant environment with hardware delivery to NASA
","Heat flux is undoubtedly the most critical measurement of every arc jet test program as it is used for facility operations, flow field simulation validation, and materials response analyses. Diminished – or unwarranted – confidence in conventional heat flux gauge measurements influences uncertainty in test results and ultimately adds risk to TPS (Thermal Protection System) qualification programs.
In highly dissociated arc jet flows, convective, catalytic, and radiative heat fluxes simultaneously contribute to a heat flux gauge’s response. However, response interpretation may not properly account for the microscopic thermodynamic and spatiotemporal characteristics of the incident stream and gas-surface interactions that ultimately govern the response. Potential sources of error and bias are incident flow property unsteadiness and catalytic efficiency uncertainties.
Perturbations and instabilities within the arc heater can persist through nonequilibrium expansion within the nozzle and into the test chamber, possibly resulting in fluctuating flow properties, gradients, and atom fluxes at article surfaces. As flow property gradients are the driving potentials for catalysis, property fluctuations could influence the magnitude of catalytic heat flux. Departures from modeled interpretation cannot be discerned without direct observation, potentially resulting in unknown error and bias in heat flux measurements.
Also contributing to error and bias is the uncertainty in the sensor’s catalytic efficiency. A reduction or augmentation from an assumed value creates an undetectable bias in heat flux measurements with consequences that may not be conservative. Coupled with the potential influence of property gradient fluctuations on catalysis, the modeling assumptions of heat transfer to catalytic surfaces in dissociated flows cannot be validated without additional, independent data sources.
Time-resolved gas property measurement along the stagnation streamline would enable evaluation of the key assumptions of NASA’s heat flux measurement approach. Quantities of particular interest are atomic and molecular species concentrations and temperature. The profiles and statistical variations could verify the conformance to, or reveal the departure from, the modeled theories. The ultimate benefit will be greater confidence in NASA’s use of heat flux gauges.
The above requirements strongly indicate the use of kHz rate, species-selective, ultrafast pulsed laser spectroscopic imaging techniques to advance the state-of-the art. NASA’s current nanosecond laser-induced fluorescence capabilities are inadequate due to insufficient sensitivity for quantitative planar imaging in the highly luminous shock layer ahead of a test model.
","Several potential future missions, outlined in decadal surveys, crewed exploration mission studies, and other supporting analyses, have Entry and Descent (ED)/ Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) architectures: Mars sample return, high speed crewed return, high mass Mars landers, Venus and gas/ice giant probes. With few exceptions, entry vehicle TPS for these missions will be composed of materials currently under development and without certification heritage. Arc jet testing at conditions relevant for certification will invariably be required for each of these proposed missions. Ground testing at more extreme environments for future missions will challenge existing capabilities. There is a compelling need now to bring research-level diagnostic technologies forward to ensure that facility operations can credibly demonstrate required performance to TPS technology projects.
Conventional instrumentation will continue to be the primary source of facility characterization data. The purposes of the advanced techniques are to provide validating evidence for the conventional instrumentation, reveal error and bias in interpretation of heat flux measurements, and ultimately reduce uncertainty in facility performance data provided to test programs.
NASA planetary exploration programs supporting ED/EDL missions are the intended beneficiaries of this subtopic. The first-line project is STMD’s (Space Technology Mission Directorate) Entry Systems Modeling Project.

"Focus Area 12 Entry, Descent, and Landing Systems",Z7.06Diagnostic tools for high enthalpy and high temperature materials testing and analysis,Advanced instrumentation for NASA's shock tube and ballistic range facilities,"NASA is seeking innovative imaging and spectroscopic measurement techniques for NASA’s two specialized-use impulse facilities: the Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST) and the Hypervelocity Free Flight Aerodynamic Facility (HFFAF). The EAST facility replicates shocked gas environments encountered by entry vehicles transiting planetary atmospheres at hypersonic velocities. Spectroscopic instrumentation is used to characterize the absolute radiance and gas kinetics behind a traveling shock wave. The HFFAF is used for the study of dynamically similar supersonic and hypersonic aerodynamics, transition to turbulence, and laminar and turbulent convective heat transfer. Optical imaging instrumentation is used to characterize aerodynamic forces and moments of scaled models launched through the range. Thermographic and spectral imaging instrumentation is used to characterize spatially resolved heating rates to scaled models.
New electro-optic products and methods enable measurement of quantities beyond current capabilities and improve current practices.
",3 to 6,"Prototype, Hardware
","Phase I: Assessment study of potential diagnostic techniques or technology upgrades Phase II: Prototype instrument demonstration in relevant environment (preferably w/hardware delivery to NASA)
","The EAST facility’s instrumentation acquires data for shocked gas phenomenology and facility performance characterization. Measurements of radiance, absorbance, electron density, and temperature are used for validation of comprehensive radiation transport simulations of planetary atmospheres. Those measurements are primarily acquired using calibrated optical-spectroscopic instruments with sufficient temporal and/or spatial resolution to correlate observed magnitudes with localized, spectrally resolved absolute radiant fluxes or columnar property densities (including electron densities). Ancillary instrumentation is used to measure shock arrival times and transient pressures at the tube wall to establish shock speeds adjacent to the science instruments.
Measurement techniques that correlate observables to atomic and molecular state populations and radiance magnitudes enable validation of radiance models. Emission spectroscopy techniques, which capture the transient characteristics of excited atomic and molecular state populations, have reached a high degree of maturity and efficacy.
However, post-shock electron and ground or other dark state population dynamics also influence shock radiance. Measurement of these states rely on more complicated absorption, induced fluorescence, or scattering (spontaneous and coherent) techniques. The lack of light sources and/or detectors with suitable spectral and temporal characteristics or the challenges of implementation in impulse facilities have limited opportunities for such measurements. Techniques that enable measurement of these states would greatly expand opportunities for radiation transport model validation, particularly for conditions in which self-absorption would influence emission spectroscopy measurements.
For the HFFAF, shadowgraph and schlieren photography are used to provide time-resolved imagery for aerodynamic force and moment analyses of scaled flight vehicles in free flight. A high-speed shutter (40 ns duration) and a spark-gap light source enable images to be captured without motion blur. The shuttering system relies on Kerr cells filled with benzonitrile and a 35 kV pulse shaping and switching network. Advances are sought for the eventual replacement of the 32 heritage light source/shutter systems with components that offer equal or greater performance as well as improved safety and reliability.
","Several potential future missions, outlined in decadal surveys, crewed exploration mission studies, and other supporting analyses, have ED/EDL architectures: Mars sample return, high speed crewed return, high mass Mars landers, Venus and gas/ice giant probes. Entry vehicles to these destinations will encounter radiative heating to varying degrees. Radiative heating of a vehicle’s back shell has been recognized as a significant concern, so ensuring a full range of diagnostic techniques for expanding flows has become a high priority for the EDL (Entry, Descent, and Landing) community.
Characterizing the aerodynamic stability of emerging deployable drag devices for entry vehicles is also of high importance for future high-mass lander missions. The HFFAF will be a key ground test facility for acquiring crucial free-flight aerodynamic data for study and simulation validation.
NASA planetary exploration programs supporting ED/EDL missions are the intended beneficiaries of this subtopic. Technology development projects supporting these programs are potential beneficiaries of new instrumentation for the EAST and HFFAF.

Focus Area 13 Information Technologies for Science Data,S5.01Technologies for Large-Scale Numerical Simulation,Exascale Computing,"NASA scientists and engineers are increasingly turning to large-scale numerical simulation on supercomputers to advance understanding of complex Earth and astrophysical systems, and to conduct high-fidelity aerospace engineering analyses. The goal of this subtopic is to increase the mission impact of NASA's investments in supercomputing systems and associated operations and services. Specific objectives are to:
Decrease the barriers to entry for prospective supercomputing users Minimize the supercomputer user's total time-to-solution (e.g., time to discover, understand, predict, or design) Increase the achievable scale and complexity of computational analysis, data ingest, and data communications Reduce the cost of providing a given level of supercomputing performance for NASA applications Enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of NASA's supercomputing operations and services
The approach of this subtopic is to seek novel software and hardware technologies that provide notable benefits to NASA's supercomputing users and facilities, and to infuse these technologies into NASA supercomputing operations. Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, NASA's High-End Computing (HEC) projects - the High End Computing Capability project at Ames and the Scientific Computing project at Goddard. To assure maximum relevance to NASA, funded SBIR contracts under this subtopic should engage in direct interactions with one or both HEC projects, and with key HEC users where appropriate. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and NASA relevance during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration.
Offerors should demonstrate awareness of the state-of-the-art of their proposed technology, and should leverage existing commercial capabilities and research efforts where appropriate. Open source software and open standards are strongly preferred. Note that the NASA supercomputing environment is characterized by:
HEC systems operating behind a firewall to meet strict IT security requirements Communication-intensive applications Massive computations requiring high concurrency Complex computational workflows and immense datasets The need to support hundreds of complex application codes - many of which are frequently updated by the user/developer.
Projects need not benefit all NASA HEC users or application codes, but demonstrating applicability to an important NASA discipline, or even a key NASA application code, could provide significant value. For instance, a GPU accelerated (or multi-core) planetary accretion code such as LIPAD (Lagrangian Integrator for Planetary Accretion and Dynamics) could be one possible project.
The three main technology areas of S5.01 are aligned with three objectives of the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) announced by the White House in July 2015. The overarching goal of NSCI is to coordinate and accelerate U.S. activities in HEC, including hardware, software, and workforce development, so that the U.S. remains the world leader in HEC technology and application. NSCI charges every agency that is a significant user of HEC to make a significant contribution to this goal. This SBIR subtopic is an important part of NASA's contribution to NSCI. See https://www.nitrd.gov/nsci/index.aspx(link is external) for more information about NSCI. The three main elements of S5.01 are:
Many NASA science applications demand much faster supercomputers. This area seeks technologies to accelerate the development of an efficient and practical exascale computing system (1018 operations per second). Innovative file systems that leverage node memory and a new exascale operating system geared toward NASA applications are two possible technologies for this element. At the same time, this area calls for technology to support co-design (i.e., concurrent design) of NASA applications and exascale supercomputers, enabling application scaling to billion-fold parallelism while dramatically increasing memory access efficiency. This supports NSCI Objective 1. (Accelerating delivery of a capable exascale computing system that integrates hardware and software capability to deliver approximately 100 times the performance of current 10 petaflop systems across a range of applications representing government needs.) Data analytics is becoming a bigger part of the supercomputing workload, as computed and measured data expand dramatically, and the need grows to rapidly utilize and understand that data. This area calls for technologies that support convergence of computing systems optimized for modeling & simulation and those optimized for data analytics (e.g., data assimilation, data compression, image analysis, machine learning, visualization, and data mining). In situ data analytics that can run in-memory side-by-side with the model run is another possible technology for this element. This supports NSCI Objective 2. (Increasing coherence between the technology base used for modeling and simulation and that used for data analytic computing.) Presently it is difficult to integrate cyberinfrastructure elements (supercomputing system, data stores, distributed teams, instruments, mobile devices, etc.) into an efficient and productive science environment. This area seeks technologies to make elements of the supercomputing ecosystem much more accessible and composable, while maintaining security. This supports NSCI Objective 4. (Increasing the capacity and capability of an enduring national HPC ecosystem by employing a holistic approach that addresses relevant factors such as networking technology, workflow, downward scaling, foundational algorithms and software, accessibility, and workforce development.)
",5 to 7,Prototype Software,,"The SOA and the critical gaps of the three technologies areas are: 1. NASA science requires at least 100X more powerful supercomputers and 1000X higher application parallelism in 10 years, at the same power. 2. Current technologies for high-fidelity computational simulations and data analytics are distinct, and interfacing them is inefficient. 3.

Focus Area 13 Information Technologies for Science Data,S5.03Accelerating NASA Science and Engineering through the Application of Artificial Intelligence,Accelerating NASA Science and Engineering through the Application of Artificial Intelligence,"NASA researchers are increasingly using Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies across science and engineering to address questions that previously could not be studied, in order to open up new insights. While many problems can be addressed with AI, the adoption of these techniques and technologies has been slow due to the large learning curve associated with the application of these technologies, the applicability of commercial tools to specific problems of interest for NASA, and the high level of effort to create training sets. The goal of this subtopic is to overcome these challenges and accelerate NASA science and engineering through the development and/or application of tools and technologies that use AI, including Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and more. The expected outcomes of this subtopic are tools and technologies that use AI that lead to improved science and engineering, and that lead to advancements in operational capabilities for remote sensing instruments and platforms.
The specific objectives of this subtopic include the following. Innovative proposals using AI are being sought to solve these unique problems across NASA science. Proposals MUST be in alignment with existing and/or future NASA programs and address or extend a specific need or question for those programs. Examples of AI solutions to NASA problems include:
Mission Operations with long latency communications in deep space environments where the models of the destinations are not well known. Examples of these missions include rovers/instruments on Mars2020 and the Europa Lander. Advanced autonomy with the ability for instruments to learn at the edge Fault detection and recovery Anomaly detection for instruments or platforms Onboard/embedded machine learning for remote sensing platforms Data fusion and predictions across multiple data sets using AI, examples include Enhanced geoeffective space-weather predictions Creation of a global product from the fusion of multiple satellite inputs for areas such as carbon science or aerosols Downscaling lower-resolution images to higher resolutions, either from previous missions or through combination of multiple data sets and in-situ data Augmenting automatic image analysis, including registration, classification, segmentation, and/or change detection. Examples include Identification of spatial patterns to better determine calibration factors across multiple instruments or for detecting instrument degradation The detection of transient events in astronomical imagery The detection of burned areas from Earth imagery
Research proposed to this subtopic should demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I, and in partnership with scientists and/or engineers, show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration, with significant communication with missions and programs to later plan a potential Phase III infusion. It is highly desirable that the proposed projects lead to solutions that will be infused into NASA programs and projects.
Tools and products developed under this subtopic may be developed for broad public dissemination or used within a narrow community. These tools can be plug-ins or enhancements to existing software, on-line data/computing services, or new stand-alone applications or web services, provided that they promote interoperability and use standard protocols, file formats, and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

Define, design, develop, and execute future science missions by developing and utilizing advanced methods and tools that empower more comprehensive, broader, and deeper system and subsystem modeling, while enabling these models to be developed earlier in the lifecycle. Ideally, the proposed solutions should leverage MBSE (Model-Based Systems Engineering)/SysML (System Markup Language) approaches being piloted across NASA, allow for easier integration of disparate model types, and be compatible with current agile design processes. Enable disciplined system analysis for the design of future missions, including modeling of decision support for those missions and integrated models of technical and programmatic aspects of future missions. Evaluate technology alternatives and impacts, science valuation methods, and programmatic and/or architectural trades.
Specific areas of interest are listed below. Proposers are encouraged to address more than one of these areas with an approach that emphasizes integration with others on the list:
Conceptual phase models and tools that allow design teams to easily develop, populate, and visualize very broad, multidimensional trade spaces; methods for characterizing and selecting optimum candidates from those trade spaces, particularly at the architectural level. There is specific interest in models and tools that facilitate comprehensive comparison of architectural variants of systems. Capabilities for rapid generation models of function or behavior of complex systems, at either the system or the subsystem level. Such models should be capable of eliciting robust estimates of system performance given appropriate environments and activity timelines, and should be tailored:To support emerging usage of autonomy, both in mission operations and flight software as well as in growing usage of auto-coding. To operate within highly distributed, collaborative design environments, where models and/or infrastructure that support/encourage designers are geographically separated (including Open Innovation environments). This includes considerations associated with near-real-time (concurrent) collaboration processes and associated model integration and configuration management practices. To be capable of execution at variable levels of fidelity/uncertainty. Ideally, models should have the ability to quickly adjust fidelity to match the requirements of the simulation (e.g., from broad-and-shallow to in-depth and back again).Target models (e.g., phenomenological or geophysical models) that represent planetary surfaces, interiors, atmospheres, etc., and associated tools and methods that allow for integration into system design/process models for simulation of instrument responses. These models may be algorithmic or numeric, but should be useful to designers wishing to optimize remote sensing systems for those planets.
Note that this topic area addresses a broad potential range of science mission-oriented modeling tools and methods. This includes the integration of these tools into broader model-based engineering frameworks, and also includes proposals with MBSE/SysML as the primary focus.
",3 to 5,"Prototype, Software
","At the completion of Phase 2, NASA desires a working prototype suitable for demonstrations with ""real"" data to make a compelling case for NASA usage. Use and development of the model - including any and all work performed to verify and validate it - should be documented.
","There currently are a variety of models, methods, and tools in use across the Agency and with our industry partners. These are often custom, phase-dependent, and poorly interfaced to other tools. The disparity between the creativity in the early phases and the detail-oriented focus in later phases has created phase transition boundaries, where missions not only change teams but tools and methods as well. We aim to improve this.
As NASA continues its move into greater use of models for formulation and development of NASA projects and programs, there are recurring challenges to address. This sub-topic focuses on encouraging solutions to these cross-cutting modeling challenges. These cross-cutting challenges include: greater modeling breadth (e.g., cost/schedule), depth (scalability), variable fidelity (precision/accuracy vs computation time), trade space exploration (how to evaluate large numbers of options), and processes that link them together. The focus is not on specific tools, but demonstrations of capability and methodologies for achieving the above.
The explosion of MBX (Model Based Everything) has led to a proliferation of models, modeling processes, and the integration/aggregation thereof. The model results are often combined with no clear understanding of the fidelity/credibility. While some NASA folks are looking for greater accuracy and ""single source of truth,"" others are looking for the generation and exploration of massive trade spaces. Both greater precision and greater robustness will require addressing the cross-cutting challenges cited above.
","Several concept/feasibility studies for potential large (flagship) Astrophysics missions are in progress: LUVOIR, OST, HabEx and Lynx. Following the 2020 Astrophysics decadal rankings, one of these will likely proceed to early Phase A where the infusion of new and advanced systems modeling tools and methods would be a potential game-changer in terms of rapidly navigating architecture trades, requirements development and flow-down, and design optimization.
A variety of planetary missions requires significant modeling and simulation across a variety of possible trade spaces. The portions of this topic area focused on breadth and variable fidelity will support them..

","Space weather has the potential to disrupt telecommunications, aircraft and satellite systems, electric power subsystems, and position, navigation, and timing services. Given the importance of these systems to our national well-being, NASA’s Heliophysics Division invests in activities to improve the understanding of these phenomena and to enable new monitoring, prediction, and mitigation strategies.
The national direction for this work is organized by the Space Weather Operations, Research, and Mitigation (SWORM) Working Group, which is a Federal interagency coordinating body organized under the Space Weather, Security, and Hazards (SWSH) Subcommittee. The SWSH is a part of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Committee on Homeland and National Security, organized under the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). The SWORM coordinates Federal Government departments and agencies to meet the goals and objectives specified in the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan released in March 2019.
NASA’s role under the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan is to provide increased understanding of the fundamental physics of the Sun-Earth system through space-based observations and modeling, the development of new space-based space weather technologies and missions, and monitoring of space weather for NASA's space missions. This includes research that advances operational space weather needs.
This subtopic solicits new, enabling space weather technologies as part of NASA’s response to these national objectives. While this subtopic will consider all concepts demonstrably related to NASA’s Research-to-Operations/Operations-to-Research (R2O/O2R) responsibilities outlined in the Strategy and Action Plan, five areas have been identified for priority development:
(1) Space Weather Forecasting Technologies and Techniques: Innovative technologies and techniques are solicited that explore and enable the transition of tools, models, data, and knowledge from research to operational environments. This includes the preparation and validation of existing science models that may be suitable for transition to operational use. Coordination with existing NASA capabilities, such as the Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG) at Johnson Space Center (JSC), the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) at GSFC, and the Short-term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) Center at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), is appropriate. Areas of special interest include, but are not limited to:
Lunar space environment characterization tools that can be employed by NASA to enhance protection of crewed and uncrewed missions to cis-lunar and lunar surface missions; Specifications and/or forecasts of the energetic particle and plasma conditions encountered by spacecraft within Earth’s magnetosphere, as well as products that directly aid in spacecraft anomaly resolution, and end-users such as spacecraft operators; Approaches that potentially lead to a 2-3 days forecasting of atmospheric drag effects on satellites and improvement in the quantification of orbital uncertainties in LEO altitude ranges (up to ~2000 km); Techniques that enable the characterization and prediction of ionospheric variability that induces scintillations, which impact communication and global navigation and positioning systems; Longer-range (2-3 days) forecasting of SPEs (Solar Particle Events) and an improved all-clear SPE forecasting capability.
(2) Space Weather Advanced Data-Driven Discovery Techniques: A particular challenge is to combine the sparse, vastly distributed data sources available with realistic models of the near-Earth space environment. Data assimilation and other cutting-edge data-driven discovery innovations are solicited that enable tools and protocols for the operational space weather community. Priority will be given to proposals that:
Develop data assimilation space weather applications or technologies desired by established space weather operational organizations; Integrate data from assets that typically do not share similar time series, utilize different measurement techniques (e.g., imaging vs in-situ particles and fields), or are distributed throughout the heliosphere; Provide new data driven operational forecasting tools that can be straightforwardly validated by the CCMC or another equally robust validation methodology; and/or, Integrate underutilized resources (e.g. space-based radio occultation for ionospheric specification or U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) ground conductivity measurements related to geomagnetically induced currents).
(3) Space Weather Benchmarks: The Heliophysics System Observatory (HSO) data archives include a vast array of spacecraft observations suitable for the development of space weather benchmarks, which are the set of characteristics against which space weather events are measured. This includes refining the Phase 1 Benchmarks that were released by the National Science and Technology Council in 2018 for induced geo-electric fields, ionizing radiation, ionospheric disturbance, solar radio bursts, and upper atmospheric expansion. These benchmarks should be in a form useful to the owners and operators of systems and assets that contribute to critical national functions. Innovations to produce and/or further refine these benchmarks are solicited, as are concepts for future creative approaches utilizing new data types or models that could become available.
(4) Space Weather Mitigation Technologies: The 2019 National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan specifically calls out the need to test, evaluate, and deploy technologies and devices to mitigate the effects of space weather on communication systems, geomagnetic disturbances on the electrical power grid, or radiation events on satellites. It also includes the development of processes to improve the transition of research approaches to operations.
(5) Space Weather Instrumentation: Heliophysics science relies on a wide variety of instrumentation for its research and often makes its data available in near-real-time for space weather forecasting purposes. Concepts are solicited for instrumentation concepts, flight architectures, and reporting systems that enable enhanced, more informative, robust, and effective measurements for space weather monitoring and forecasting systems. Opportunities for improving measurements include increased spatial and temporal resolution, fidelity, promptness, and measurement system reliability. This includes the miniaturization of existing systems and/or technologies deployable as an array of CubeSats. In order to be considered for investment, SBIR technologies should demonstrate comparable, or better, precision and accuracy when compared to the current state-of-the art. Further, SBIR instrument designs should avoid duplicating current NASA research spacecraft arrays or detector systems including those currently in formulation or development (e.g. Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP), Geospace Dynamics Constellation (GDC), Medici, Explorer concepts, etc.).
Proposals must demonstrate an understanding of the current state-of-the-art, describe how the proposed innovation is superior, and provide a feasible plan to develop the technology and infuse into a specific activity listed within the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan.

","Space weather is a broad umbrella encompassing science, engineering, applications and operations. The ultimate goal of this SBIR is to generate products or services (“deliverables”) that enable end-user action. The deliverables can be applied, for example, to space weather hazard assessments, real-time situational awareness, or to plan protective mitigation actions. Deliverables can be in the form of new data, new techniques new instrumentation, or predictive models that are prepared/validated for transition into operations.
","We do not yet know how to predict what needs to be predicted; we do not yet know how quantitatively good/bad our operational capabilities are (metrics); mechanisms do not yet exist to enable a broad range of the community to participate in the improvement of operational models; the research environment advances understanding rather than the improvement of operational products.
Space weather poses a constant threat to the Nation’s critical infrastructure, our satellites in orbit, and our crewed and uncrewed space activities. Extreme space weather events can cause substantial harm to our Nation’s security and economic vitality. Preparing for space weather events is an important aspect of American resilience that bolsters national and homeland security and facilitates continued U.S. leadership in space A robust space weather program and its associated forecasting capabilities are essential for NASA’s future exploration success.
","This SBIR subtopic enables NASA to demonstrate progress against NASA Goal 1.4: Understand the Sun and its interactions with Earth and the solar system, including space weather.
These applied research projects directly address NASA's role within the Space Weather Operations, Research, and Mitigation (SWORM) Working Group, which is a Federal interagency coordinating body organized under the Space Weather, Security, and Hazards (SWSH) Subcommittee. The SWSH is a part of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Committee on Homeland and National Security, organized under the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). The SWORM coordinates Federal Government departments and agencies to meet the goals and objectives specified in the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan released in March 2019.
The Heliophysics Space Weather Science and Applications (SWxSA) Program establishes an expanded role for NASA in space weather science under single element. It is consistent with the recommendation of the NRC Decadal Survey and the OSTP/SWORM 2019 National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan. It competes ideas and products, leverages existing agency capabilities, collaborates with other agencies, and fosters partnership with user communities. The SWxSA program is distinguishable from other heliophysics research elements in that it is specifically focused on investigations that significantly advance understanding of space weather and then apply this progress to enable more accurate characterization and predictions with longer lead time. The Heliophysics Living with a Star (LWS) Program has established a path forward to meet the NASA’s obligations to the research relevant to space weather and is a significant source of input to SWxSA.
Further involvement by the emerging Heliophysics space weather commercial community has the potential to significantly advance the space weather application obligations portion of the mandate.
Astronauts are not protected by the Earth's atmosphere and are exposed to space radiation such as galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles. A robust space weather program and associated forecasting capabilities is essential for NASA's future exploration success.

"Focus Area 14 On-orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (OSAM)",T12.06Extensible Modeling of Additive Manufacturing Processes,"Process Modeling of Additive Manufacturing
","The subtopic of modeling of additive processes is highly relevant to NASA as NASA is currently on a path to implement additive processes in space flight systems with little or no ability to model the process and thereby predict the results. In order to reliably use this process with a variety of materials for space flight applications, NASA has to have a much deeper understanding of the process. NASA is currently considering these processes for the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE), Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals (SHERLOC), ion engines and other spacecraft structural and multi-functional applications. Additive manufacturing of development and flight hardware with metallic alloys is being developed by NASA and its various partners for a variety of spacecraft applications. These components are expected to see extreme environments coupled with a need for high-reliability (e.g., manned spaceflight), which requires a deeper understanding of the manufacturing processes. Modeling of the additive processes to provide accurate dimensional designs, preferred micro-structures that are defect-free is a significant challenge that would dramatically benefit from a joint academic-industry approach. The objective would be to create process models that are compatible with current alloys systems and additive manufacturing equipment which will provide accurate prediction of outcomes from a variety of additive manufacturing process parameters and materials combinations. The primary alloys of interest to NASA at this time include: Inconel 625 & 718, stainless steels, such as 304 and 316, Al10SiMg, Ti-6Al-4V, and copper alloys (GrCop-84). It is desired that the modeling approach address a focused material system, but be readily adaptable to eventually accommodate all of these materials. Therefore, the model should incorporate modest parameter changes coupled with being easily extensible for future alloys of interest to NASA. NASA is interested in modeling of the Selective Laser Melting (SLM), Electron Beam Melting (EBM) and Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) processes.
","Proposed technologies should mature to TRL 1 to 2 by the end of Phase II effort.
","Software
","A functional process model covering the specific area by the proposer, using open source or code shared with the Agency.
","Additive manufacturing will be used for space flight applications. NASA, and its suppliers, currently have very little knowledge of what is happening with these processes. Modeling of these additive processes is essential for NASA to be able to use these processes reliably. NASA is currently working on a specification for these processes and modeling would help that effort as well.
","Process modeling of additive manufacturing is relevant to Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD), Science Mission Directorate (SMD)), and Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), all of which have extant efforts in additive manufacturing. HEOMD is focusing heavily on the use of additive manufacturing for propulsion systems (e.g. RS-25, RL10) for SLS, SMD is using additive manufacturing on the Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry (PIXL) on the Mars 2020 mission, the Psyche Mission, as well as various ESI initiatives through STMD.","Stranza, M. et al., Materials Letters, accepted (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2018.07.141(link is external))

OSAM is an emerging national initiative to transform the way we design, build, and operate in space. The goal of the initiative is to develop a strategic framework to enable robotic servicing, repair, assembly, manufacturing, and inspection of space assets.
An in-space material joining capability is an important supporting technology for the long duration, long endurance space missions that NASA will undertake beyond the International Space Station (ISS). Historically structures in space have been assembled using mechanical fastening techniques and modular assembly. Structural designs for crewed habitats, space telescopes, antennas, and solar array reflectors are primarily driven by launch considerations such as payload faring dimensions and vibrational loads experienced during ascent. An in-space material joining capability can potentially eliminate constraints on the system imposed by launch, enabling the construction of larger, more complex and more optimized structures. Material joining is an essential complementary capability to large scale additive manufacturing technologies being developed by NASA and commercial partners. Material joining is also a critical capability for repair scenarios (ex. repair of damage to a structure from micrometeorite impacts).
This subtopic seeks innovative engineering solutions to robotically join materials, fully or semi-autonomous, for manufacturing in the external space environment. Current State-Of-the-Art (SOA) terrestrial joining methods such and laser beam, electron beam, brazing, friction/ultrasonic stir and arc welding should be modified with an effort to reduce the footprint, mass and power requirements for on-orbit applications.
Phase I is a feasibility study and laboratory proof of concept of a robotic welding process and system for external in-space manufacturing applications. Targeted applications for this technology include joining and repair of components at the subsystem level, habitat modules, trusses, solar arrays, and/or antenna reflectors. The need to repair a damaged structure may require the need to not only join material but cut and remove material. A single process with the ability to not only join material but also cut/remove material is a priority. The Phase I effort should provide a laboratory demonstration of the joining process and its applicability to aerospace grade metallic materials and/or thermoplastics, focusing on joint configurations which represent the priority in-space joining applications identified above. Work under Phase I will inform preliminary design of a mobile welding unit and a concept of operations for how the system would be deployed and operate in the space environment, with a focus on specific scenarios: for example, repair of a metal panel following micrometeorite damage, longitudinal joining of two metal curved panels, and joining of a truss to an adjacent truss. The Phase I should also provide an assessment of the proposed process operational capabilities (for example: classes of materials which can be welded with the process, joint configurations which can be accommodated, and any expected impacts of the microgravity environment on joint efficiency relative to terrestrial system operation), volume, and power budget. A preliminary design and concept of operations are also deliverables under the phase I. Concepts for ancillary technologies such as post-process inspection, in-situ monitoring, or robotic arms for manipulation of structures to be joined may also be included in the Phase I effort.
Phase I requires a demonstration/proof of concept that: a) the process selected enables high-value applications of in-space welding for repair and assembly and b) system shows potential for being operated remotely with very little intervention/setup. Phase II includes finalization of the design and demonstration of a ground-based prototype system. Phase III would seek to evolve the technology toward a flight demonstration, either via a system mounted externally on ISS, Gateway, Restore-L or as a free-flyer.

","External in-space manufacturing has primarily focused on fabrication of structures in the space environment. Material joining is an essential supporting technology to these capabilities. Research on joining tapered off to some extent following the cancellation of the In-Space Welding Experiment (ISWE) for space shuttle. With the emergence of the OSAM initiative, a renewed interest and focus on manufacturing structures in the space environment as an enhancing capability for long duration missions and as a way to remove design constraints imposed by payload fairings and launch loads, additional work on development of an in-space material joining capability should be a priority. In-space joining represents an essential complementary technology to in-space fabrication techniques.

"Focus Area 14 On-orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (OSAM)",Z3.04Autonomous Modular Assembly Technology for OSAM,"Autonomous Modular Assembly Technology for On-Orbit Servicing, Assembly and Manufacturing (OSAM)","As NASA seeks to extend its presence into deep space, ground-based human intelligence applied to supervision, control, and intervention of operations will no longer be viable due to system and mission complexity and communication delays. Therefore, trusted and certified-safe autonomous systems with machine intelligence and robotic capabilities of responding to both nominal and unexpected situations will be needed. These systems should be capable of:
Sensing and perception Acquiring measurements on-orbit or on planetary surfaces Achieving situational awareness Making decisions Taking action Teaming with humans and other machine agents Using experiential data to update capabilities Verifying autonomy algorithms and behavior Validating as-assembled structure shape and interface integrity
As such, autonomy, system modularity, metrology, and modeling & simulation are four critical aspects required to enable On-Orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (OSAM). The hardware and software components of an in-space assembled structure must be modular to facilitate servicing, component replacement, and reconfiguration of the spacecraft. Assembly by autonomous robots can reduce the workload on astronauts and ground crew as well as mitigate inefficiencies due to communication delays associated with teleoperation. The OSAM paradigm requires multiple autonomous agents to collaborate in a complex, dynamic environment. These agents will need to accurately perceive both their environment (the worksite) and each other in order to efficiently allocate tasks, plan trajectories, and respond to disturbances all in the presence of uncertainties such as unknown payload characteristics and unmodeled effects.
Modular structures will increase ease of access to space. Modular platforms could host flight hardware and share power, data, Guidance, Navigation and Control (GN&C), and thermal regulation capabilities. Under this paradigm, technology demonstrations could be carried out without the need to design and operate an entire spacecraft. Modules could simply occupy space on the already existing platform. This constitutes a plug-and-play architecture which will require a common interface between modules such that required structural loads can be supported as well as power, data, and other services.
Modeling & simulation of structures and assembly agents is necessary for verifying autonomous agent algorithms and behavior used for structures that cannot be assembled on the ground.
Accurate sensing of complex and uncertain environments is necessary to provide autonomous agents with situational awareness to accomplish assembly tasks. Validation of the autonomous system behavior and in-space assembled structure accuracy in-situ will require in-space metrology capabilities.
The scope of this subtopic includes modular hardware and software systems:
",3 to 5,"Hardware, Software
","Software implementations and documentation verifying the efficacy of the designed algorithms Physical prototypes and documentation for the designed hardware
","As humans venture into deeper space, communication latency will increase to the point that autonomous operations are crucial. Current technologies for autonomous robots are low TRL, application specific, and fragile with respect to environmental uncertainties. To enable OSAM, these technologies must be made more resilient. Many interesting ideas exist in academia, but have yet to be made into a viable product.
Existing interfaces for modular trusses are purely structural. A critical gap is the development of interfaces that can exchange power, data, and other services over the interface.
","Achieving a robust and resilient autonomous solution for OSAM requires the intersection of many disciplines including mechanical and electrical systems, robotics, dynamics modeling, control theory, and computer science. NASA goals that would directly benefit from this work are future lunar exploration missions, including sustained human presence on the moon and persistent space platforms.

"Focus Area 15 Materials, Materials Research, Structures, and Assembly",H5.01Lunar Surface Solar Array Structures,,"NASA intends to land near the lunar south pole (between 85-90 S latitude) by 2024 in Phase 1 of the Artemis Program, and then to establish a sustainable long-term presence by 2028 in Phase 2. At exactly the lunar south pole (90 S), the Sun elevation angle varies between -1.5 deg and 1.5 deg during the year. At 85 S latitude, the elevation angle variation increases to between -6.5 deg and 6.5 deg. These persistently shallow sun grazing angles result in the interior of many polar craters never receiving sunlight while some nearby elevated ridges and plateaus receive sunlight up to 100% of the time in the summer and up to about 70% of the time in the winter. For this reason, these elevated sites are promising locations for human exploration and settlement because they avoid the excessively cold 14-day nights found elsewhere on the Moon while providing nearly continuous sunlight for site illumination, moderate temperatures, and solar power [Refs. 1-2].
This subtopic seeks structural and mechanical innovations for 10+ kW lightweight solar arrays near the south pole for powering landers, In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) equipment, lunar bases, and rovers, and that can deploy and retract at least 5 times. Retraction will allow solar array hardware to be relocated, repurposed, or refurbished and possibly also to minimize nearby rocket plume loads and dust accumulation. Also, innovations to raise the bottom of the solar array by up to 10 m to reduce shadowing from local terrain are of interest [Ref. 3]. Suitable innovations and variations of existing array concepts [e.g., Ref. 4] are of special interest.
Design guidelines for these deployable/retractable solar arrays are:
Deployed area: 35 m2 (10 kW) initially; up to 140 m2 (40 kW) eventually per unit. Single-axis sun tracking about the vertical axis. Adjustable leveling to within 10 deg of vertical. Retractable for relocating, repurposing, or refurbishing. Number of deploy/retract cycles in service: >5; stretch goal >10. Optional 10 m height extension boom to reduce shadowing from local terrain. Lunar dust, radiation, and temperature resistant mechanical and electrical components. Factor of safety of 1.5 on all components. Specific mass: >150 W/kg at 35 m2; >100 W/kg at 140 m2. Specific packing volume: >60 kW/m3 at 35 m2; >40 kW/m3 at 140 m2. Lifetime: >15 years.
Suggested areas of innovation include:
Novel packaging, deployment, retraction, and modularity concepts. Lightweight, compact components including booms, ribs, substrates, and mechanisms. Novel actuators for telescoping solar arrays with tubular segments of ~4 m length and ~0.2 m diameter such as gear/rack, piezoelectric, ratcheting, or rubber-wheel drive devices. Mechanisms with exceptionally high resistance to lunar dust. Load-limiting devices to avoid damage during deployment, retraction, and solar tracking. Optimized use of advanced lightweight materials (but not materials development). Validated modeling, analysis, and simulation techniques. High-fidelity, functioning laboratory models and test methods. Scaled flight hardware for demonstration on small or mid-size landers. Modular and adaptable solar array concepts for multiple lunar surface use cases. Completely new concepts; e.g., thinned “rigid panel” or 3D printed solar arrays, non-rotating telescoping “chimney” arrays, or lightweight reflectors to redirect sunlight onto solar arrays or into dark craters.
Proposals should emphasize structural and mechanical innovations, not photovoltaics, electrical, or energy storage innovations, although a complete solar array systems analysis is encouraged. If solar concentrators are proposed, strong arguments must be developed to justify why this approach is better from technical, cost, and risk points of view over unconcentrated planar solar arrays.
In Phase I, contractors should prove the feasibility of proposed innovations using suitable analyses and tests. In Phase II, significant hardware or software capabilities that can be tested at NASA should be developed to advance their Technology Readiness Level (TRL). TRL at the end of Phase II of 4 or higher is desired.
NASA has plans to purchase services for delivery of payloads to the Moon through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contract. Under this subtopic, proposals may include efforts to develop payloads for flight demonstration of relevant technologies in the lunar environment. The CLPS payload accommodations will vary depending on the particular service provider and mission characteristics. Additional information on the CLPS program and providers can be found at this link: https://www.nasa.gov/content/commercial-lunar-payload-services. CLPS missions will typically carry multiple payloads for multiple customers. Smaller, simpler, and more self-sufficient payloads are more easily accommodated and would be more likely to be considered for a NASA-sponsored flight opportunity. Commercial payload delivery services may begin as early as 2020 and flight opportunities are expected to continue well into the future. In future years it is expected that larger and more complex payloads will be accommodated. Selection for award under this solicitation will not guarantee selection for a lunar flight opportunity.

","Deployable solar arrays power almost all spacecraft, but they primarily consist of hinged, rigid panels. This traditional design is too heavy and packages too inefficiently for larger sizes of arrays above about 20 kW. Furthermore, there is usually no reason to retract the arrays in space, so self-retractable solar array concepts are unavailable except for rare exceptions such as the special-purpose International Space Station (ISS) solar array wings. In recent years, several lightweight solar array concepts have been developed but none of them have motorized retraction capability either. The critical technology gap filled by this subtopic is a lightweight, vertically deployed, retractable 10+ kW solar arrays for the surface power for ISRU, lunar bases, dedicated power landers and rovers.
","Robust, lightweight, redeployable solar arrays for lunar surface applications are a topic of great current interest to NASA on its path back to the moon. New this year, the subtopic extends the focus area from landers to other powered elements of the lunar surface architecture along with refined design guidelines. There are likely several infusion paths into ongoing and future lunar surface programs, both within NASA and also with commercial entities currently exploring options for a variety of lunar surface missions. Given the focus on the lunar South Pole, NASA will need vertically deployed and retractable solar arrays that generate 10-40 kW of power. 10 kW class solar array structures are also applicable for Science Mission Directorate (SMD) ConOps on the Moon to charge a Mars Science Laboratory (MSL)-class rover.

"Focus Area 15 Materials, Materials Research, Structures, and Assembly",T12.01Thin-Ply Composite Technology and Applications,,"The use of thin-ply composites is one area of composites technology that has not yet been fully explored or exploited. Thin-ply composites are those with cured ply thicknesses below 0.0025 in., and commercially available prepregs are now available with ply thicknesses as thin as 0.00075 in. By comparison, a standard-ply-thickness composite would have a cured ply thickness of approximately 0.0055 in. or greater. Thin-ply composites hold the potential for reducing structural mass and increasing performance due to their unique structural characteristics, which include (when compared to standard-ply-thickness composites):
Improved damage tolerance. Resistance to microcracking (including cryogenic-effects). Improved aging and fatigue resistance. Reduced minimum-gage thickness. Thinner sections capable of sustaining large deformations without damage. Increased scalability of structures.
The particular capabilities requested for potential Phase I proposals in this subtopic in line with the critical gaps between the state of the art and the technology needed are:
New processing methods for making repeatable, consistent, high quality thin-ply carbon-fiber prepreg materials, (i.e., greater than 55% fiber density with low degree of fiber twisting, misalignment and damage, low thickness non-uniformity and minimal gaps in the material across the width) using currently used and commercially available fiber/matrix combinations. The intent of this requirement is to provide thin-ply prepreg material with the same quality as the standard-ply material of the same material system in order to facilitate substitution of thin-ply into structural concepts, and while continuous fiber forms are sought, this does not preclude development of new and novel prepreg material forms. Prepreg product forms of interest have area weights below 60 g/m2 for unidirectional tape with tape widths between 6 and 300 mm wide, and below 120 g/m2 for woven/braided prepreg materials. Matrices of interest include both toughened epoxy resins for aeronautics applications, and resins qualified for use in space. Development of novel low creep and low stress relaxation polymer thin-ply composites for inflatable and rollable/foldable space structures. Amongst others, approaches of interest are: designing new molecular structures showing high restriction of distortion of atomic bond angle under stress; controlling cross-linking density by reactive functional groups of molecular chains to keep a good balance between restriction of molecular rearrangement and material brittleness; restricting large scale rearrangements of polymer molecules by second phase of components; and securing strong interfaces between reinforcing fibers and polymer matrix by chemical bonding or fiber sizing improvements to prevent fibers and polymer molecules slippage under load. The temperature dependent viscoelastic-plastic properties of the developed thin-ply material shall be characterized to predict the long-term behavior of the system under continuous loading. Fabrication of large, thin-gauge structures, such as deployable/rollable thin-shell booms or wing skins, are often limited in size by autoclave constraints. Innovative out-of-autoclave processing methods for thin-gauge structures are sought to facilitate the production of large structures. Additionally, the innovative method shall guarantee the curing process variables (temperature, pressure, etc.) are uniform over the long parts to achieve better final products with less process-related defects and part-to-part variability. Cure-induced deformation of thin composite structures such as the spring-in effect is a known phenomenon that affects part accuracy during fabrication. Simulation software compatible with general purpose finite element environments such as ABAQUS or ANSYS for predictions of the manufacturing process-induced deformations and residual stresses are sought. These software tools should be tailored to the modeling needs of thin-ply composite structures, especially for structures with a final thickness under 1.5 mm. In addition, simulation capability of sequential multi-step processes (cure and post-bonding) as well as complex process (composite sections co-cure and/or co-bond) are of special interest. The goal is to develop recommendations for geometric tool compensation, as well as cure cycles and tooling that meets cure cycle specifications. Fracture mechanics models for thin-shell, thin-ply polymer composites subjected to large continuous and cyclic bending strains (>2%) for which the nonlinear and viscoelastic-plastic response of the material plays an important role on the damage initiation and progression in the foldable/rollable/deformable structural member. Multi-scale failure models for spread-tow woven/braided lamina, as well as laminates that combine these with spread-tow unidirectional plies are sought. The study of material creep rupture, thermal fatigue, mechanical fatigue and resin micro-cracking at lower strains (< 1%), as related to environmental ageing, durability and dimensional stability of the final thin-ply composite structure is of special interest as part of a larger goal to qualify thin-shell, flexible composite structures for space flight. Testing and micromechanics models capable of identifying damage initiation and growth for hybrid thin-ply composites are sought. Specifically, methods for composites comprising thin and standard unidirectional plies, and composites combining different forms, such as combining unidirectional plies with woven or braided plies of the same or dissimilar areal weights.

","The Phase II deliverables will depend on the aspect addressed, but in general will be manufacturing processes, documentation of the analytical foundation and process, maturing the necessary design/analysis codes, and validation of the approach through design, build, and test of an article representative of a component/application of interest to NASA.
","Thin-ply composites are attractive for a number of applications in both aeronautics and space as they have the potential for significant weight savings over the current state-of-the-art standard-ply materials due to improved performance. For example, preliminary analyses show that the notched strength of a hybrid of thin and standard ply layers can increase the notched tensile strength of composite laminates by 30%. Thus, selective incorporation of thin plies into composite aircraft structures may significantly reduce their mass. There are numerous possibilities for space applications. The resistance to microcracking and fatigue makes thin-ply composites an excellent candidate for a deep-space habitation structure where hermeticity is critical. Since the designs of these types of pressurized structures are typically constrained by minimum gage considerations, the ability to reduce that minimum gage thickness also offers the potential for significant mass reductions. For other space applications, the reduction in thickness enables: thin-walled, deployable structural concepts only a few plies thick that can be folded/rolled under high strains for launch (and thus have high packaging efficiencies) and deployed in orbit; and, greater freedom in designing lightweight structures for satellite buses, landers, rovers, solar arrays, and antennas. For these reasons, NASA is interested in exploring the use of thin-ply composites for aeronautics applications requiring very high structural efficiency, for pressurized structures (such as habitation systems and tanks), for lightweight deep-space exploration systems, and for low-mass high stiffness deployable space structures (such as rollable booms or foldable panels, hinges or reflectors).
There are many needs in development, qualification and deployment of composite structures incorporating thin-ply materials – either alone or as a hybrid system with standard ply composite materials. In particular, there is substantial interest in proposals that address manufacturability and production of composite structures utilizing thin-ply composites that at minimum develop the process and plan for the production of one prototype in Phase 1, and demonstrate reproducibility of prototype manufacturing and key parameter validation of repeated samples in Phase 2. Available predictive manufacturing-cure-induced deformation/residual stress software uses solid finite elements to represent the composite plies and those result in high aspect ratios elements when thin-ply materials are used, which ultimately derive in computationally expensive models or loss of convergence. New ways of modeling thin-ply materials are thus needed on these specialized software, particularly for complex-shaped, thin-shell structures just a few plies thick. Another area requiring development is in fracture initiation/progression mechanism models, efficient homogenization methods for spread-tow textile fabrics and hybrid (textile and unidirectional plies) laminates that include viscoelastic-viscoplastic and thermo-mechanical response, and new large deformation testing and analysis methods adapted for thin-ply composites subjected to high bending strains (>1.5%) for foldable and/or rollable thin-shell structures. Finally, polymer matrix composites subjected to high strains for a long-period of time are particularly susceptible to stress relaxation or creep. New thin-ply polymer composites materials for space applications tailored for low relaxation/creep response under large bending deformations and high strains, such as for rollable or foldable thin-shell structures, are needed.
","The most applicable Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) program is Advanced Air Vehicles Program (AAVP), and within that is Advanced Air Transport Technologies (AATT). Additional projects withing AAVP that could leverage this technology are: Commercial Supersonic Technology (CST), Hypersonic Technology (HT), and Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technologies (RVLT). Projects within Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program (TACP) could also benefit. That is, any project in need of lightweight structures can benefit from the thin-ply technology development.
Within Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), projects with deployable composite booms, landing struts, foldable reflectors, and other very lightweight structures can benefit from the thin-ply technology.

"Focus Area 15 Materials, Materials Research, Structures, and Assembly",T12.05Deposition and Curing of Thermoset Resin Mixtures for Thermal Protection,,"NASA has a need to significantly improve the manufacturing processes of Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) used in human-rated spacecraft with the intention of reducing cost and improving quality and system performance. The fabrication and installation of current TPS are labor intensive, cost prohibitive, and result in many seams between the segments. Future human missions to Mars will require the landing of large-mass payloads on the surface, and these large entry vehicles will require large areas of TPS to protect the structure. A sustained lunar presence will require the development of Lunar-return vehicles which will also need TPS. In order to reduce the cost and complexity of these vehicles, new TPS materials and compatible additive manufacturing techniques are being developed such that thermoset-resin based mixtures can be deposited, bonded and cured on spacecraft structures with automated systems. Typically, these thermoset resin systems are filled with fibers, microballoons, rheology modifiers and other additives. Technologies are sought to mix and feed, and then deposit and cure these highly filled thermoset resin mixtures on the flight structure. Basic requirements and goals for the material system are provided in the references.
This subtopic seeks to develop the materials and subsystems needed to design, fabricate and operate an automated production process for TPS. The technologies needing development include:
Compatible thermoset resin mixtures, extruder and tool-path algorithms to produce uniform printed and cured TPS material with voids/flaws less than 1/8”. Printable resins yielding TPS materials with low coefficient of thermal expansion. Approaches could include additives to thermoset resin mixtures or alternate material systems potentially with imbedded and longer fibers. Capability to vary the resin-mixture composition during the layer deposition to produce an insulative layer at the structure and a more robust layer on the outer surface. Scalable material feed systems to transport the material to the extruder head(s). Mixing the raw materials in the feed system is desirable. Cure/set the highly filled thermoset resin mixture on the flight structure without the need for large ovens. Curing can be accomplished by chemical composition and/or external energy sources, such as, but not limited to, radio frequency (RF) generators, ultraviolet (UV) lights, etc. Processes and subsystems to ensure a good bond between the deposited material and high-temperature carbon-fiber composite structures.
During Phase I, the focus should be to develop and demonstrate, on a small scale, a solution to at least one of the technologies described above using a candidate thermoset resin mixture. Concepts for the other technologies should be developed during Phase I and then further developed and demonstrated in Phase II.
",2 to 4,"Prototype, Analysis, Hardware, Research
","Phase I deliverables should include a small scale demonstration of the resin mixture printing and curing process and also include printed and cured material samples for testing. The goal deliverables for Phase II would include the demonstration of a prototype system with a clear path for scale up to production of a full-size heat shield and the demonstrated capability to print, cure and bond acceptable TPS materials on a small, non-planar composite structure.
","Current state of the art (SOA) for manufacturing and installing thermal protection on NASA space vehicles is too labor intensive and too costly. Furthermore, the heat shield designs are constrained by manufacturing processes that result in segmented blocks with gap fillers that create flight performance issues. To develop an automated additive manufacturing process for spacecraft heat shields that are monolithic, the development of the materials and technologies to deposit and cure the materials on the flight structures are needed.
","Both Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) and Science Mission Directorate (SMD) would benefit from this technology. All missions that include a spacecraft that enters a planetary atmosphere require TPS to protect the structure from the high-heating associated with hypersonic flight. Improved performance and lower cost heat shields benefit the development and operation of these spacecraft. Human missions to the moon and Mars would benefit from this technology. Commercial Space programs would also benefit from TPS materials and manufacturing processes developed by NASA.

"Focus Area 15 Materials, Materials Research, Structures, and Assembly","Z4.04Real Time Defect Detection, Identification and Correction in Wire-Feed Additive Manufacturing Processes","Development of Real Time Defect Detection, Identification and Correction in Wire-Feed Additive Manufacturing Processes
","Additive Manufacturing (AM) (also referred to here as 3D printing) offers the ability to build light-weight components that are optimally suited for use in aerospace applications. Significant strides have been made in the development of AM with 3D printed components now being part of active aircraft and spacecraft1,2,3. While the use of AM has enabled non-traditional designs and decreased part counts, full inspection of each component is typically required post-build to determine fitness for the final application. Complex geometries, rough as-built surface finishes, and porosity can hinder inspection. If 100% inspection is not possible, proof test logic or some other method of proving fitness for use must be applied4. Defects that occur can force a complete reprint. The ultimate promise of AM is to enable on-demand production of customized unique components. For utility in space applications, printed parts have to be fully functional with zero to minimal post processing. Ideally, parts need to be built with acceptable form, fit, and function the first time, with sufficient documentation to allow direct entry into service. To enable the full realization of the potential of 3D printing, a capability for closed loop control of the process that integrates in situ monitoring, real-time defect detection and identification, & print parameter modification is required.
Wire-feed or extrusion type AM, with its relative simplicity, wide range of feedstocks and build volume flexibility is a popular 3D printing technique that is well suited to space applications 6. Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) and Electron Beam Free Form Fabrication (EBF3) are useful examples of wire-feed processes to illustrate the limitations placed on AM by presently available design and process control tools. After designing an object using 3D modeling software, the geometry is passed to a slicing and tool path planning code, which generates the list of instructions needed by the printing hardware. Once received by the printer, no further modifications or corrections can be made, and the process continues to completion.
Proposals are invited to advance the manufacturing technology by incorporating an in situ defect detection and correction capability into wire-feed or extrusion type metallic, plastic or composite AM.
In Phase I, contractors should prove the feasibility of integrating sensor feedback with appropriate software tools and computation resources to be able to detect defects during fabrication of parts with complex geometries, evaluating the potential impact of the defects to the part performance and the correction of those defects. Solutions sought include the software that can be integrated into the 3D printing workflow, hardware requirements to run that software for real-time data processing and sensors capable of operating in the build environment to provide data also in real time. The proposed approach should be demonstrable at least on the coupon scale for shapes such as circles or boxes.
Phase II, should demonstrate the feasibility of Phase I concepts to arrive at closed loop solutions to build parts in which information on the processing generated from gathering and analyzing sensor data is used for the prediction of part performance, unique to each individual part, as it is being built. Incorporation of defect correction during fabrication, rather than requiring a print to be scrapped and restarted should be demonstrated on sample parts.
",2 to 3,"Prototype, Analysis, Hardware, Software, Research
","In Phase I, concept studies documenting the feasibility of incorporating sensor data feedback and appropriate software tools and computation resources to be used to detect defects during fabrication of parts with complex geometries, evaluating the potential impact of the defects on the performance of the parts and the correction of those defects.
Phase II, scale demonstration of a printer with closed loop control that incorporates defect detection, identification and correction during fabrication. The complexity of defects that are detected and corrected as well as the size of the parts should demonstrate the challenges that would come up in full-scale use of the control processes. Printed part sizes should be at least 10 cm per side for cubes with detectable defects down to the mm scale or smaller. The defects should have a demonstrable effect on the part performance, such as a decrease in mechanical properties that is then corrected for by the process.
","Additive Manufacturing is seeing rapidly expanding applications in many areas including in aerospace. Despite this growth in AM, fulling its full potential has always been limited by quality control issues and certification of the manufactured parts as each component that is built is unique6. Some work has begun to add defect detection and correction to powder based manufacturing processes such as Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS)7,8 and wire-feed AM9. There has however not been the requisite advance in ensuring that defect detection and identification is coupled with the real-time correction of those defects and ensuring final performance of the manufacture part in a particular application.
Gap: Real-time defect detection, identification and correction in AM processes, which would ensure the performance of the as-printed parts without relying on post production inspection processes, with parts built with acceptable form, fit, and function the first time, with sufficient documentation to allow direct entry into service has not been demonstrated.
","This topic fits under STMD (Space Technology Mission Directorate). It supports Advanced Manufacturing of Lightweight Structures. Enhancing quality control in AM opens up its use in many industrial applications as well as for NASA use. In particular, in-space use of AM in future Gateway, Lunar and Mars exploration missions will require that parts that are produced are ready for use as-produced since there will be limitations in availability of material for re-printing as well as crew time and equipment for post-printing inspection.

"Focus Area 15 Materials, Materials Research, Structures, and Assembly","Z4.05Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) Sensors, Modeling, and Analysis",,"NASA’s Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) SBIR subtopic will address a wide variety of NDE disciplines. These disciplines include but are not limited to Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), Novel NDE Sensor Development and NDE Modeling and analysis. All three of these disciplines can be used on aerospace structures and materials systems including but not limited to Inconel, Titanium, Aluminum, Carbon Fiber, Avcoat, ATB-8, Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) and thermal blanket structures. Sensor systems, SHM and modeling can target any set of these materials in common aerospace configurations such as Micro-Meteoroids and Orbital Debris (MMOD) shielding, Truss Structures and Stiffened Structures. In addition NDE can target material and material systems in a wrought state, in process and NDE techniques that could be used to inspect additively manufactured components would be favored. Current NDE computational tools do not have sufficient resolution to provide representation on the order of Finite Element Model (FEM) models allowing for Digital Twin. Depending on the size of the critical flaw in the material system / structure this resolution can range from 500nm to 100cm realistically. As NDE tool resolution grows larger volumes of data are created and thus new computational tools are required. At the same time, low cost emerging computational hardware, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), is enabling the growing use of advanced physics based models for improved NDE inspection and for advanced data analysis methods such as Machine Learning. In addition as NASA strives to go deeper and longer new tools need to be developed in order to support long duration space flight.
NDE sensors and data analysis:
Technologies enabling the ability to perform inspections on large complex structures will be encouraged. Technologies should provide reliable assessments of the location and extent of damage. Methods are desired to perform inspections in areas with difficult access in pressurized habitable compartments and external environments for flight hardware. Many applications require the ability to see through assembled conductive and/or thermal insulating materials without contacting the surface.
Techniques that can dynamically and accurately determine position and orientation of the NDE sensor are needed to automatically register NDE results to precise locations on the structure. Advanced processing and displays are needed to reduce the complexity of operations for astronaut crews who need to make important assessments quickly. NDE inspection sensors are needed for potential use on free-flying inspection platforms. Integration of wireless systems with NDE may be of significant utility. It is strongly encouraged that proposals provide an explanation of how the proposed techniques and sensors will be applied to a complex structure. Examples of structural components include but are not limited to multi-wall pressure vessels, batteries, tile, thermal blankets, micrometeoroid shielding, International Space Station (ISS) Radiators or aerospace structural components.
Additionally, techniques for quantitative data analysis of sensor data are desired. It is also considered highly desirable to develop tools for automating detection of material Foreign Object Debris (FOD) and/or defects and evaluation of bondline and in-depth integrity for light-weight rigid and/or flexible ablative materials are sought. Typical internal void volume detection requirements for ablative materials are on the order of less than 6mm and bondline defect detection requirements are less than 25mm.
Additive manufacturing is rapidly becoming a manufacturing method targeting fracture critical components and as such NDE requirements will become more stringent. Additively manufactured components represent a novel challenge for NDE due to the layering nature of the process and it effect on diffracting energy sources. Additive manufacturing also offers an additional chance for in-process inspection. Development of NDE techniques, sensors and methods addressing these issues would be highly desired. But techniques addressing weld inspection will also be considered. Most of the aerospace components will be metallic in nature and critical flaws are on the range of 1mm or smaller and can be volumetric or fracture like in nature.
Structural Health Monitoring (SHM):
Future manned space missions will require spacecraft and launch vehicles that are capable of monitoring the structural health of the vehicle and diagnosing and reporting any degradation in vehicle capability. This subtopic seeks new and innovative technologies in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) systems and analysis tools.
Techniques sought include modular/low mass-volume systems, low power, low maintenance systems, and systems that reduce or eliminate wiring, as well as stand-alone smart-sensor systems that provide processed data as close to the sensor as practical and systems that are flexible in their applicability. Examples of possible system are: Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW)-based sensors, passive wireless sensor-tags, flexible sensors for highly curved surfaces direct-write film sensors, and others. Damage detection modes include leak detection, ammonia detection, micrometeoroid impact and others. Reduction in the complexity of standard wires and connectors and enabling sensing functions in locations not normally accessible with previous technologies is also desirable. Proposed techniques should be capable of long term service with little or no intervention. Sensor systems should be capable of identifying material state awareness and distinguish aging related phenomena and damage related conditions. It is considered advantageous that these systems perform characterization of age-related degradation in complex composite and metallic materials. Measurement techniques and analysis methods related to quantifying material thermal properties, elastic properties, density, microcrack formation, fiber buckling and breakage, etc. in complex composite material systems, adhesively bonded/built-up and/or polymer-matrix composite sandwich structures are of particular interest. Some consideration will be given to the IVHM /SHM ability to survive in on-orbit and deep space conditions, allow for additions or changes in instrumentation late in the design/development process and enable relocation or upgrade on orbit. System should allow NASA to gain insight into performance and safety of NASA vehicles as well as commercial launchers, vehicles and payloads supporting NASA missions. Inclusion of a plan for detailed technical operation and deployment is highly favored.
NDE Modeling:
Technologies sought under this SBIR include near real-time realistic NDE and SHM simulations and automated data reduction/analysis methods for large data sets. Simulation techniques will seek to expand NASA’s use of physics based models to predict inspection coverage for complex aerospace components and structures and to utilize inverse methods for improved defect characterization. Analysis techniques should include optimized automated reduction of NDE/SHM data for enhanced interpretation appropriate for detection/ characterization of critical flaws in space flight structures and components, and may involve methods such as machine learning, domain transformation, etc. NASA's interest area is light weight structural materials for space flight such as composites and thin metals. Future purposes will include application to long duration space vehicles, as well as validation of SHM systems.
Techniques sought include advanced material-energy interaction (i.e., NDE) simulations for high-strength lightweight material systems and include energy interaction with realistic damage in complex 3D component geometries (such as bonded/built-up structures). Primary material systems can include metals but it is highly desirable to target composite structures. NDE/SHM techniques for simulation can include ultrasonic, laser, Micro- wave, Terahertz, Infrared, X-ray, X-ray Computed Tomography, Fiber Optic, backscatter X-Ray and eddy current. It is assumed that any data analysis methods will be focused on NDE techniques with high resolution high volume data. Modeling efforts should be physics based and it is desired they can account for material aging characteristics and induced damage, such as micrometeoroid impact. Examples of damage states of interest include delamination, microcracking, porosity, fiber breakage. Techniques sought for data reduction/interpretation will yield automated and accurate results to improve quantitative data interpretation to reduce large amounts of NDE/SHM data into a meaningful characterization of the structure. It is advantageous to use co-processor/accelerator based hardware [e.g., GPUs, Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGA)] for simulation and data reduction. Combined simulation and data reduction/interpretation techniques should demonstrate ability to guide the development of optimized NDE/SHM techniques, lead to improved inspection coverage predictions, and yield quantitative data interpretation for damage characterization.

At the same time, low cost emerging computational hardware, such as GPUs, is enabling the growing use of advanced physics based models for improved NDE inspection and for advanced data analysis methods such as Machine Learning. Development of new techniques are enabling Orion to meet its 100% inspected mission directive. In addition as NASA strives to go deeper and longer new tools need to be developed in order to support long duration space flight.
","Several missions could benefit from technology developed in the Area of nondestructive evaluation. Currently NASA is returning to manned space flight. The Orion/Space Launch System and Artemis program has continuing to have inspection difficulties and continued development and implementation of NDE tools will serve to keep our missions flying safely. Currently Orion is using several techniques and prototypes that have been produced under the NDE SBIR topic. Space Launch System is NASA’s next heavy lift system. Capable of sending hundreds of metric tons into orbit. Inspection of the various systems is on-going and will continue to have challenges such as verification of the friction stir weld on the fuel tanks.

Focus Area 16 Ground & Launch Processing,H10.01Advanced Propulsion Systems Ground Test Technology,"Advanced Propulsion Test Technology Development
","Rocket propulsion development is enabled by rigorous ground testing to mitigate the propulsion system risks that are inherent in spaceflight. This is true for virtually all propulsive devices of a space vehicle including liquid and solid rocket propulsion, chemical and non-chemical propulsion, boost stage, in-space propulsion and so forth. It involves a combination of component and engine-level testing to demonstrate the propulsion devices were designed to meet the specified requirements for a specified operational envelope over robust margins and shown to be sufficiently reliable prior to its first flight.
This topic area seeks to develop advanced ground test technology components and system level ground test systems that enhance Chemical and Advanced Propulsion technology development and certification. The goal is to advance propulsion ground test technologies to; enhance environment simulation, minimize test program time, cost and risk; and meet existing environmental and safety regulations. It is focused on near-term products that augment and enhance proven, state-of-the-art propulsion test facilities. This project is especially interested in ground test and launch environment technologies with potential to substantially reduce the costs and improve safety/reliability of NASA's test and launch operations.
In particular, technology needs include stable combustion of oxygen and hydrogen in a low pressure duct, developing robust materials, and advanced instruments and monitoring systems capable of operating in extreme temperature and harsh environments.
This subtopic seeks innovative technologies in the following areas:
Design of technology/techniques for oxygen injection into a duct that assures stable combustion with hot (>1700°R) hydrogen at low pressure (<25 psia), having an oxidizer to fuel mixture ratio of 9 for an oxygen flow rate of approximately 2.7 lbm/sec. This technology solution must be extensible to a system having an oxygen flow rate of approximately 270 lbm/sec. Devices for measurement of pressure, temperature, strain and radiation in a high temperature and/or harsh environment. Development of innovative rocket test facility components (e.g., valves, flowmeters, actuators, tanks, etc.) for ultra-high pressure (>8000 psi), high flow rate (>100 lbm/sec) and cryogenic environments. Robust and reliable component designs which are oxygen compatible and can operate efficiently in high vibro-acoustic, environments. Advanced materials to resist high-temperature (<4400°F), hydrogen embrittlement and harsh environments. Tools using computational methods to accurately model and predict system performance that integrate simple interfaces with detailed design and/or analysis software, are required. Stennis Space Center (SSC) is interested in improving capabilities and methods to accurately predict and model the transient fluid structure interaction between cryogenic fluids and immersed components to predict the dynamic loads and frequency response of facilities. Improved capabilities to predict and model the behavior of components (valves, check valves, chokes, etc.) during the facility design process are needed. This capability is required for modeling components in high pressure (to 12,000 psi), with flow rates up to several thousand lb/sec, in cryogenic environments and must address two-phase flows. Challenges include: accurate, efficient, thermodynamic state models; cavitation models for propellant tanks, valve flows, and run lines; reduction in solution time; improved stability; acoustic interactions; fluid-structure interactions in internal flows.
For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards Phase II hardware/software demonstration with delivery of a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.

There is a broad range of technologies needed to support rocket propulsion testing. Dynamic fluid flow simulation is used to characterize and model the facility performance in a highly dynamic environment with NASA, Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial customers. Multiple issues remain with modeling combustion instabilities and component/facility performance. These issues can have catastrophic results if not understood completely. New test programs will require the materials to withstand extreme temperatures and harsh environments. Next generation testing requires the ability to produce very high temperature hydrogen at high near-continuous flow rates to verify component and facility performance.

Focus Area 16 Ground & Launch Processing,H10.02Autonomous Operations Technologies for Ground and Launch Systems,,"Autonomous Operations Technologies (AOT) are required to reduce operations and maintenance (O&M) costs of ground and payload processing operations on ground, and to increase ground systems availability to support mission operations. These technologies will also be required for extended surface O&M on the Moon and Mars. Furthermore, AOT are required in activities where human intervention/interaction/presence needs to be minimized, such as in hazardous locations/operations and in support of remote operations.
AOT performs functions such as systems and components’ fault prediction and diagnostics, anomaly detection, fault detection and isolation, and enables various levels of autonomous control and recovery from faults, where recovery may include system repair and/or reconfiguration. AOT are enabled by Health Management (HM) technologies, methodologies, and approaches; command, monitoring and control architectures; computing architectures; software for decision-making and control; and intelligent components and devices.
AOT will be integrated in activities performed by rocket engine test facilities, propellant servicing systems, and processing and launch of vehicles and payloads. AOT will complement In-Situ Resources Utilization (ISRU) operations. AOT will enable surface O&M, which requires high degree of autonomy and reliability for unattended operations during extended periods of time. AOT enables Autonomous Propellant Management (APM), which requires unattended or minimally attended storage, transfer, monitoring, and sampling of cryogenic propellants, or other propellants use in launch systems. APM includes pre-planned nominal processes, such as vehicle fill and drain, as well as contingency and off-nominal processes, such as emergency safing, venting and system reconfiguration.
AOT will enable the autonomous command, monitoring and control of the overall system, resulting from the integration of loading systems and all other associated support systems involved in the loading process. AOT will also support tasks such as systems setup, testing and checkout, troubleshooting, maintenance, upgrades and repair. These additional tasks drive the need for autonomous element-to-element interface connection and separation, multi-element inspection, and recovery of high value cryogenic propellants and gases to avoid system losses.
The AOT autonomy software will include both prerequisite control logic (PCL) and reaction control logic (RCL) programming, and may utilize some form of machine learning, neural network or other form of artificial intelligence to adapt to degraded system components or other form of off-nominal conditions.
In addition to cryogenic and other propellants, propellant management systems may utilize additional commodities to prepare a vehicle for launch, such as high pressure gases for purges, pressurization, or conditioning, and may include power and data interfaces with the vehicle to configure vehicle valves or other internal systems and utilize on-board instrumentation to gain visibility into the vehicle during loading.
Specifically, this subtopic seeks the:
Standardization of architectures and interfaces Standardization of ground systems design (design for maintainability, commonality, reusability) Development of ground technologies for automated/autonomous cryogenic loading and servicing of commodities for ground and lunar payloads Development of high-fidelity physics-based cryogenic-thermal models and simulations capable of real-time and faster than real-time performance Development of high-fidelity models and simulations for complex payload systems Development of automated/autonomous algorithms for ground systems applications Development of Test and Evaluation (T&E), and verification and validation (V&V) methods for automated/autonomous algorithms, models and simulations Development of technologies for ground systems Health Determination and Fault Management Prediction, prognosis and anomaly detection algorithms and applications Detection, isolation, and recovery of systems and components faults and degradation Development of Test and Evaluation (T&E), and verification and validation (V&V) methods for Health Determination and Fault Management algorithms and applications Development of technologies for automated/autonomous Planning and Scheduling (P&S) Automated/Autonomous Assets management tools and applications Scheduling and prioritization algorithms and applications Human-machine information interactions Development of technologies for automated/autonomous Inspection, Maintenance and Repair Use of robotic caretakers for inspection, maintenance and repair needs Self-diagnosis in systems and components (Condition Based Maintenance) Development of technologies for enhanced Logistics and Reliability Optimization/Reduction of logistics needs (design for maintainability, commonality, reusability) Commonality of maintenance equipment, tools and consumables Automated/autonomous assets and personnel location and condition Intelligent Devices (sensors, actuators and electronics with self-diagnosis capabilities, calibration on demand, self-healing capabilities, etc.)

Concept methodology should include the path for adaptation of the technology, infusion strategies (including risk trades) and business model. It should identify improvements over the current state of the art for both operations and systems development and the feasibility of the approach in a multi-customer environment. Bench or lab-level demonstrations are desirable. Deliverables must include a report documenting findings.

","Rocket propulsion system development is enabled by rigorous ground testing to mitigate the propulsion system risks inherent in spaceflight. Test articles and facilities are highly instrumented to enable a comprehensive analysis of propulsion system performance. Advanced instrumentation has the potential for substantial reduction in time and cost of propulsion systems development, with substantially reduced operational costs and evolutionary improvements in ground, launch and flight system operational robustness.
Advanced instrumentation would provide a wireless, highly flexible instrumentation solution capable of measurement of heat flux, temperature, pressure, strain, and/or near-field acoustics. Temperature and pressure measurements must be acquired from within the facility mechanical systems or the rocket engine itself. These sensors would be capable of addressing multiple mission requirements for remote monitoring such as vehicle health monitoring in flight systems, autonomous vehicle operation, or instrumenting inaccessible measurement locations, all while eliminating cabling and auxiliary power. Rocket propulsion test facilities also provide excellent test beds for testing and using the innovative technologies for possible application beyond the static propulsion testing environment.
This subtopic seeks to develop advanced wireless instrumentation capable of performing some processing, gathering sensory information and communicating with other connected nodes in the network. Sensor systems should have the ability to provide the following functionality:
Acquisition and conversion to engineering units for quantifying heat flux, temperature, pressure, strain, and/or near-field acoustics such that it contributes to rocket engine system performance analysis within established standards for error and uncertainty. Capable of in-place calibrations with The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceability.

These ranges may be from extremely cold temperatures, such as cryogenic temperatures, to extremely high temperatures, such as those experienced near a rocket engine plume.

","For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards Phase II hardware/software demonstration with delivery of a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.
","Highly modular, remote sensors are of interest to many NASA tests and missions. Real-time data from sensor networks reduces risk and provides data for future design improvements. Wireless sensors offer a highly flexible solution for scientists and engineers to collect data remotely. They can be used for thermal, structural and acoustic measurement of systems and subsystems and also provide emergency system halt instructions in the case of leaks, fire or structural failure. Other examples of potential NASA applications include 1) measuring temperature, strain, voltage and current from power storage and generation systems, 2) measuring pressure, strain and temperature in pumps and pressure vessels and 3) measuring strain in test structures, ground support equipment and vehicles, including high-risk deployables.
There are many other applications that would benefit from increased, real-time sensing in remote, hard-to-test locations. For example, sensor networks on a vehicle body can give measurement of temperature, pressure, strain and acoustics. This data is used in real time to determine safety margins and test anomalies. The data is also used post-test to correlate analytical models and optimize vehicle and test design. Because these sensors are small and low mass, they can be used for ground test and for flight. Sensor module miniaturization will further reduce size, mass and cost.
No existing wireless sensor network option meets NASA’s current needs for flexibility, size, mass and resilience to extreme environments.

Focus Area 17 Thermal Management Systems,S3.06Thermal Control Systems,Dust Mitigation Thermal Coatings,"Thermal coatings are an integral part of a space mission and are essential to the survivability of the spacecraft and instrument. Coating of the radiator with desired emissivity and absorptivity on the radiator surface provides a passive means for instrument temperature control. The utilization of variable emittance devices further enables active control of the instrument temperature when the heat output from the instrument or the thermal environment of the radiator changes. With NASA’s new initiative to return to the moon, a new coating technology that will keep surfaces clean and sanitary is needed. New coating formulations utilizing durable, anti-contamination and self-cleaning properties that will disallow the accumulation of dust, dirt and foreign materials are highly desirable. These coatings can have low absorptance and high IR emittance properties or be transparent for use on existing thermal coating systems. The goal of this technology is to preserve optimal long-term performance of spacecraft and habitation components and systems.

","There are limited options for durable, stable thermal control coatings that are dust shedding in charging environments. Current state of the art, sprayable radiation stable coatings are able to coat complex, irregular surfaces, but they are porous and will become imbedded with dust and particulates. Other surface films tend to be less optically stable and may charge in the plasma environment thereby attracting lunar regolith to their surfaces. Mirrors have the limitations of requiring flat surfaces and are not conformal in nature. Currently, no single thermal control surface appears to provide stability, durability, and meet optical property requirements for sustained durations in space and lunar environments.

Focus Area 17 Thermal Management Systems,S3.06Thermal Control Systems,"Heat Pumps for High Temperature Sink Environments
","Operations in extreme environments where the environment sink temperature exceeds spacecraft hardware limits will require active cooling if long duration survivability is expected. Robotic science rovers operating on the Lunar surface over diurnal cycles face extreme temperature environments. Landers with clear views to sky can often achieve sufficient heat rejection with a zenith or, if sufficiently far from the equator, an anti-sun facing radiator. However, science rovers must accommodate random orientations with respect to the surface and Sun. Terrain features can then result in hot environment sink temperatures beyond operating limits, even with shielded and articulated radiator assemblies. Lunar dust degradation on radiator thermo-optical properties can also significantly affect effective sink temperatures. During the Lunar night, heat rejection paths must be turned off to preclude excessive battery mass or properly routed to reclaim nuclear-based waste heat.
Science needs may drive rovers to extreme terrains where steady heat rejection is not otherwise possible. The paradigm of swarms or multiple smaller rovers enabled by commercial lander opportunities will need to leverage standard rover bus designs to permit flexibility. A heat pump provides the common extensibility for thermal control over the lunar diurnal. Active cooling systems or heat pumps are commonly used on spacecraft. Devices used include mechanical cryocoolers and thermoelectric coolers. For higher loads, vapor compression systems have been flown and, more recently, reverse turbo Brayton-cycle coolers are being developed under NASA's Game Changing program for high load, high temperature lift cryocoolers. However, technology gaps exist for mid-range heat pumps that are suitable for small science rovers where internal heat dissipation may range from 20 Watts to 100 Watts.

C or heat rejection rate of 230 W/m2), with a system coefficient of performance > 2.5. System should be tolerant of being powered down during the lunar night and re-started during the day reliably over multiple diurnals. Exported vibrations, if any, should be minimal for compatibility with science instruments.
Novel heat pump systems are desired. Enabling improvements over state-of-the-art systems are also welcome.

This analysis often utilizes models generated in software unique to each field. The models, or their outputs, are transferred between analysts, creating iterative and time consuming design cycles. Software packages do exist that provide multiphysics analysis or coupling between analysis programs; however, the packages can be difficult to learn/implement and cost prohibitive.

","A loop heat pipe (LHP) is a very versatile heat transport device that has been used on many spacecraft. At the heart of the LHP is the evaporator and reservoir assembly. During the manufacturing, tedious processes are required to machine the porous primary wick and insert into the evaporator, and both ends of the wick need to be sealed for liquid and vapor separation. One commonly used method for vapor seal is to use a bimetallic knife edge joint, which is more prone to failure over long term exposure to thermal cycles and shock and vibration. These tedious manufacturing processes add to the cost of the traditional LHP. A new manufacturing technique that will allow the primary wick to be welded directly to the reservoir without the use of a knife-edge seal is needed in order to reduce the cost and enhance the reliability.

","The LHP evaporator contains a porous wick which provides the capillary pumping capability to sustain the fluid flow in the loop. The smaller the size, the higher the capillary pumping capability. On the other hand, the smaller the pore size, the higher the flow resistance which must be overcome by the capillary force. Traditional sintered metal wicks have a pore size on the order of 1 micron and porosity around 0.4-0.6. In order to replace the traditional porous wick, the new wick produced by the advanced manufacturing technology must have comparable pore size and porosity.

","The lunar environment poses significant challenges to small, low power (~100W or less) payloads, rovers, and landers required for lunar science. The lunar day/night cycle is approximately one earth month. During that time, surface temperatures on the lunar surface can reach 400K at local solar noon or drop to below 100K during the lunar night, even colder in permanently shadowed regions. These hot and cold conditions can last several earth days due to the slow rotation of the moon or permanently in shadowed craters. Lunar dust deposited on heat rejection surfaces and coatings will increase the heat absorbed from the Sun, thus reducing the effectiveness of radiators for heat rejection. The lunar gravity, which is 1/6th of the Earth's, will limit the ability of typical low power heat transport devices.
This call seeks to solicit innovative proposals to enable lunar science in the difficult lunar environment. Some technologies may include, but are not limited to, active loops that may be turned off and are freeze tolerate, zero or low power heat generation sources, high thermal capacitance thermal storage, advanced insulation, passive switching. Technologies should show substantial increase over the state-of-the-art. Considerations include power usage in day and night/shadow, mass, heat transport when turned on, heat leak when turned off, sensitivity to lunar topography and orientation, etc.
",3 to 4,"Prototype, Analysis, Hardware
","Thermal management approaches, techniques, and hardware components to enable the accommodation of lunar temperature extremes encountered in the lunar environment.
","Missions like Surveyor and Lunokhod hibernated during the night or reduced operational power near noon, in attempts to survive single or multiple lunar cycles. ALSEP’s (Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package) were deployed on several Apollo missions and had select experiments that operated for many lunar cycles. However, both Lunokhod and ALSEP benefited from radioisotope heat and power sources, which are either too expensive or not likely to be available for near term future lunar science experiments. In fact, most modern lunar surface mission planning is based on solar power and batteries and typically avoids the challenges associated with surviving the full lunar cycle or shadowed regions.
While interest in lunar science and the development of abilities to deliver payloads to the lunar surface are resurgent, the capability to operate through the entire lunar environment is critical. In the absence of perpetual power supplies like RTG’s, thermal management approaches to accommodate the lunar extremes, extended day/night cycles, and shadowed regions are seen as enabling.
","SMD lunar surface science investigations will employ small, low power payloads that will require advanced thermal control approaches and techniques to survive and operate for extended duration through extreme thermal environments on the lunar surface.
NASA has plans to purchase services for delivery of payloads to the Moon through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contract. Under this subtopic, proposals may include efforts to develop payloads for flight demonstration of relevant technologies in the lunar environment. The CLPS payload accommodations will vary depending on the particular service provider and mission characteristics. Additional information on the CLPS program and providers can be found at this link: https://www.nasa.gov/content/commercial-lunar-payload-services. CLPS missions will typically carry multiple payloads for multiple customers. Smaller, simpler, and more self-sufficient payloads are more easily accommodated and would be more likely to be considered for a NASA-sponsored flight opportunity. Commercial payload delivery services may begin as early as 2020 and flight opportunities are expected to continue well into the future. In future years it is expected that larger and more complex payloads will be accommodated. Selection for award under this solicitation will not guarantee selection for a lunar flight opportunity.

A stretch goal of compatibility with other working fluids is acceptable. Proposed technologies must address all of the following design goals:
Condensing radiators with passive, variable heat rejection turn-down capability of greater than 200:1 achieved through partial to complete coolant freezing and built-in flow bypass Compatible with a segmented radiator design where panels are one-time deployable Mass goal of < 8 kg/m^2 including fluid and deployable hardware Scalable design up to 3 m^2 consisting of 1 m^2 panels Materials and structures should be compatible with 15-year life in environments ranging from low Lunar orbit, Jupiter orbit (radiation exposure), and inner to outer planet exploration (temperature exposures) Working pressures and freeze-tolerance turn-down technologies should assume ammonia as the working fluid
Passive Three-Way Valves:
NASA seeks novel three-way valves that can operate as either a mixing valve (two liquid input ports and one liquid output port) or splitting valve (one liquid input port and two liquid output ports) that can be used to passively control loop temperatures by the degree fraction of radiator bypass. Such miniature passive thermal control valves could find use in a number of single-phase mechanically pumped fluid thermal control systems. Proposed technologies must address the following design goals:
Design shall autonomously operate without power <0.1% flow rate through the shut off port, with a goal of having a provision for no leakage/adjustable leakage through the use of a pre-installed orifice Control range of 5-10 oC, with pre-adjustable set-point control Operational temperature limits -55 oC to 90 oC, non-operational limits of -55 oC to125 oC Designs shall be compatible with FC-72 working fluid as well as those used on the ISS thermal control loops (water and ammonia).Retrofit of soft goods are acceptable. Mass desire <250 grams (maximum mass 500 g) Unit volume <50 cm3 (maximum 100 cm3) Leak rate 1x10-6 scc/s gHe at 200 PSIA Minimum 4000 full actuation cycles, desired 17,500 cycles Rad hard to 300 krad 200 psia maximum expected operating pressure, 200 psia proof pressure, 800 psia burst pressure Pressure drop <1.5 psi at 1.5 liters per minute of FC-72 working fluid
Global Access Lunar Technology Development:
NASA is seeking focused efforts to develop large human class lunar lander technologies. Technologies should address a gap associated to long duration habitation on the lunar surface where temperatures range from -193° C in shadow regions (including night) to 120° C at the subsolar point. System technologies should be orientation insensitive; for example, lander side mounted radiators must provide their function regardless of lunar surface temperature condition. Technologies are needed that allow a single vehicle design to operate in all these environments. Technologies should address reduction in mass, volume, and power usage relative to current solutions. Adding heaters can add significant vehicle mass to accommodate an additional power source and are not considered a novel architecture approach. Proposed radiator technologies should also address Micrometeoroid and Orbital Debris (MMOD) robustness and protection potential where appropriate.
Examples of other challenges to address in this area include: the deposition of dust on radiators leading to degraded optical properties, contamination insensitive evaporators/sublimators to enable long mission life, and self-healing coolant tubes for MMOD impact resilience.
Technologies should be suitable for use in medium sized landers that operate near 1 kW average heat dissipation capacity. Proposed technologies should also be extensible to human class landers that will have variable heat loads, and average loads between 3-6 kW. All technologies should support a minimum flight duration of 5 years and be compatible with the encountered aerospace environment.
This subtopic is different from S3.06 subtopic, which is focused on thermal control technologies for payloads and smaller robotic landers.
Human Thermal Modeling:
Human thermal analysis for space applications has primarily focused on Extravehicular Activity (EVAs), and typically utilized standalone tools for these short duration assessments. As NASA moves beyond low earth orbit to long duration missions, crew member induced loads to an exploration vehicle’s thermal control, environmental control, and life support systems need conjugate analytical assessments between crew and vehicle to determine the most mass efficient capacity for these systems. Additionally, these missions will require an exercise prescription at high metabolic rates for the crew which drives the system sizing for CO2, water (vapor and liquid), and metabolic heat removal. The provided human thermal model should be capable of interfacing with Systems Improved Numerical Differencing Analyzer (SINDA) compatible analysis tools to enable conjugate assessments of crew-induced loads and vehicle thermal control systems.
NASA has plans to purchase services for delivery of payloads to the Moon through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contract. Under this subtopic, proposals may include efforts to develop payloads for flight demonstration of relevant technologies in the lunar environment. The CLPS payload accommodations will vary depending on the particular service provider and mission characteristics. Additional information on the CLPS program and providers can be found at this link: https://www.nasa.gov/content/commercial-lunar-payload-services. CLPS missions will typically carry multiple payloads for multiple customers. Smaller, simpler, and more self-sufficient payloads are more easily accommodated and would be more likely to be considered for a NASA-sponsored flight opportunity. Commercial payload delivery services may begin as early as 2020 and flight opportunities are expected to continue well into the future. In future years it is expected that larger and more complex payloads will be accommodated. Selection for award under this solicitation will not guarantee selection for a lunar flight opportunity.
",3 to 5,"Prototype, Analysis, Hardware, Software
","Phase I awards are expected to provide a proof-of-concept analysis and supporting hardware/software which demonstrates the ability of the organization to meet the goals stated in the solicitation.
At the culmination of a Phase II contract, deliverables would include math modeling that has been correlated to test data, raw and reduced test data, and delivery of the new hardware or software package to NASA.
","These focus areas strive to reduce mass, volume, and power of a thermal control system in the next generation of robotic and human class spacecrafts. These improvements may come through either novel hardware solutions or modernization of software tools used to assess human vehicle interactions. The current state-of-the-art (SOA) in thermal control results in vehicle power and mass impact of greater than 25-30% due to old technologies still in use. Furthermore, as missions become more variable (dormancy, environments, etc.) the need for intelligent control (both actively and passively) within the thermal control system becomes more apparent. As science payloads continue to decrease in size, increase in power, and require precise temperature control, all of which cannot be provided by traditional thermal control methods due to vehicle level impacts of mass/volume and power.

Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,A1.01Aeroelasticity and Aeroservoelastic Control,"Aeroelasticity and Aeroservoelasticity for Advanced Configurations
","The technical discipline of aeroelasticity is a critical ingredient necessary in the design process of a flight vehicle for maintaining optimal performance while ensuring freedom from aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic instabilities. This discipline requires a thorough understanding of the complex interactions between a flexible structure and the steady and unsteady aerodynamic forces acting on the structure, with interactive control systems for flight vehicle performance and stability. Predicting the aeroelastic response of emerging evolutionary and revolutionary vehicle concepts, which include new vehicle configurations, new structures, and/or new materials, is not an easy task. Aeroelastic prediction and testing methods must evolve and expand together with these vehicle concepts. The use of lightweight flexible structures, the development of new airframes, and the intentional exploitation of aeroelastic response phenomena require a comprehensive understanding of the aeroelasticity involved if they are to succeed. Both enhancements to current methodologies/codes and new methodologies/codes that enable evaluation and understanding of new concepts are needed to keep pace with the state of the art in vehicle technology and to fill critical gaps in understanding these complex vehicles.
The fundamental aeronautics work for the Aeroelasticity and Aeroservoelastic Control Subtopic is focused on active/adaptive aerostructural control for lightweight flexible structures, specifically related to load distribution, flutter prediction and suppression, gust load prediction and alleviation, and aeroservoelasticity for Ultra-Efficient and Supersonic Commercial Vehicles. The program's work on aeroservoelasticity includes conduct of broad-based research and technology development to obtain a fundamental understanding of aeroelastic and unsteady-aerodynamic phenomena experienced by aerospace vehicles in subsonic, transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic speed regimes. The subtopic content includes theoretical aeroelasticity, experimental aeroelasticity, and advanced aeroservoelastic concepts. Of interest are:

Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,A1.02Quiet Performance - Aircraft Propulsion Noise,,"Innovative methods and technologies are necessary for the design and development of efficient, environmentally acceptable aircraft. In particular, for passenger aircraft, the impact of aircraft noise on communities around airports is the predominant limiting factor on the growth of the nation's air transportation system. Reductions in aircraft noise could lead to wider community acceptance, lower airline operating costs where noise quotas/fees are employed, and increased potential for air traffic growth on a global scale.
Therefore, in support of the Advanced Air Vehicles Program (AAVP), Integrated Aviation Systems Program (IASP), and Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program (TACP), improvements in technologies and methods for aircraft propulsion noise prediction, diagnostics, and reduction for both subsonic and supersonic aircraft are sought. Innovations in the following specific areas are solicited:
Noise Reduction
Advanced liners including broadband liners (i.e., liners capable of appreciable sound absorption over at least two octaves) and low-frequency liners (i.e., liners with optimum absorption frequencies half of the current ones but without increasing liner depth); engine hot-section liners; Low-noise propulsor concepts that are significantly quieter than the current generation fans and open rotors; Concepts for active control of propulsion broadband noise sources including fan, open rotor, jet, compressor, combustor, and turbine; Adaptive flow and noise control technologies including smart structures and materials for inlets, nozzles, and low-drag liners; Concepts to mitigate the effects of distorted inflow on propulsor noise;
Noise Prediction
High-fidelity fan and turbine noise prediction models including Large Eddy Simulation of broadband noise, 3D fan and turbine acoustic transmission models for tone and broadband noise; Accurate models for prediction of installed noise for jet surface interaction, fan inlet distortion, and open rotors;
Noise Diagnostics
Tools/Technologies for quantitative characterization of fan in-duct broadband noise in terms of its spatial and temporal content; Phased array and acoustical holography techniques to measure realistic propulsion noise sources in low-signal-to-noise ratio wind tunnel environments; Characterization of fundamental jet noise sources and structures; Innovative measurement of radiated acoustic fields from aeroacoustic sources; Novel and robust combustion noise measurement techniques.
",2 to 5.,"Prototype, Analysis, Hardware, Software, Research
","Concepts and technologies that demonstrate a potential for engine component noise reduction, or demonstrate characteristics that could be incorporated into a more sophisticated noise control solution for aircraft engines.
","Current state-of-the-art solutions for propulsion noise reduction rely heavily on relatively modest changes to the engine architecture and/or passive noise reduction technologies such as acoustic liners, blade/vane count optimization, or vane sweep and/or lean. They do not incorporate advanced materials, adaptive mechanisms, or active noise control systems that can modify the acoustic performance of the component(s) of interest based on the noise state of the engine or aircraft. Such materials, mechanisms, and systems are currently at various stages of maturity, but in general they have not been sufficiently developed to meet certifiability, reliability, and robustness criteria. Novel material systems that could be applied to engine component noise sources are needed, such as shape memory alloy actuators, or active or adaptive systems. High-fidelity numerical tools are beginning to be used for predicting engine component noise. However, they remain too resource-intensive for routine use for design and analysis work. Medium-fidelity prediction tools that can be used for rapid-turn-around evaluations at design and analysis stages are highly desirable. Advanced flow and noise diagnostic techniques that can provide more direct linkage between the noise generating flow features and/or provide more detailed spatio-temporal descriptions of the sound field are also much needed.
","AAVP: The Advanced Air Transport Technology (AATT) and Commercial Supersonic Technology (CST) Projects would benefit from noise reduction technologies that could reduce the aircraft noise footprint at landing and takeoff. Configurations with novel engine placement, such as above the fuselage, can reduce the noise footprint, but technologies are needed to efficiently model the performance and noise impacts of these novel engine installations.
TACP: The Transformational Tools and Technologies (TTT) Project would benefit from tool developments to enhance the ability to consider acoustics earlier in the aircraft design process. The TTT project would also benefit from the development and demonstration of simple material systems, such as advanced liner concepts with reduced drag or adaptive material and/or structures that reduce noise, as these component technologies could have application in numerous vehicle classes in the AAVP portfolio, including subsonic and supersonic transports as well as vertical lift vehicles.

Achieving low emissions and finding new pathways to cleaner power are critical for the development of future air vehicles.

Future vehicles will be more fuel-efficient which will result in smaller engine cores operating at higher pressures. Future combustors will also likely employ lean burn concepts which are more susceptible to combustion instabilities.

Turbo-electric, hybrid electric, and all electric power generation, as well as distributed propulsive power, have been identified as candidate transformative aircraft configurations with reduced fuel consumption/energy use and emissions. However, components and management methods for power generation, distribution, and conversion are not currently available in the high power ranges with the necessary efficiency, power density, electrical stability and safety required for thin haul/short haul, or transport-class aircraft. Novel developments are sought in:

","The critical technical need is for lightweight, high-efficiency power distribution systems and energy storage that have flight-critical reliability. Typically, the weight needs to be reduced by a factor of 2-3 and efficiency needs to be improved. Higher efficiency reduces losses and makes thermal management more achievable in an aircraft. Another need for medium to large aircraft is the ability to operate at voltages above 600V. This capability results in reduced weight, however, is called out specifically because it impacts all of the power system components.

Additionally, NASA is formulating a MW-level EAP flight demo this year.
Key Outcomes NASA intends to achieve in this area are:
Outcome for 2015-2025: markets will begin to open for electrified small aircraft. Outcome for 2025-2035: certified small aircraft fleets enabled by electrified aircraft propulsion will provide new mobility options. The decade may also see initial application of electrified aircraft propulsion on large aircraft.

Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,A1.05Computational Tools and Methods,,"Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) plays an important role in the design and development of a vast array of aerospace vehicles, from commercial transports to space systems. With the ever-increasing computational power, usage of higher fidelity, fast CFD tools and processes will significantly improve the aerodynamic performance of airframe and propulsion systems, as well as greatly reduce non-recurring costs associated with ground-based and flight testing. Historically, the growth of CFD accuracy has allowed NASA and other organizations, including commercial companies, to reduce wind tunnel and single-engine component tests. Going forward, increased CFD fidelity for complete vehicle or engine configurations holds the promise of significantly reducing development costs by enabling certification by analysis. Confidence in fast, accurate CFD allows engineers to reach out of their existing design space and accelerate technology maturation schedules. NASA’s CFD Vision 2030 Study (https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140003093.pdf) highlighted the many shortcomings in the existing computational technologies used for conducting high-fidelity simulations and made specific recommendations for investments necessary to overcome these challenges.
One area of research is scale-resolving numerical simulations, which are playing an increasing role in CFD analysis of new and existing aerodynamic configurations at off-design conditions. It is well-known that traditional steady-state Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) analysis performs poorly in separated boundary layers and shear layers. Time-accurate Wall-Modeled Large Eddy Simulation (WMLES) and hybrid RANS-LES have demonstrated increased accuracy for a subset of these flows where large scale fluctuations are computationally resolved while the near-wall small scale fluctuations are modeled. Since RANS can accurately compute attached flow regions, it is desirable from a computational cost perspective to initiate scale resolving simulations just upstream of the separated flow regions. However, unsteady disturbances must be added to kick-start scale resolving simulations but an accurate and robust approach to accomplish that is lacking. The goal of this solicitation is to overcome this deficiency. One approach is to insert synthetic turbulent eddies at the start of the scale-resolving flow domain to effectively “trip” the flow. Several methods have been reported in the literature to generate these turbulent fluctuations, but these are not general enough to apply to realistic aircraft configurations, do not evolve into resolved physical turbulent structures in a reasonable amount of time/space, or cause large acoustic fluctuations rendering them inapplicable to aero-acoustic analysis.
An ideal turbulence generator for embedded scale-resolving simulations targeting hybrid RANS-LES and wall-modeled LES would satisfy the following criteria:
Easy to implement/apply to general aircraft/rockets configurations locally embedded within a larger CFD domain Use existing upstream RANS data (e.g., using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model), such as velocity profile and estimated Reynolds stresses, and little to nothing else in terms of user parameters Develop into realistic turbulence under 10-15 boundary layer thickness from the plane (or volume) where it is applied (based on first order statistics and two-point correlations) Require little to no change to an existing scale-resolving flow solver independent of grid paradigm (unstructured, structured overset, or Cartesian) Properly handle the inner region of hybrid RANS-LES and WMLES simulations leading to fast skin friction recovery within 10-15 boundary layer thickness Create negligible acoustic fluctuations (i.e., smaller than magnitude of attached wall-bounded turbulence)
What is being solicited is a “plug and play” software module that could be easily inserted in an independent CFD solver (e.g., a NASA code) to provide necessary input for scale resolving simulations. The awardee will demonstrate the software tool for carefully selected relevant test cases, before delivering it to NASA.
",3 to 6,"Analysis, Software, Research
","The deliverable will be a software tool that could be used in conjunction with computational fluid dynamic solvers to perform scale resolving simulations that are relevant to NASA missions, particularly the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) where this capability is needed for flow control applications, aircraft maximum lift prediction and certification by analysis. The awardee will demonstrate the developed computational tool on relevant aerodynamic configurations before delivering it to NASA.
","NASA's CFD Vision 2030 Study identified several impediments in computational technologies and this solicitation addresses one of those related to application of scale resolving simulations needed for expanding the scope of application of CFD across the aircraft flight envelope, particularly in the prediction of maximum lift.
","Various programs and projects of NASA missions use computational fluid dynamics for advanced aircraft concepts, launch vehicle design and planetary entry vehicles. The developed technology will enable design decisions by ARMD and Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD).

Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,A1.06Vertical Lift Technology and Urban Air Mobility,"Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Ride Quality
","Urban air mobility (UAM) is a concept for air transportation around metropolitan areas consisting of passenger-carrying operations. An emerging UAM market will require a high density of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) operations for on-demand, affordable, quiet and fast transportation in a scalable and conveniently-accessible “vertiport” network. UAM is envisioned to provide increased mobility within a given metropolitan area by traveling faster, and using shorter and more direct routing as compared to ground vehicles.
The expanding UAM vehicle industry has generated a significant level of enthusiasm among aviation designers and manufacturers, resulting in numerous vehicle configurations. The majority of the prototype UAM vehicles have more than 4 rotors or propellers, have electric propulsion, carry 2-6 passengers, fly more like a helicopter (vertical take-off and landing) than a fixed-wing aircraft and will fly relatively close to the ground and near buildings. There are many unknowns as to how the industry will mature but technical barriers may be secondary to the challenge of attracting passengers to fly in these new aircraft that are unconventional in appearance and operations.
A critical challenge for UAM market growth is to gain public acceptance that UAM VTOL aircraft are: 1) as safe, or safer than, commercial air travel and automotive transportation, and 2) as comfortable as conventional modes of transportation.
The solicitation will address likely obstacles to passenger acceptance of UAM vehicles. Passenger acceptance concerns include feeling safe, vehicle motion, noise and vibration, availability and access, passenger well-being, concern for the environment and others. Some of these concerns are highlighted in Ref. 1, and in a recent study funded by NASA (Ref. 2) below.
Phase I of the SBIR should review these passenger acceptance concerns and propose mitigation strategies.
Phase II of the SBIR should include development and demonstration of strategies for improving the passenger experience for VTOL UAM vehicles.
",2 to 4,"Prototype, Analysis, Research
","Strategies that address the safety and comfort expectations of UAM vehicle passengers.
","There are approximately 150 UAM vehicle concepts in varying stages of development. The immediate focus of the vehicle developers is overcoming obstacles on the path to certification. The public has experience flying in large transport aircraft and ground transportation (cars, trains, buses) and are calibrated to the comfort levels (motion, noise, vibration, air conditioning, heating, lighting, etc.) associated with these modes of transportation. Multirotor UAM vehicles will fly more like a helicopter and as a consequence, will likely have more or different motion, vibration and noise transmitted into the cabin. For UAM aircraft, research is needed that 1) addresses the safety and comfort expectations of the passengers and crew, and 2) provides vehicle design strategies for improving passenger comfort.
","This subtopic is relevant to the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology (RVLT) Project under the Advanced Air Vehicle Program. The goal of the RVLT Project is to develop and validate tools, technologies and concepts to overcome key barriers for vertical lift vehicles. The scope encompasses technologies that address noise, speed, mobility, payload, efficiency, environment and safety for both conventional and non-conventional vertical lift configurations. This subtopic directly aligns with the mission, goals and scope in addressing safety of non-conventional vertical lift configurations.

Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,A1.07Propulsion Efficiency - Turbomachinery Technology for High Power Density Turbine-Engines,,"NASA is looking for improvement in aeropropulsive power density and efficiency in support of its Strategic Thrust in the area of Ultra-Efficient Subsonic Transports. Focus is on small core turbofan engines for next-generation and future large commercial transport aircraft, conventional as well as electrified. The subtopic is closely aligned with NASA Aeronautics programs in the areas of Compact Gas Turbine (CGT) and Electrified Aircraft Propulsion (EAP), and will augment the corresponding Advanced Air Transport Technology (AATT) Project's Technical Challenges. Technical Challenges are targeted technology development areas. Main areas of interest include: Improved efficiency of small core engines, integrated thermal management, innovative cycles, use of artificial intelligence (AI) for turbomachinery components design and optimization, and efficient turbomachinery for EAP, including large electric power extraction in serial-hybrid electrified aircraft and efficient turbine-engines for power generation. The improvements will help airlines to reduce costs by reduced fuel burn. Future electrified airplanes that rely on turbine engines as their energy sources will also be able to maximize their advantages over conventional propulsion.
The detailed areas solicited and the corresponding specific technologies sought include:
Small-core engines efficiency improvements: Desensitizing performance to losses due to tip leakage, secondary flows, seals, purge flows and cooling air Compact transition ducts Active and passive flow control for improved airfoil performance and reduce tip clearance losses Innovative turbine shrouding to circumvent tip clearancesloss generationTurbofan thermal management: Compact thermal management systems using multi-functional structures and additive manufacturing Integrated thermal management of turbofan-electric components for more-electric and hybrid-electric aircraft Turbine high effectiveness cooling and loss reduction Innovative aviation-weight compact heat exchangers for cooling the cooling air and associated heat recovery or rejectionOptimized integrated combustor – turbine systems: Integration concepts of combustor and turbine for improved overall and component performanceInnovative methods for turbomachinery design and aerothermal analysis Automating design of turbomachinery components using AI Automated turbomachinery computational fluid dynamics (CFD) grid generation using AI CFD models for turbomachinery unsteady flows including transition and separation for accurate loss prediction Components performance maps generation using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) Use of additive manufacturing to enable designs and improvements not possible with conventional manufacturing processes Remote non-contact dynamic temperature mapping in the presence of significant radiative background. Surface temperature mapping tools including efficient image processing algorithms are sought that will be compatible with silicon carbide based components with or without low thermal expansion oxide environmental barrier coating Capability of fast full-wheel, unsteady, multi-stage, CFD for compressor and turbine components for aerothermal analysisInnovative engine cycles as improvements alternatives to conventional engines Closed cycles for thermal management and primary propulsion (e.g., supercritical CO2 Brayton cycles, organic fluid Rankine cycles, etc.) Turbofan waste heat recovery and utilizationEfficient and light-weight turbomachinery for EAP and More Electric Aircraft Turbomachinery for high power extraction from turbofans. The desire is to enable larger than 20% of low pressure spool power at altitude cruise to be extracted as shaft power. The power is to electric generator(s) to provide power to electric motor-driven propulsors (example: STARC-ABL concept). Design of turbomachinery components and optimization of extraction from low- and high-pressure spools is sought. Efficiency improvements of small turboshaft engines powering turbo-generators/range-extenders used in regional EAP aircraft concepts. Small turboshafts suffer from low efficiency, and design of high effectiveness aviation-weight improvements are sought. Ideas to consider include recuperation using light-weight heat exchangers and concepts employing multifunctional and additive manufacturing approaches.
",1 to 4,"Prototype, Analysis, Hardware, Software, Research
","The objective of this subtopic solicitation is to develop technologies that contribute to increasing the power density of future turbofan engines. The deliverables of Phase I will be feasibility assessment of innovative ideas in the form of results of numerical studies, software tools, results of experiments, or tests of demonstration prototypes. Projects showing successful feasibility may be selected for further development under Phase II.
The scope of turbomachinery includes the rotating machinery in the high and low pressure spools, transition ducts, purge and bleed flows, casing and hub. It also includes turbomachinery aspects of EAP concepts where a turbine engine is the power source. The latter includes hybrid-electric turbofan power extraction and efficiency improvements of small turbine engine powering turbogenerator/ range-extenders. This topic address only aerothermal aspects of turbomachinery. Materials, controls and other areas are not included in this subtopic and may be solicited under separate subtopics.
This solicitation's desire is to focus on the turbofan engine core, but unique novel ideas relevant to the whole engine are also sought.
","System and technology studies have indicated that advanced gas turbine propulsion will remain critical for next-generation and future subsonic transports.
The main interest of this solicitation is in turbofan engines. Turbofans will be relevant for next-generation and future conventionally powered aircraft. They will also be relevant as power sources of future electrified airplanes.
Impressive advancements were made in turbofan technologies that increased their efficiency and performance. Most recent upcoming near term technologies being incorporated in engines as the GE9X and Rolls Royce SuperFan intend to include overall pressure-ratio (OPR) of 60, large diameter fans with low blade count and low fan pressure-ratio, bypass ratio of order 11, advanced booster designs, highly 3D airfoil designs, high compressor pressure ratio in the range of 27, application of CMC (Carbon Matrix Composites) materials in hot sections and more. Despite these advances, there is potential for additional improvements; they are possible and needed for future aircraft architecture and concepts.
In the turbine, the very high cycle temperatures demanded by advanced engine cycles place a premium on the cooling technologies required to ensure adequate life of the turbine component. New capabilities as well as challenges are provided with expected increased use of ceramic matrix composites (CMC). Presently, engines are overcooled because of uncertainty in hot section flow uniformity caused by hot streaks. Reduced cooling flow rates and/or increased cycle temperatures enabled by these technologies have a dramatic impact on the engine performance.
In the compression system, advanced concepts and technologies are required to increase stage loading and widen operating range. Interrelated to the turbine, the cooling flow presently result in high penalty caused by the typical 20% bleed air ratio; the goal is to reduce it to 5%. OPR may be increased to the order of 100. As result the overall thermal efficiency can be increased by 10-15%. Aerothermal improvements not only will improve performance, but also will lead to reduced weight and increase the core specific power.
Engines are currently designed in a time-consuming iterative manner taking several months for a complete system. AI and ML approaches are expected to speed up the process and lead to optimized designs maximizing the efficiency and power density and take it down to a matter of hours and days.
NASA and industry are actively working on electrified aircraft concepts. Many of these concepts employ turbine-engines as power sources. The impact on the turbomachinery requirement and design needs to be addressed, which, in turn, will impact the viability of the EAP concepts.
Finally, innovative methods for engine waste heat recovery and re-utilization will increase the effective engine efficiency. And alternatives to the conventional open Brayton cycle may also lead to revolutionary propulsion system, or at least to improvements of existing systems.
","The solicited topics are directly relevant to NASA’ Aeronautics project goals in the area of high power density cores - to lead to realizing revolutionary improvements in economics and environmental performance for subsonic transports with opportunities to transition to alternative propulsion and energy.

Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,A1.09Inflight Icing Hazard Mitigation Technology,Sensing and Mitigation of Icing Conditions,"All-weather sensing and mitigation is a future challenge for electric vehicles, both electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) operating in the urban air mobility (UAM) mission and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in current and future mission profiles. The primary focus is on icing but other weather hazards including wind, reduced visibility, lightning and degradation of Global Positioning System (GPS) may also be addressed. Characterize the conditions which create ice accretions on a UAS and/or eVTOL (either a class or a specific aircraft) across the anticipated operational envelope, and analyze the ice shapes using simulation tools and ground test methods. Map performance degradation to atmospheric conditions obtained from flight test and/or atmospheric simulations. In-situ characterization of icing conditions using existing or new instruments or techniques must address the weight and power constraints expected for a class or specific vehicle. Ground-based remote sensing of icing conditions must be suitable for various vertiport sites, based on commercial instruments and/or data services.
",3 to 5.,"Prototype, Analysis
","Deliverables may include some or all of the following: design or prototype of a multi-sensor suite for weather hazard identification, characterization of expected icing conditions along with associated performance degradation, and/or novel algorithms for identification of weather hazards.
","All-weather operations are important for vertical lift air vehicles, which have missions that require operating in weather at altitude. Formation of ice over lifting surfaces can affect aerodynamic performance.
Detection and avoidance of icing is a key technology for acceptance and certification, for both manned and unmanned vehicles. Unplanned icing incidents have already occurred involving unmanned aerial systems undertaking current missions. Icing detection requires a broad database of icing encounters for validation. This requires a significant campaign of testing in icing wind tunnels and in flight.
Atmospheric characterization is another key part of detection and avoidance. A vehicle must not only detect that it is in icing but also quantify the severity of the icing and any decision that must be made in a timely manner. Remote sensing methods, whether from a terminal area sensor or from a forward-looking sensor on the vehicle, are not currently capable of meeting these requirements. Current aviation weather research mostly involves either ground-level or cruise altitudes, since this is where current commercial aviation operation takes place. However, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and eVTOLs may operate at low altitudes (within a few hundred feet altitude), where complex meteorological events can occur that are not well represented in prior weather research.
","All-weather sensing and mitigation is a particular challenge for electric vehicles, both eVTOL operating in the UAM mission and UAVs operating in current and future mission profiles. Mitigation through detection and avoidance is especially critical for systems which already have stringent power and weight requirements.

Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,A1.10Hypersonic/High Speed Technology - Seals and Thermal Barriers,"Development of High Temperature, Wear-Resistant Coatings for Seals and Thermal Barriers","Future high speed vehicles will require high temperature, dynamic seals and thermal barriers around movable surfaces to minimize the ingestion of hot gases through sealed interfaces and protect underlying temperature-sensitive structures. Locations include around the edges and along the hinge lines of movable control surfaces (e.g., flaps, rudders), panels, and doors. The seals must operate in high heat flux, oxidizing environments and restrict the flow of hot gases at temperatures on the order of 2000° F. They must be flexible enough to accommodate distorted sealing surfaces while remaining in contact with them to create an effective seal. In some locations, they may also have to limit applied loads against sealing surfaces that are fragile or covered with delicate protective coatings. The seals must also be sufficiently durable to meet required life goals. They must resist damage as they are rubbed over rough, distorted sealing surfaces without incurring excessive increases in leakage due to wear. In some locations the seals may have to seal against rough thermal protection system (TPS) materials without sticking to their surfaces. Previous testing has shown that coatings on flexible fabrics can potentially improve seal durability. The objective of this opportunity is to identify and/or develop high temperature, wear-resistant coatings for seals and thermal barriers and evaluate their durability under representative operating conditions.

","Deliverables include development, production, demonstration and evaluation of high temperature, wear-resistant coatings for seals and thermal barriers with key demonstrations/evaluations of their durability under representative operating conditions.
","State-of-the-art seals and thermal barriers are often fabricated out of flexible, high-temperature ceramic fibers and fabrics to help minimize seal compression loads and to allow them to accommodate variable gap geometries and distorted sealing surfaces. However, these materials can become damaged when they are rubbed against adjacent sealing surfaces, especially in dynamic applications. This can lead to higher leak rates and increases in temperature near critical components thereby requiring the seals to be replaced, often after a limited number of missions.

The objective of this opportunity is to identify and/or develop a high temperature elastomer that can be formed (e.g., molded, extruded) into various seal geometries for use at temperatures of 700°F or greater.

","Low leakage seals such as O-rings are often made of elastomers because these materials exhibit little plastic flow and rapid, nearly complete recovery from an extending or compressing force. However, even the most heat-resistant elastomers have maximum continuous use temperature limits of about 600°F.

Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,T15.03Electrified Aircraft Propulsion Energy Storage,,"Proposals are sought for the development of enabling rechargeable batteries (or other types of energy storage) for Electrified Aircraft Propulsion (EAP).
Two paths to improved battery performance are sought:
Innovative thermal, structural, and electrical integration that reduce the mass fraction added when scaling from a battery cell to an integrated battery Battery chemistry improvements that substantially enhance usable energy density, cycle life, life cycle cost, and safety
Batteries and other energy storage systems with some combination of some or all of the following performance levels at the integrated battery pack level are sought:
Specific energy >400Whr/kg at the system level Cycle life >10,000 cycles Prime flight quality and safety Cost effective enough to close electric air services at a profit
Battery pack level energy density means the amount of usable energy after derating for depth of discharge, cycle life, C rate limits, thermal constraints, and any other applicable limit to energy that can be used during the mission divided by the mass of the battery package (including the structure, safety devices, battery management system, and thermal management parts that are mounted to the battery). This will typically require cell level energy densities in the range to 600-800 W-hr/kg along with an innovative combination of those cells into a battery system. Alternate electrical energy storage approaches will also be considered.
All-electric conventional and vertical takeoff research vehicles that can carry one or two people have been demonstrated. In order to achieve commercial viability, improvements in batteries are required for the aircraft to have sufficient range, safety, and operational economics for regular service. Markets needs span Urban Air Mobility (UAM), thin/short haul aviation, and commercial air transport vehicles which use electrified aircraft propulsion. Hybrid electric and all electric power generation as well as distributed propulsive power have been identified as candidate transformative aircraft configurations with reduced fuel consumption/energy use and emissions.
",2 to 6,"Prototype, Analysis, Hardware, Research
","Deliverables most likely will include prototypes of energy storage units along with research and analysis addressing safety and cost considerations. In some cases test data for safety may be a deliverable. Ideally, proposals would identify a technology pull area (with a market size estimate), how the proposed idea addresses the needs of the technology pull area, and then deliver a combination of analysis and prototypes that substantiate the idea's merit.
Please consider SBIR subtopic A1.04 - Electrified Aircraft Propulsion if you are considering energy storage technologies appropriate for near term applications that will have a higher TRL (3-5) at completion.
","Specific Energy: Need approximately a factor of 2 improvement. Current assessment of battery specific energy requirements for all-electric operations are in the 300-400 Wh/kg at the installed/pack level (Installed means after derating for depth of discharge limit, cycle life, battery management, packaging, and thermal environment). This assumes the ability to quickly recharge between flights. Current state of the art (SOA) is about ≈ 160-170 Wh/kg (pack level). Li-ion batteries are nearing practical maximums so new chemistry(s) or energy storage types are likely required to meet all-electric UAM mission needs, solid state appears to be the most promising. For reference, automotive needs will likely be more than met with 300-500 Wh/kg (cell level), but, with regards to NASA goals, all electric helicopters and regional passenger aircraft will likely need 600Wh/kg and 500-700Wh/kg (cell level) respectively. Note that approximately 30-40% Wh/kg is lost when cells are integrated into packs and installed; justify any improvements you expect.
Cycle Life: Need a substantial improvement. Current SOA is 1500-3000 cycles which lasts about 3 months for UAM. For reference, automotive needs 500-1000 cycles for 10 year lifespans.
Cost: Aviation is probably less sensitive to cost than automotive if the overall operations and vehicle concept can close profitably.
Prime Flight Quality: New feature that needs to be demonstrated. The expected reliability of an aviation system is probably a few orders of magnitude higher than an automotive application and safety considerations are a more significant driver – including time needed to get passengers out of danger. Justify how your concept may address these goals.
","Electrified Aircraft Propulsion (EAP) is an area of strong and growing interest in ARMD. Energy Storage is an enabling technology for the UAM and Thin Haul segments of the effort. There are emerging vehicle level efforts in Urban On-Demand Mobility, the X-57 electric airplane being built to demonstrate EAP advances applicable to thin and short haul aircraft markets, and an ongoing technology development subproject to enable EAP for single aisle aircraft. Additionally, NASA is formulating a megawatt-level EAP flight demo this year.
EAP is called out as a key part of Thrust 4 in the ARMD strategic plan.
Key Outcomes NASA intends to achieve in this area are:
Outcome for 2015-2025: Markets will begin to open for electrified small aircraft. Outcome for 2025-2035: Certified small aircraft fleets enabled by electrified aircraft propulsion will provide new mobility options. The decade may also see initial application of electrified aircraft propulsion on large aircraft. Outcome for >2035: The prevalence of small-aircraft fleets with electrified propulsion will provide improved economics, performance, safety, and environmental impact, while growth in fleet operations of large aircraft with cleaner, more efficient alternative propulsion systems will substantially contribute to carbon reduction.
Projects working in the vehicle aspects of EAP include: Advanced Air Vehicles Program (AAVP)/Advanced Air Transport Technology (AATT) Projects, Integrated Aviation Systems Program (IASP)/ Flight Demonstrations & Capabilities (FDC) Project, AAVP/Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology (RVLT) Project, and Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program (TACP)/Convergent Aeronautics Solutions (CAS) Projects.

Focus Area 19 Integrated Flight Systems,A2.02Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Technologies,Enabling Autonomy,"Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) offer significant advantages over manned aircraft for applications which are dangerous to humans, long in duration, requiring fast response and high degree of precision. Some examples include remote sensing, disaster response, delivery of goods, industrial inspection and agricultural support. Additionally, UAS may eventually be capable of safely transporting passengers, which can increase operational flexibility. The addition of autonomy to UAS enables more capability and promises greater economic and operational advantages. Some of these advantages include a higher degree of resilience to off-nominal conditions, the ability to adapt to dynamic situations and less reliance on humans during operations.
There are many barriers that are restricting greater use and application of autonomy in UAS. These barriers include, but are not limited to, the lack of methods, architectures and tools that enable:
The verification, validation and certification of complex and/or nondeterministic systems Sensing, perception, cognition and decision-making Cost-effective, resilient and self-organizing communications Improved survivability in degraded or off-nominal conditions
NASA and the aviation industry are involved in research that would greatly benefit from breakthroughs in UAS capabilities that could eventually enable the new Urban Air Mobility market. A few of the areas of research and missions are listed below.
Remote sensing missions utilizing one or more UAS would benefit from autonomous planning algorithms that can coordinate and execute a mission with minimal human oversight Detect and avoid algorithms, sensor fusion techniques, robust trajectory planners and contingency management systems that can enable Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and higher levels of UAS integration into the national airspace
This solicitation is intended to break through these and other barriers with innovative and high-risk research.
The Integrated Aviation Systems Program's work on UAS technology for the FY 2020 NASA SBIR solicitation is focused on tackling these barriers to enable greater use of UAS in NASA research, in civil aviation use and ultimately in the emerging UAM market. The following four research areas are the primary focus of this solicitation, but other closely related areas will also be considered for award. The primary research areas are:
Verification, Validation and Certification - New methods of verification, validation and certification need to be developed which enable application of complex systems to be certified for use in the National Airspace System (NAS). Proposed research could include novel hardware and/or software architectures that enable alternate or expedite traditional verification and validation requirements. Sensing, Perception, Cognition and Decision Making - Technologies need to be developed that provide the ability of UAS to detect and extract internal and external information of the vehicle, transform the raw data into information that can be understood by machines or humans, and recognize patterns and make decisions based on the data and patterns. Cost-effective, Resilient and Self-organizing Communications - Methods that ensure reliable, trusted-source communications with increasingly complex and interconnected systems are needed to minimize the impact of infrastructure outages (e.g. Global Positioning System (GPS) or ground station) and that are resilient against both internal and external cyber-physical attacks. Several key areas of interest are Resilient Position Navigation and Timing (RPNT) for GPS denied/degraded environments, mesh/self-organizing networks, and quantum communication technologies, in particular, quantum repeaters and quantum key distribution methods. Improved survivability in degraded or off-nominal conditions - Vehicle health monitoring techniques and contingency management algorithms that will mitigate risk to people and assets on the ground or in the air.
It is important to note that some technologies such as quantum communications can be utilized in many areas and it is recommended that the scope of such proposals be tailored to unmanned aircraft.

Focus Area 20 Airspace Operations and Safety,A3.03Future Aviation Systems Safety,,"Public benefits derived from continued growth in the transport of passengers and cargo are dependent on the improvement of the intrinsic safety attributes of the Nation’s and the world’s current and future air transportation system. Recent developments to address increasing demand are leading to greater system complexity, including airspace systems with tightly coupled air and ground functions as well as widely distributed and integrated aircraft systems. Current methods of ensuring that designs meet desired safety levels will likely not scale to these levels of complexity (Aeronautics R&D Plan, p. 30). The Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP) is addressing this challenge with a major area of focus on In-Time System-wide Safety Assurance (ISSA). A proactive approach to managing system safety requires (1) the ability to monitor the system continuously and to extract and fuse information from diverse data sources to identify emergent anomalous behaviors after new technologies, procedures, and training are introduced; and (2) the ability to reliably predict probabilities of the occurrence of hazardous events and of their safety risks.
Understanding and predicting system-wide safety concerns of the airspace system and the vehicles flying in it, as envisioned in future aviation systems is paramount. Such systems would include the emergent effects of increased use of automation and autonomy to enhance system capabilities, efficiency and performance beyond current, human-based systems, through health monitoring of system-wide functions that are integrated across distributed ground, air, and space systems. Emerging highly automated and even autonomous operations, such as those envisioned for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and urban air mobility (UAM) will play a major role in future airspace systems. In particular, operating beyond the operator’s visual line-of-sight (BVLOS) and near or over populated areas are topics of concern. Safety-critical risks include (1) flight outside of approved airspace, (2) unsafe proximity to people/property, (3) critical system failure (including loss of command and control (C2) link, loss or degraded GPS, loss of power, and engine failure); (4) loss-of-control (i.e., outside the envelope or flight control system failure).
Tools are being sought for use in creating prototypes of ISSA capabilities. The ultimate vision for ISSA is the delivery of a progression of capabilities that accelerate the detection, prognosis and resolution of system-wide threats.
Proposals under this subtopic are sought, but are not limited to, development and/or demonstration in the following areas (with an emphasis on safety applications):
Data collection architecture, data exchange model and data collection mechanism (for example via UTM TCL-4). Data mining tools and techniques to detect and identify anomalies and precursors to safety threats system-wide. Tools and techniques to assess and predict safety margins system-wide to assure airspace safety. Prognostic decision support tools and techniques capable of supporting real-time safety assurance. Verification and validation (V&V) tools and techniques for assuring the safety of air traffic applications during certification and throughout their lifecycles, and techniques for supporting the in-time monitoring of safety requirements during operation. Products to address technologies, simulation capabilities and procedures for reducing flight risk in areas of attitude and energy aircraft state awareness. Decision support tools and automation that will reduce safety risks on the airport surface for normal operations and during severe weather events. Alerting strategies/protocols/techniques that consider operational context, as well as operator state, traits and intent. Methodologies and tools for integrated prevention, mitigation and recovery plans with information uncertainty and system dynamics in a UAS and in a trajectory-based operations (TBO) environment. Strategies for optimal human-machine coordination for real-time hazard mitigation. Methods and technologies enabling transition from a dedicated pilot-in-command or operator for each aircraft (as required per current regulations) to single operators safely and efficiently managing multiple unmanned and UAM aircraft in civil operations.

Innovations in communications and navigation technologies for distributed small spacecraft are essential to fulfill the envisioned science missions within the decadal surveys and contribute to the success of human exploration missions. To construct the lunar communications architecture, it is appropriate to consider a hybrid approach of large and small satellite assets. Primary applications include data relay from lunar surface to surface, data relay to earth, and navigational aids to surface and orbiting users.

","Communications among spacecraft in the DSM configuration and between the DSM configuration and the Earth become more challenging beyond LEO distances. Collaborative configurations of widely distributed (10s to 100s km apart) small spacecraft (180 kg or less) will operate far into the near-Earth region of space and beyond into deep space, further stressing the already limited communications capabilities of small spacecraft. Alternative operational approaches with associated enabling hardware and/or software will be needed with the following:
DSM configuration control – distributed operations of the DSM configuration and of individual small spacecraft alternatives need to provide:science data time and location stamping; temporary data storage; distributed network control and data planes; networking protocols; and any other considerations associated with control of the configuration.Control needs to allow a swarm to fly with the precision approaching that of one large instrument, and/or produce relative position data that allows for compensation of measurements over time.

","Science measurements of DSMs are based on temporal and spatially distributed measurements where position knowledge and control are fundamental to the science interpretation. Current space navigation technologies are not adequate when relative or absolute position knowledge of multiple spacecraft are involved. Global navigation satellite services like the U.S. global positioning satellites (GPS) provide very limited services beyond GEO (Geocentric) distances and no practical services in deep space. Autonomous navigation capabilities are fundamental to DSMs to ensure known topography of the configuration at the time of data acquisition. Control of the distributed configuration requires robust absolute and relative position knowledge of each spacecraft within the configuration and the ability to control spacecraft position and movement according to mission needs.
Optical navigation - Solutions are sought for visual based systems that leverage advances in optical sensors (i.e., cameras, star trackers) to observe and track a target spacecraft and perform pose and relative position estimation. In particular, low SWaP absolute attitude determination using star tackers, etc. to achieve sub-arcsecond accuracy.JPL’s ASTERIA 6U CubeSat demonstrated pointing stability of 0.5 arcseconds (0.1 mo) RMS over 20 minutes using guide stars might represent the state-of-the-art. Opportunities for innovation include methods that do not require the execution of satellite maneuvers are/or the design of external satellite features that enhance observability. Innovations may be appropriate for only certain regimes, such as near, medium, or far range; however, this context should be described. Solutions for various mission operations concepts are of interest. Long-term, high accuracy attitude determination; in particular, low SWaP absolute attitude determination using star trackers, etc. to achieve sub-arcsecond accuracy. Other novel navigation methods - Stellar navigation aids, such as navigation via quasars, X-rays and pulsars, may provide enabling capabilities in deep space. Surface-based navigation aids, such as systems detecting radio beacons or landmarks, are invited. Methods for autonomous position control are also of interest. Technologies that accomplish autonomous relative orbit control among the spacecraft are invited. Control may be accomplished as part of an integrated system that includes one or more of the measurement techniques described above. Of particular interest are autonomous control solutions that do not require operator commanding for individual spacecraft. That is, control solutions should accept as input swarm-level constraints and parameters, and provide control for individual spacecraft. Opportunities for innovation include the application of optimization techniques that are feasible for small satellite platforms and do not assume particular orbit eccentricities.NOTE: Small spacecraft propulsion technologies are not included in this subtopic.
","Space communications and position knowledge and control are enabling capabilities required by spacecraft to conduct all NASA missions. The concept of Distributed Spacecraft Missions (DSM) involves the use of multiple spacecraft to achieve one or more science mission goals.

Provide coarse, non-propulsive de-orbit capability which can aid in the disposal of end-of-life spacecraft through burnup upon reentry. Provide an accurate means of de-orbiting by modulating the ballistic coefficient to guide the system to a desired point at the Von Karman altitude for precision reentry targeting.
Small, lightweight, deployable membranes have been tested and deployed in Earth for both solar sail and drag sail applications. NASA's 10 square meter NanoSail-D2 solar sail and The University of Surrey's InflateSail drag sail are two examples. These systems demonstrated the technical viability of developing a deployable drag device to accelerate the deorbit of satellites to comply with end-of-life regulations and to mitigate the growth of orbital debris. Given the underlining technology similarities between solar sail and drag sail systems there are opportunities for adaptation or cross-use of some system elements. Further, there is also opportunity for cross-use into other fields such as PowerSails, thin-film surface power generation, and thin-film thermal control systems.
In terms of controlled, targeted de-orbit, the NASA Exo-Brake development effort has yielded promising though nascent results with the development of controllable tension structures. Tension structures don't have the 'beam buckling' issue associated with the more common drag sails at the higher dynamic pressures at atmospheric entry interface. This approach, while not as applicable to larger disposal efforts, can allow for more targeted reentry with potential additional uses in inexpensive Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) test-beds or sample return concepts.
Developing systems to actively provide a de-orbit disposal, or targeted de-orbit/re-entry capability, is the next logical step toward such systems becoming widely available for spacecraft manufacturers, NASA and other government agencies as an alternative to conventional propulsion systems. Specific technology development areas of interest include:
Restowable concepts which can deploy, operate, then re-stow multiple times. This may include new boom and materials concepts, but must include a restowable/redeployable deployment architecture capable of meeting the de-orbit requirements below. Phase I proof of concept and preliminary design efforts that will lead to, or can be integrated into, environmental qualification and/or flight demonstration prototypes in a Phase II effort are of interest. Desired system-level capabilities include the de-orbit of CubeSats (3U to 12U or larger) and small spacecraft in the 50kg - 200kg mass range (frontal areas on the order of 2000 to 2700 cubic cm) from altitudes between approximately 700km and 2,000km in 25 years or less. Spacecraft flying below 700km will generally meet the 25-year-or-less requirement without augmentation.
",3 to 6,"Prototype, Analysis, and Hardware
","Ideal Phase II deliverable would be DragSail subsystems tested in a relevant environment
","State of the Art is currently being defined by the solar sail propulsion community whose interest is deploying similar large-area, lightweight sails to reflect photons and derive thrust. Technologies which support solar sail development are inherently similar to those that would be required to develop and implement DragSails. Thin-film membranes capable of being stored in a folded state for several years or decades, lightweight deployable and potentially retractable booms, and combinations thereof that can survive in Earth orbit environment (UV, atomic oxygen, ionizing radiation, etc.) that can deploy, augment a spacecraft's aerodynamic drag, and restow are of interest. Flight control systems for DragSails have yet to be demonstrated or tested and will be essential for DragSail systems that provide deorbit independently of other, proven, deorbit systems.
","Any spacecraft in Earth orbit must demonstrate how it will be either de-orbited or moved to an orbit that poses no risk to other spacecraft within a set period after its useful life. Therefore, any spacecraft launched by government, universities or industry are potential customers for a DragSail deorbit system. Further, the concepts developed as a part of the DragSail are applicable to large area solar sails, power sails, thin-film surface power, and the like.

Focus Area 21 Small Spacecraft Technologies,Z8.08Technologies to Enable Cost & Schedule Reductions for Ultra-Stable Normal Incidence Mirrors for CubeSats,,"Relatively inexpensive small spacecraft offer several advantages over larger, more expensive spacecraft small spacecraft can perform inspection and repair of larger spacecraft; several can be deployed for more frequent revisit rates over Earth's surface or planetary objects; and multiple craft can achieve affordable mission reliability through redundancy. To date, the utility of small spacecraft in missions involving remote sensing (in any spectral band) has been constrained by their low budget and compact size optical sensitivity is limited in proportion to the diameter of a telescope's aperture and magnification is limited by the effective focal length. The cost to produce one-of-a-kind optical assemblies is disproportionate and the production times too long to incorporate into the tight budgets and schedules typical of small spacecraft missions.",3 to 6,"Prototype
","Prototype telescope appropriate for inclusion in a 12U CubeSat with up to 8U available for optics. A CubeSat class precision optical system would include an aperture of up to approximately 0.2m diameter. For Phase I, deliverables should include a design reference mission relevant to the telescope design, with key performance parameters identified. Identification of key relevant subcomponents of a telescope system require a prototype demonstration for fabrication, test or control technology required for a successful Phase II delivery of a prototype. Ideally Phase I includes a reviewed preliminary design and manufacturing plan which demonstrates production feasibility, appropriate material behavior, process controls, optical performance, and mounting/deploying issues especially with considerations to small spacecraft should be resolved and demonstrated. While final manufacturing and assembly will be conducted in Phase II, the preliminary design should address how optical, mechanical (static and dynamic) and thermal designs and performance analysis will be done to show compliance with proposed performance measures, survival of the launch environment and performance in the space environment (Earth orbiting or deep space).
In Phase II the project could complete environmental qualification testing of the telescope including measuring optical figure before and after vibration testing, acoustic testing, and thermal cycling. It would also demonstrate that the telescope maintains optical figure in a reference thermal environment including thermal gradients.
A successful mission oriented Phase II would yield a credible plan to deliver (in phase III) flight hardware within the allocated budget for a fully assembled and tested telescope assembly which can be integrated into the potential mission; and, demonstrate an understanding of how the engineering specifications of their system meets the performance requirements and operational constraints of the mission (including mechanical and thermal stability analysis). Cost and schedule goals and optical performance goals are listed under State of the Art and Critical Gaps.
","Technical Challenges: To accomplish NASA CubeSat-class missions, a low-cost telescope with ultra-stable, normal incidence mirrors with low mass-to-collecting area ratios, should be delivered on short schedules. After performance, the most important metric for an advanced optical system is affordability. Long telescope fabrication times add significant program cost. Current normal incidence space telescopes in the 0.2- 0.5m aperture class have lead times of 12-18 months and cost $1 million to $5 million. This research effort seeks a schedule compression and cost reduction for precision optical components by 10 times, to 4-6 months and $100K-$500K for a 0.2 m aperture class telescope.
Specific metrics are defined for each wavelength application region:
For UV/Optical:
Wavefront Figure < 5 nm RMS. Wavefront Stability < 1 nm / 10 min First Mode Frequency >500 Hz. Actuator Resolution < 1 nm RMS.
For EUV:
Slope < 0.1 micro-radian.
Also needed is ability to fully characterize surface errors and predict optical performance.
","A new class of low-cost, optically stable, wide spectral range telescopes designed specifically for small spacecraft have application in a variety of exploration, commercial and science missions. Existing missions can be accomplished in novel and more affordable ways with small spacecraft, and new missions will be enabled by high-performance telescopes in small spacecraft. A few examples include: Earth resource management, maritime traffic monitoring, observations for agricultural industry from Low Earth Orbit; lunar exploration precursors and manned spacecraft inspection in cislunar space; and near Earth object detection or exoplanet transit detection in deep space.

Focus Area 21 Small Spacecraft Technologies,Z8.09Small Launcher Lunar Transfer Stage Development,,"NASA desires to explore the lunar environment using small spacecraft. The lunar environment in this case includes: the lunar surface with specific interest in the south pole, low lunar and frozen lunar orbits, as well as cislunar space including Earth-moon LaGrange points and the lunar Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHOs) intended for Gateway. To allow CubeSats and small spacecraft, defined as total mass less than 180 kg fueled, to exploit these locations, NASA is interested in the development of a low cost cis-lunar transfer stage to guide and propel small spacecraft on Trans Lunar Injection (TLI) trajectories that will enable the spacecraft to enter the above referenced lunar locations or orbits, either with on board propulsion capability or via the transfer stage itself.
Transfer stage architectures and designs shall be compatible with U.S. small launch vehicles that are currently flying or will be launching in the next year. Proposals should identify one or more relevant small launch vehicles and shall describe how their designs fit within the constraints of those vehicles. Transfer stage designs shall contain all requisite systems for navigation, propulsion, and communication in order to complete the lunar mission. Any and all propulsion chemistries and methods may be considered, including electric propulsion, as long as the design closes within the reference mission constraints. Transfer stages shall also include method(s) to deploy smallsat payloads once on a TLI trajectory or upon arrival in lunar orbit.
This subtopic is targeting transfer stages for launch vehicles that have a capability range similar to that sought by the NASA Venture Class Launch Services. Rideshare applications that involve medium or heavy lift launch vehicles (e.g. Falcon 9, Atlas V) or deployment via the International Space Station (ISS) airlock are not part of this topic.
Design reference mission:
Launch on a small launch vehicle (ground or air launch) Payload (deployable spacecraft) mass: at least 25 kg Provide sufficient delta V and guidance to enter into TLI after separation from small launch vehicle. An example mission is the CAPSTONE / NRHO Pathfinder 12U (25 kg) CubeSat that requires a Trans Lunar Injection orbit with a C3 of -0.6 km2/s2. (Optional) provide sufficient delta V and guidance to place a 25 to 50 kg spacecraft directly into lunar NHRO orbit Deploy spacecraft from transfer stage Safe and dispose of transfer stage
","Proposed technologies should mature to TRL 4 to 6 by the end of Phase II effort.
","Prototype Hardware and Software
Experimental data
Mission design and analysis data
","A Phase I effort should include a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) level design for a flight-like system and a near-Completion Design Review (CDR) level design for the prototype system. The feasibility of key elements in the system design should be evident through fabrication or testing demonstrations. The phase 1 report should include a mapping of key performance parameters (mass, power, cost, etc.) from the prototype to the flight design, along with potential opportunities for technology demonstration and commercialization. It is highly desired that the Phase II deliverable include demonstration test data for the prototype system along with detailed metrics (mass, power, cost, etc.) which are traceable to a flight design for the reference mission. Efforts leading to Phase II delivery of integrated prototype systems that could either be ground tested or flight-testing as part of a post-Phase II effort are of particular interest.
","Many cubesat/small sat propulsion units are designed for low delta-V maneuvers such as orbit maintenance, station keeping, or reaction control. Larger delta-V systems are employed for larger satellites and science/exploration missions, but are often costly and integrated as part of the satellite design. Systems typically range from cold-gas to bi-propellant storables with electric systems also viable for very small systems. Aerojet Rocketdyne and Moog are prominent suppliers of SOA thrusters including commonly used variants of the R-4D engine. Rocket Labs has recently introduced an upgraded version of their kick-stage using a monopropellant system to support LEO operations for small sat payloads. While many of the right component technologies are reasonably mature, no integrated system capability has been developed and implemented specifically as a low cost solution for trans-lunar or cis-lunar mission designs.
","This subtopic extends the capabilities of the Flight Opportunities Program and Launch Services Program by seeding potential providers to establish lunar/cis-lunar transfer capabilities.
Many technologies appropriate for this topic area are also relevant to NASA's lunar exploration goals. Small stages developed in this topic area would also be potential flight test beds for cryogenic management systems, wireless avionics, or advance guidance systems and sensors.

TRL 3 to 6 for embedded sensor systems and modular avionics technology development and prototype demonstration
","Prototype Hardware and Software, Demonstrations
","Possible deliverables include bench-top hardware systems that demonstrate reliable wireless inter-connectivity of two or more modules with a host flight CPU, or payload/DFI processor, inside a Cubesat or Small Satellite form-factor bus. This system need not be flight-ready, but it should be in a path to a flight demonstration that would serve as technology maturation and risk reduction activity for larger NASA missions such as Lunar Gateway, and other Artemis projects.
Specific Deliverables Include:
Methods of improving reliability of wireless avionics technology Redundancy methods to broaden mission applicability Improvements in tolerance to extreme environments including radiation Novel avionics architecture definition and demonstration Software support for redundant modular avionics Plug and Play methods for handling dynamic changes to avionics configuration Fault detection and recovery for wireless avionics Improvements in spacecraft production Improvements in spacecraft Integration and Test Technologies that use additive manufacturing technology for embedded avionics systems that reduce cables, connectors, and penetrations and show a path to a full solution. Sensors and sensor systems based on current technology needs to develop point solutions that are applicable to NASA missions in near to mid-range time frames
","Development of small satellites missions benefits from a growing number of users worldwide, resulting in a large pool of COTS components available for specific missions, depending on the type and class of mission. A variety of C&DH (Command and Data Handling) developments for CubeSats have resulted from in-house development, from new companies that specialize in CubeSat avionics, and from established companies who provide spacecraft avionics for the space industry in general. Presently there are a number of commercial vendors who offer highly integrated systems that contain the on-board computer, memory, electrical power system and the ability to support a variety of input & output for the CubeSat class of small spacecraft. Wireless networks have been incorporated as crew support networks aboard ISS, freeing the astronauts from cables. Wireless sensor networks have been flown as demonstrations aboard CubeSats. Dynamic self-configuring wireless networks have been evaluated in the lab. The AIAA has defined the Space Plug-and-Play (SPA) standard and flight demonstrations are planned.
The maturation of additive manufacturing and 3D printing technology are making embedded wireless sensors and avionics a possibility. Embedding transmission lines, antennas, connectors, and sensors onto a spacecraft structure turns that structure into a multi-functional system that reduces or eliminates bulky cables and connectors. Embedded passive wireless sensors can greatly increase sensing and telemetry capabilities, including providing low-cost techniques for vehicle health management for future missions. Moreover, flexible embedded passive sensors created with conductive and functional fabrics are enabling new opportunities for sensing in surfaces and systems where sensing has been traditionally absent such as parachutes and inflatable structures
","NASA and other space agencies are exploring the application of SmallSats for deep space missions. The availability of modular wireless data connectivity alleviates complexity in testing and integration of systems. Modular components allow easier reconfiguration and late additions to any design. This is a benefit conferred to any spacecraft of any size, with the larger systems benefiting from savings in mass due to a larger reduction in cable harnesses and connectors.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This subtopic solicits proposals to develop enabling concepts, components, and subsystems based on innovative avionics architectures for small spacecraft. Of interest are wireless systems that demonstrate reliable data transfer across avionics components, subsystems, and interfaces to simplify system integration, reconfiguration, and testing. Solutions that enable new avionic architectures and provide capabilities that expand mission performance while decreasing the Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) consumption and cost of the resulting spacecraft are highly desirable. The goal of this effort is to mature wireless avionics technology that facilitates the reuse of components, subsystems and software across multiple spacecraft and missions while reducing production and operating costs.
Modularity is defined as utilizing a set of standardized parts or independent units to form a full avionics system and flexibility allows adapting modular components across different configurations, missions, and design stages. For example, wireless subnets improve modularity by eliminating the physical data connections from each component, simplifying physical integration. The scope is intended to range from simple wireless sensors to complete avionics systems including software incorporating functions compatible with common spacecraft components. This means being able to integrate a given component or entire subsystem into flight hardware and software using object-oriented frameworks allowing components or functions to be added to a new or existing spacecraft design without requiring significant changes to the other non-related components or subsystems.
This subtopic also solicits proposals to develop techniques, components, and systems that reduce or eliminate the dependency on wires, connectors, and penetrations for sensing and for the transmission of data and power across avionics subsystems, interfaces, and structures. Of interest are techniques that enable new applications through the use of innovative methods such as the use of flexible materials and additive manufacturing. The use of additive manufacturing and 3D printing to embed avionics components such as antennas, sensors, transmission lines and interface functions into a spacecraft structure during the design and manufacturing process can increase efficiency while maintaining structural integrity. Similarly, the use of thin and flexible materials to construct passive wireless sensors enables sensing systems for structures such as parachutes and inflatable spacecraft without breaching the pressure interface. Systems that are applicable to small spacecraft (typically 6U/12U/24U CubeSats including ESPA-class), but scalable to large vehicles can result in a significant reduction of risk for more complex and longer duration missions. Near-term missions include: cislunar, lunar orbiting, lunar landed, exploration precursor; Low Earth Orbit (LEO ) “swarms” for Earth science and heliophysics; disaggregated cooperative ensembles and sustained infrastructure for human exploration. New applications might include manned spacecraft inspection, repair, communications support and related areas. Proposals that provide reliable performance in extreme environments and that show a path to a flight demonstration are preferable.
The subtopic solicits developments in wireless avionics and wireless sensing for small spacecraft and may include technologies that:
Improve the reliability and applicability of wireless avionics for small spacecraft with significant improvements in subsystem size, mass, volume, particularly if the technology can simplify the spacecraft fabrication, test and integration process. Allow innovative architectures for wireless avionics featuring plug-and-play software supporting modular subsystems that can be easily incorporated into specific small satellite missions. Improve fault detection aboard spacecraft using wireless sensor systems to augment current wired sensors and which include the capability of adding sensors to address Developmental and Flight Instrumentation use. Use additive manufacturing techniques for embedding sensors and other avionics components into a spacecraft to reduce or eliminate large and heavy cables and connectors or that enable data transfer inside and across rotating mechanisms and pressure interfaces or into remote locations where it is difficult or unfeasible to run cables or where cables are at risk of failure. Use additive manufacturing of wireless components such as antennas, sensors and processing elements into materials and structures that enable in-situ structural health management, contributing to the development of smart structures and materials. Include sensors and actuators that can be distributed among cooperative spacecraft to enable automated inspection of space assets or resource detection at the surface of the moon, Mars or other celestial bodies.

Focus Area 23 Digital Transformation for Aerospace,T11.03Distributed Digital Ledger for Aerospace Applications,,"A Blockchain is a decentralized, online record keeping system, or ledger, maintained by a network of computers that verify and record transactions using established cryptographic techniques. A Blockchain is a data structure that makes it possible to create a consistent, digital ledger of data and share it among a network of independent parties. Blockchain distributed ledger technology may become a key enabler of digital transformation, enabling peer to peer transactions without requiring intermediaries or pre-established trust. Blockchain was originally developed to support digital currency transactions. Now, application of Blockchain is being explored for other financial services, software security, Internet of Things, parts tracking (supply chain), asset management, smart contracts, identify verification, and much more.NASA is seeking innovative solutions involving Blockchain that would greatly enhance operational efficiency by providing a single, immutable ""source of truth"", viewable by all authorized parties, and usable by automated reporting and verification systems, for the following two NASA-specific challenges.Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) A significant challenge in MBSE is knowing that the system model being used is the current (or needed) version, since various aspects evolve through the system development and operations lifecycle. Further, because systems are becoming increasingly complex, tracking the vast number of changes that occur needs to be automated and efficient. Blockchain solutions may enable a single, real-time source of truth for system models, to eliminate several sources of error and inefficiency in MBSE.Distributed space mission management To accomplish complex space mission and Earth observation objectives, constellations of distributed satellites are often the most cost-effective approach. These constellations share key consolidated resources such as ground stations, a space network, communication networks, onboard processes, etc. A blockchain solution to managing distributed space missions should enable collaboration in a partially trusted environment and increase responsiveness, reliability, and availability of spacecraft and ground resources. The management functions enhance flexibility (e.g., reduce overhead for components to join and leave constellations), and enhance automation (e.g., automate resource outage alerts, facilitate localized replanning, enable a constellation level model-based diagnostics). To accomplish this, proposed solutions must overcome the slow transaction rate, large file sizes, and concurrency issues of some blockchain implementations.

Desired Deliverables Description
The desired deliverable is a prototype system that demonstrates a scalable, Blockchain-based solution to one of the NASA challenges described.
State of the Art and Critical Gaps
Almost all successful Blockchain solutions to date are for ledgers for digital currency transactions. Use of Blockchain is being explored in a broad range of areas, but there are no known scalable solutions for the NASA challenges described. Here, scalable means that the solution works efficiently and securely for a large number of transactions and users in a relevant, distributed digital environment.
Relevance / Science Traceability

NASA activities could be dramatically more efficient and lower risk through Blockchain support of more automated creation, execution, and completion verification of important agreements, such as international, supply chain, or data use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Focus Area 23 Digital Transformation for Aerospace,T11.04Digital Assistants for Science and Engineering,,"NASA is seeking innovative solutions that combine modern digital technologies (e.g., natural language processing, speech recognition, machine vision, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and virtual reality and augmented reality) to create digital assistants. These digital assistants can range in capability from low-level cognitive tasks (e.g., information search, information categorization and mapping, information surveys, semantic comparisons), to expert systems, to autonomous ideation. NASA is interested in digital assistants that reduce the cognitive workload of its engineers and scientists so that they can concentrate their talents on innovation and discovery. Digital assistant solutions can target tasks characterized as research, engineering, operations, data management and analysis (of science data, ground and flight test data, or simulation data), business or administrative. Examples of potential digital assistants include:
A digital assistant that uses the semantic, numeric, and graphical content of engineering artifacts (e.g., requirements, design, verification) to automate traces among the artifacts and to assess completeness and consistency of traced content. For example, the digital agent can use semantic comparison to determine whether the full scope of a requirement may be verified based on the description(s) of the test case(s) traced from it. Similarly, the digital assistant can identify from design artifacts any functional, performance, or non-functional attributes of the design that do not trace back to requirements. Currently, this work is performed by project system engineers, quality assurance personnel, and major milestone review teams. A digital assistant that can identify current or past work related to an idea by providing a list of related government documents, academic publications, and/or popular publications. This is useful in characterizing the state-of-the-art when proposing or reviewing an idea for government funding. Currently, engineers and scientists accomplish this by executing multiple searches using different combinations of keywords from the idea text, each on a variety of search engines and databases; then the engineers read dozens of documents and returns to establish relevance. This example looks for digital assistive technologies to reduce this workload substantially. A digital assistant that can highlight lessons learned, suggest reusable assets, highlight past solutions or suggest collaborators based on the content that the engineer or scientist is currently working on. This example encourages digital solutions that can parse textual and/or graphical information from an in-progress work product and search Agency knowledge bases, project repositories, asset repositories, and other in-progress work products to identify relevantly similar information or assets. The digital assistant can then notify the engineer of the relevant information and/or its author (potential collaborator). A digital assistant that can recommend an action in real-time to operators of a facility, vehicle, or other physical asset. Such a system could work from a corpus of system information such as design artifacts, operator manuals, maintenance manuals, and operating procedures to correctly identify the current state of a system given sensor data, telemetry, component outputs, or other real-time data. The digital assistant can then use the same information to autonomously recommend a remedial action to the operator when it detects a failure, to warn the operator when their actions will result in a hazard or loss of a mission objective, or to suggest a course of action to the operator that will achieve a new mission objective given by the operator. A digital assistant that can create one or more component or system designs from a concept of operations, a set of high-level requirements, or a performance specification. Such an agent may combine reinforcement learning techniques, generative-adversarial networks, and simulations to autonomously ideate solutions. An expert system that uses a series of questions to generate an initial system model (e.g. using Systems Modeling Language [SysML]), plans, estimates, and other systems engineering artifacts. Question and Answer (Q&A) Bots: A digital agent that can answer commonly asked questions on ""how-to"" for scientists and engineers (e.g., what resources [grounds facilities, labs, media services, IT] are available; where to get site licenses for software packages; who to contact for assistance on a topic; answers for general business procedures such as procurement, travel, time and attendance, etc.)
",3 to 5,"Prototype, Hardware, Software
","Phase II would conclude with a demonstration (prototype) or a deployable digital assistant with quantifiable reduction in time or cost of an activity typically performed by NASA scientists, engineers, or operators.
","Digitally assistive technologies currently permeate the consumer market with products like the Amazon Echo, Apple devices with Siri, Google devices with Google Assistant, and Microsoft devices with Cortana. Though Apple, Google, and Microsoft are also moving their assistive technologies into the enterprise space, these developments are largely focused on reducing information technology costs. Some cities and college campuses have also acted as early adopters of smart city or smart campus technologies that include digital assistants. However, application of these assistive technologies to engineering and science has largely been limited to university research. Moreover, most assistive technologies exercise no more cognition than a Q&A bot or executing simple commands. The emergence of improved natural language processing brings the possibility of digital assistants that can perform low-level cognitive tasks. This subtopic aims not only to bring commercially available assistive technologies to the engineering environment, but elevate their cognitive capabilities so that engineers and scientists can spend more time innovating and less time on low-level cognitive work that is laborious or repetitive.

Focus Area 24 Dust Mitigation,H3.03Lunar Dust Management Technology for Spacecraft Atmospheres and Spacesuits,,"Upon their return to Earth one of the Apollo astronauts commented that “dust is probably one of our greatest inhibitors to a nominal operation on the Moon.”Advances in spacecraft atmospheric quality management are sought to address the intrusion and containment of lunar dust in pressurized volumes and compartments in spacecraft systems. This will require the development of particle filtration and separation techniques, barrier techniques and monitoring instruments. For space suits, the challenge is to prevent dust intrusion, while at the same time providing the capability to mate and de-mate connectors and suit components as well as enabling venting to the environment for certain components. This will require the development of specialized dust covers for a variety of connections.
",3 to 4,"Prototype, Analysis, Hardware
","Phase I Deliverables - Reports demonstrating proof of concept, test data from proof of concept studies, concepts and designs for Phase II. Phase I tasks should answer critical questions focused on reducing development risk prior to entering Phase II.
Phase II Deliverables - Delivery of technologically mature hardware, including components, subsystems or treatments that demonstrate performance over the range of expected suit and spacecraft conditions. Hardware should be evaluated through parametric testing prior to shipment. Reports should include design drawings, safety evaluation, test data and analysis. Robustness must be demonstrated with long term operation and with periods of intermittent dormancy. System should incorporate safety margins and design features to provide safe operation upon delivery to a NASA facility.
","The state of the art in spacecraft filtration are HEPA filters used on the ISS, known as Bacterial Filter Elements (BFE).
There are currently no viable airborne particle sensors for pressurized volumes on the ISS or slated for future missions. Commercial sensors are only compatible with standard conditions (1 atmosphere) and terrestrial gravity levels. Also there are no commercial particle sensors that can discriminate between material types or particle shapes that may be used to distinguish between lunar dust and generic cabin dust.
","Lunar and Martian human surface missions (Artemis/lander/spacecraft) will be required to address and provide methods of controlling the intrusion of lunar dust into pressurized volumes.
The Life Support Systems (LSS) Project, under the Advanced Exploration Systems Program, Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD), is the expected customer for spacecraft cabin dust management technologies. The LSS Project would be in position to sponsor Phase III and technology infusion.
For Exploration EVA System Development, the xEMU Project is the expected customer.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Particle Filtration and Separation Techniques
Techniques and methods are sought leading to compact, low power, autonomous, regenerable bulk particulate matter separation and collection techniques suitable for general spacecraft cabin air purification and removal of planetary lunar dust in main cabin quarters and airlock compartments. The particulate matter removal techniques and methods must accommodate high volumetric flow rates up to 11.3 m3/minute and minimized pressure drop (typically <125 Pa). The filter and separation system needs to meet both the requirements for internally generated particulate matter, such as derived from materials, ECLSS and other processes, and biological matter and debris generated by the crew, and lunar dust intrusion. Permissible levels of suspended particulate matter total dust must be maintained to <3 mg/m3, and the respirable fraction of the total dust to <2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter to <1 mg/m3, as per the standards in the NASA-STD-3001 Vol 2, Rev. B. More specifically lunar dust needs to be maintained to a time-weighted average of 0.3 mg/m3 for particles < 10 μm during intermittent daily exposure periods that may persist up to 30 days in duration for the Gateway or Habitat, and an average of 1.6 mg/m3 for particles < 10 μm for a 7 day exposure period on the lander . Filtration performance should be at minimum 99.97 % collection efficiency for particles 0.3 micron in diameter and larger (or HEPA efficiency standard). The filter and separation system needs to also provide microbial and fungal control as outlined in the NASA-STD-3001 Vol 2, Rev. B requirements.
Barrier Techniques
Specialized particulate matter management systems specifically designed to collect and remove lunar dust from airlocks or suit preparation compartments or areas that provide a > 99.5% effective barrier to lunar dust transfer between different volumes or compartments are also of interest. The barrier technique can include filtration, separation and mitigation techniques used within these smaller pressurized compartments and/or techniques that prevent the transport or transfer of lunar dust between compartments or to main cabin areas.
Monitoring Instruments
Instruments, or instrument technology, that measure particulate matter concentrations and particle sizes to verify compliance with particulate matter cleanliness levels (stated above) are desired. In addition, the instrument will need to monitor lunar dust intrusion in airlocks and into main cabin areas. Real-time measurement instruments must be compact and low power, requiring minimal maintenance and be able to maintain calibration for years. The instrument also needs to be compatible with the microgravity, reduced gravity and reduced pressure environments (26.2 kPa < pressure ≤ 103 kPa) in the cabin and airlocks of the transit and lander vehicles. The different environmental parameters may necessitate different modes of operation within one instrument (preferred to minimize payload and operational resources) or it may require different sensor types. Particle sensors that are capable of distinguishing between different material types (lunar vs generic dust) when measuring particulate matter concentration and particle sizes will be highly desirable.
","Garment Protection:
A lunar space suit requires a dedicated Environmental Protection Garment (EPG) to protect the pressure garment and crewmember from the extreme lunar surface conditions. The extreme conditions include but are not limited to:
Extreme cold scenarios Extreme hot scenarios Highly abrasive lunar regolith
Not only does the EPG have to protect against the conditions above, but it must also not inhibit the space suit mobility. It would be beneficial if space suit solutions provide protection for the crewmember in the highly abrasive lunar regolith environment along with accommodating the extreme cold and hot conditions.
Venting Portable Life Support System (PLSS) Covers:
There are several spacesuit components that require access to the environment for gas flow, both in nominal and off-nominal operations. These components require specialized covers that prevent dust intrusion while at the same time allowing for sufficient gas flow. These components are:
PLSS Shell Vent Ports
The PLSS shell has two ports to allow the evaporated water from the spacesuit water membrane evaporator (SWME) and its backup the Mini Membrane Evaporator (Mini-ME) to escape. The operation of these components is dependent on a low back pressure and each of the vent ports must have a flow through area of at least 7 in2 to maintain the appropriate pressure for evaporation within the PLSS shell. The vents need to accommodate a water vapor mass flow of at least 2.6 lb/hr. The total area available for the vent ports is approximately 10 by 2.5 inches on either side.
PLSS Rapid Cycle Amine (RCA) System Vent Quick Disconnect
The RCA system for water vapor and CO2 removal requires vacuum access for the desorption of these constituents. This is accomplished via a Quick Disconnect (QD) on the PLSS backplate. For efficient desorption, the pressure in the vacuum access line needs to decrease quickly and allow the flow of 0.65 L of ullage gas to the environment. The ullage gas can be assumed to be 100 % O2 at 2.15 psi. Without a specialized cover, this gas dissipates within about 2 seconds. After the ullage gas has dissipated, the desorbed gas consists of CO2 and H2O with a mass flow of 325 to 360 g/min depending on the bed loading and metabolic rate of the crew member. Between 210 to 230 g/min of that flow is CO2. The rapid decompression of the vacuum line is essential for efficient operation of the RCA, as is the following diffusion of desorbed gas away from the absorber beds, both of which must not be impeded by the specialized dust cover.
Suit Purge Valve (SPV) and Low Flow Purge Valve (LFPV)
The SPV is located on top of the Display and Control Unit and is used during nitrogen purge operations in the airlock. The LFPV is used during off-nominal operations to ensure sufficient CO2 washout in the helmet and to provide some gas flow through the pressure garment. While similar in design, both valves require different flow rates. The SPV requires 3.15-3.38 lb/hr and the LFPV requires 1.55-1.69 lb/hr of O2 flow rate at 3.5 psi. Both valves are exposed on the outside of the spacesuit to enable crew member access and thus need specialized covers in order to tolerate large amounts of dust exposure.
Positive and Negative Pressure Relief Valves (PPRV and NPRV)
The PPRV and NPRV are located on the hard upper torso (HUT) and exposed to vacuum and dust. The full open flow rate requirement for the PPRV is 7.49 lb/hr of dry O2 at 70°F with suit internal pressure of 10.1 psia and vacuum as the external reference. The requirement for the NPRV is 60.4 lb/hr of dry air at 70°F, with the airlock pressure at 4.15 psia and a suit pressure at 3.65 psia. Specialized covers are needed in order to tolerate dust exposure.
Non-Venting Portable Life Support (PLSS) Covers:
Two other connectors are on the exterior of the suit that do not need vacuum access and are nominally covered during an Extravehicular Activity (EVA). However, they need to be accessed at the conclusion of an EVA at which point they may be covered in dust. Specialized covers for these connectors are needed to both protect the connectors from dust intrusion during the EVA as well as during the removal of the covers. The connectors are as follows:
An 85-pin receptacle that serves as the battery charge connector and is located on the bottom corner of the PLSS. The Spacesuit Common Connector (SCC) contains high pressure oxygen lines, water lines, an electrical connector as well as mechanical mounting features. The SCC is located on the front of the spacesuit and is integrated with the Display and Control Unit (DCU). The connector is flat and has a surface area of approximately 2.5 by 4 inches.
",
Focus Area 24 Dust Mitigation,Z13.01Active and Passive Dust Mitigation Surfaces,"Active Dust Mitigation Surfaces
","Proposals are sought that use unique methods that may require power, gases, mechanisms, vibrations or other means necessary to keep vital surfaces clean under space conditions. Self-cleaning surfaces are highly desired which require minimal effort by astronauts. Proposers are expected to show an in-depth understanding of the current state-of-the-art (SOA) and quantitatively describe improvements over relevant SOA technologies that substantiate investment in the new technology. Proposers must also quantitatively explain the operational benefit of the new technology from the perspective of improving or enabling mission potential. Some examples of active dust mitigation technologies include but are not limited to:
Brushing – a self-cleaning brush to mechanically remove dust from surfaces. The brush can be mechanically operated using power or temperature activated such as shape memory alloys Electrostatic Removal – methods to use DC electric fields to remove dust from surfaces either internal to the surface (embedded) or external using a removed high voltage source Liquid removal – a jet of liquid is applied to the surface which traps particles and removes them from the surface Vacuum – methods to remove particles from surfaces using suction of gases Jets - high-velocity gas jet which blows dust particles from surfaces. Spinning surfaces – surface rotates in a manner which does not allow collection of dust on it Vibrational surfaces – vibrating surface bounces the particles off of a surface Electrodynamic Removal – the surface contains embedded electrodes with varying high voltage signals applied to lift and transport dust off of the surface.
Proposals are highly sought in which the active dust mitigation strategy could be combined with the SOA of passive dust mitigation technologies. For example passive dust mitigation strategies include:
Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) coatings and films– statically dissipative coatings are less likely to accumulate charge and hence dust in dry environments Superhydrophobic coatings – materials with a very high contact angle can lower the adhesion of water-based contaminants not allowing the capillary forces to take hold. EVA and robotic compatible dust proof electrical, fluid, and gas connectors Dust proof bearings and mechanical spacesuit connectors Dust tolerant or resistant hatches Docking systems - including suit port docking systems and pressurized rover and habitat docking systems Lotus leaf coating – microscopic nanostructures used to limit the Van der Waals force of adhesion Peel away coating – removable coatings from surfaces
Strong proposals are those which identify the active dust removal strategy in coordination with other dust prevention and removal methods as listed above.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NASA seeks new technologies that can be used to remove dust from surfaces that may have accumulated as a result of interactions of systems or subsystems exposed to dusty surfaces either directly or indirectly as a result of missions to the moon, Mars and/or small bodies (like asteroids, comets, and Near-Earth Objects). Unique materials and technologies that reduce or mitigate lunar dust adhesion will be critical to support long duration missions and eventual sustained presence on the lunar surface. This call in particular seeks new technologies for the prevention and accumulation of dust on surfaces which could cause deleterious effects in lunar environments. Such technology could be implemented onto various surfaces such as solar panels, thermal radiators, space suit outer layers, helmets, visors, boots, displays, control panels, viewports, batteries are examples of solid flat transparent or non-transparent surfaces depending on the dust-loading requirements for each subsystem. More complex mechanisms such as hatches, hatch seals, hatch mechanisms, hinges, quick disconnects, etc. that require dust mitigation technologies are covered by subtopic ""Dust Tolerant Mechanisms.
"
Focus Area 24 Dust Mitigation,Z13.01Active and Passive Dust Mitigation Surfaces,"Passive Dust Mitigation Surfaces
","This call seeks unique research proposals focused on passive approaches, i.e., those that do not require external stimulus, that will minimize the potential impact Lunar dust will have on future exploration missions. These approaches may include novel materials and surfaces as well as technologies that require no external input (a self-activating system). Novel materials may include high performance plastics, metals, ceramics, etc. Surfaces may be homogeneous or heterogeneous, and rough or smooth with topography imparted by any number of approaches including but not limited to: lithography, embossing, roll-to-roll processing etc. Both the material and surface modification approach must be demonstrated to be scalable and exhibit a dramatic reduction (>90% relative to a reference material surface such as an aerospace aluminum alloy or polymeric film surface such as Kapton or Teflon) in particulate adhesion for micro-particles, specifically those described as Lunar dust simulant, with diameters < 50 micrometers.
",3 to 6,"Research, Analysis, Prototype, Hardware
","At the end of the Phase I research period, it is expected that a material or technology will be identified and initial characterization results collected. Initial characterization should indicate whether further development of the technology would be scalable and exhibit a dramatic reduction (>90% relative to full dust loading of a reference material surface such as an aerospace aluminum alloy or polymeric film surface such as Kapton or Teflon) in particulate adhesion for microparticles, specifically those described as Lunar dust simulant, with diameters < 50 micrometers. At the end of Phase II, it is expected that promising technologies will have been demonstrated through relevant environmental test conditions. The materials or technology should be demonstrated to be scalable to quantities sufficient for application beyond laboratory research requirements, i.e., at kilogram or greater quantities for materials or a similar measure for a passive technology. Cost analysis for scaling to mission-requirements level, as will be elucidated through the course of this research, will also be required.
If a Phase II is awarded, then further development of the technology shall be required, including a prototype delivered to NASA at the end of the two-year project with a goal of achieving TRL 6. A prototype of the new technology must be provided which shows the feasibility of the dust removal method. The technology must be demonstrated in a laboratory environment removing and/or keeping dust from adhering to a surface. The mass, power, volume and potential costs associated with the implementation of this technology must be addressed.
","Active Dust Mitigation Technologies
All new technologies for Active Dust Mitigation must include a full knowledge base of the SOA and proposals that advance the current SOA are encouraged. For example, NASA has developed the Electrodynamic Dust Shield or EDS which lifts and transports dust off of surfaces with embedded electrodes within a dielectric. A brief but not complete introduction to the technology can be found in the references above.
The EDS can be incorporated into a variety of configurations addressing many of NASA’s needs. However, there are several potential improvements and technologies that can further the development of the EDS technology are also highly sought within this call. Some potential advances include:
Miniaturized high voltage 3-phase power supply – The current SOA for the EDS power supply is approximately 10 cm X 5 cm X 3 cm. It is highly desired to have smaller power supplies both in size and power to drive the EDS waveform for a variety of applications. High dielectric breakdown strength for both glues/epoxies as well as the coating material – The efficiency of dust removal for the EDS is limited to amount of voltage that can be applied to the electrodes. The electrical breakdown occurs across the 2-D surface because of the dielectric strength limitation of the adhering material as well as the coating material. Flexible transparent surfaces with high current capabilities – The optically transparent version of the EDS uses Indium Tin Oxide as the main conductive medium for its electrode. Although the EDS is not a high current DC device, the displacement current (I dV/dt) can be quite high. Transparent electrode materials are sought that can replace ITO as the conductive medium that have higher current capabilities and lower overall resistivities. Another shortcoming of ITO is its range of flexibility. Many ITO coatings cannot be bent past a certain degree and are not compatible with numerous folds and bends. The EDS technology also works on fabrics. However high voltage flexible wires than can be used as threads are unavailable. The electrodes would need to be low profile and sufficient to withstand up to +10 kV DC before breakdown. A unique feature of the EDS on fabrics is that it needs to be a multilayer system as most space fabrics are. One layer would have to support electrical grounding to protect the astronaut but intermediate layers would have withstand high voltage breakdown. The top layer would house the HV wire system comprised of the EDS requirements. Electrical attachment – most EDS systems have issues with the electrical connections between the HVPS and the electrodes. Any possibility of arcing and/or sparking as a result of slight differences between the wiring from one material configuration to another is exacerbated when powered with EDS waveforms. Proposals are highly sought that address this key issue for attaching HV wires to electrodes embedded in an EDS circuit. EDS circuit electrodes are made using a variety of the materials such as: copper (wires or vapor deposited), ITO, silver paint wires, carbon nanotube (CNT) and graphene to name a few. Likewise these and other electrodes are usually resting on or embedded into a substrate such as glass, Polyimide (Kapton), clothing fibers, PET, PTFE, nylon, acrylic, Lucite and other surfaces. Minimizing electromagnetic interference (EMI) - Most EDS designs can generate electrical noise that would be disadvantageous for it to be incorporated into a system. Methods to reduce electrical noise and EMI would be highly sought. Safety - with all EDS systems, the use of high voltage requires safety measures for the astronaut and the equipment. Methods to improve the safety and reliability of the EDS in the case of arcing is highly sought. Smart EDS technology - as with all dust mitigation technologies, methods to included adaptive techniques are highly sought. The system should be able to check its environment to see if dust clearing is necessary, and if it is, apply power to the system until the cleanliness requirements are met for reliability and power minimization.
Other active systems also require maturation. Critical gaps in these areas include:
Effective and scratch resistant brushing techniques. Apollo astronauts used brushes that are largely ineffective for large surface areas and tended to scratch sensitive equipment, such as astronaut visors. Gaseous removal of dust on the lunar surface may contaminate other sensitive equipment. A better approach to gaseous or fluidized removal of dust is needed. Simple mechanical or vibrational dust mitigation implementations are required. As particles move, they also become highly electrostatically charged, further causing dust adhesion.
Passive Dust Mitigation Technologies
Although a myriad of materials and technologies exist for mitigation of surface contamination for a variety of terrestrial applications, requirements for mitigation of lunar dust adhesion indicate diminished efficacy of many materials. As an example, silicones are used ubiquitously to reduce adhesive interactions and can be effective for contamination prevention across a range of contaminants. These relatively soft materials though would exhibit deleterious properties in a traditional manifestation arising from particulate embedding due to the sharp edges and hardness of the lunar dust. Likewise, hard traditional ceramic materials have been shown to be beneficial for terrestrial applications. Triboelectrification, however, of an insulating material would increase adhesion interactions with lunar dust. Beyond these specific lunar dust properties, magnetic interactions, chemical activity, and the velocity of the Lunar dust, especially at the lunar terminator, all contribute to adhesion and therefore must be addressed for a material to be expected to perform well in this environment.
","Adhesion of granular materials and the technologies that address mitigation through this subtopic will advance the state of knowledge of this difficult research subject. The interplay between the surface’s energy, chemistry, mechanical properties and the particle’s surface is a fascinating but not well understood science. This call will not only extend exploration missions on the lunar surface, they will enable exploration missions that would not have be possible. For example every mechanical seal was compromised on the Apollo missions in the course three days due to the exposure to the dust. Research that elucidates this complex behavior toward lunar dust adhesion could be vital for realization of a sustained lunar presence and although our understanding of the lunar environments has continued to improve, materials and technologies that arise from this research will expound our survival on dusty surfaces in space.
Ideally, a universal lunar simulant will be identified by NASA and should be used for performance verification of developed technologies. If no universal simulant is identified, then the specific properties of the utilized particulate material should be identified and related to known properties of lunar dust.

","A return to the Moon to extend human presence, pursue scientific activities, use the Moon to prepare for future human missions to Mars and expand Earth’s economic sphere, will require investment in developing new technologies and capabilities to achieve affordable and sustainable human exploration. From the operational experience gained and lessons learned during the Apollo missions, conducting long-term operations in the lunar environment will be a particular challenge, given the difficulties presented by the unique physical properties and other characteristics of lunar regolith, including dust. The Apollo missions and other lunar exploration have identified significant lunar dust-related problems that will challenge future mission success. Comprised of regolith particles ranging in size from tens of nanometers to microns, lunar dust is a manifestation of the complex interaction of the lunar soil with multiple mechanical, electrical and gravitational effects.
Mechanical systems will need to operate on the dusty surface of the moon for months to years. These systems will be exposed to the harsh regolith dust and will have little to no maintenance. This scope seeks technologies that will protect from or tolerate dust intrusion in the following areas:
Rotary joints (steering, suspension, hinges, bearings, etc.) Linear joints (latches, shafts, restraint systems, landing gear, etc.) Static joints (quick disconnects, covers, airlocks, sample tools, etc.)
Successful solutions will enable operation in a lunar environment for 10 to 100 months with limited or no maintenance.
",2 to 6,"Prototype, Analysis, Hardware, Software, Research
","Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II demonstration with delivery of a demonstration package for NASA testing in operational test environments at the completion of the Phase II contract.
Phase I Deliverables - Research, identify and evaluate candidate technologies or concepts for dust tolerant mechanisms. Simulations or lab-level demonstrations are desirable. Deliverables must include a report to documenting findings.
Phase II Deliverables - Emphasis should be placed on developing, prototyping and demonstrating the technology under simulated operational conditions (regolith, thermal, vacuum). Deliverables shall include a report outlining the path showing how the technology could be matured and applied to mission-worthy systems, functional and performance test results and other associated documentation. Deliverable of a functional prototype is expected at the completion of the Phase II contract. The technology concept at the end of Phase II should be at a TRL of 6 or higher.
","Previous solutions used in the Apollo program did not address the current need of long term usage. Terrestrial solutions often employ materials or methods that are incompatible with the lunar environment.
Critical Gaps:
Rotary joints Seals: Rotary joints are very common for actuation in dusty environments because of the widespread availability of rotary seals. Most of these seals however use elastomers that would off-gas and become brittle in a lunar environment. Solutions are needed that employ materials or non-traditional techniques that can operate in the lunar environment for an extended period of time (months to years). Bearings: Regolith getting past the protective seals of rotary joints bearings is a common failure point. Bearings designs that are highly dust tolerant may be needed to reduce the risk of failures due to dust intrusion. Linear joints Seals: Linear joints are less common in dusty environments because of the challenge of sealing the sliding joints. Similar to rotary seals, linear joint seals are often made from elastomers and would need to be modified to operate in a lunar environment. Solutions are needed that employ materials or non-traditional techniques that can operate in the lunar environment for an extended period of time (months to years). Bearings: Regolith getting past the protective seals of linear joints bearings is a common failure point. Bearings designs that are highly dust tolerant may be needed to reduce the risk of failures due to dust intrusion. Static joints Operations on the lunar surface will include assembly, construction, and Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) tasks. These tasks will involve the mating/demating of various structural, electrical, and fluid connections. Dust on the surface of these joints will impede their proper function and lead to failures. Solutions are needed to protect these joints from dust contamination (e.g. power connection/termination related technologies that are impervious to environmental dust and enable robotic deployment, such as robotically-enabled high voltage connectors and/or near-field wireless power transfer in the 1-10kW range).

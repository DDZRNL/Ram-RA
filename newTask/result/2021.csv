Focus Area 1 In-Space Propulsion Technologies,Z10.01Cryogenic Fluid Management, GRC," JSC, MSFC", 2021,Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM),"This subtopic seeks technologies related to cryogenic propellant (e.g., hydrogen, oxygen, methane) storage and transfer to support NASA's space exploration goals. This includes a wide range of applications, scales, and environments consistent with future NASA missions. Such missions include, but are not limited to, upper stages, ascent and descent stages, refueling elements or aggregation stages, nuclear thermal propulsion, and in situ resource utilization (ISRU). Anticipated outcome of Phase I proposals is expected to deliver proof of the proposed concept with some sort of basic testing or physical demonstration. Proposals shall include plans for a prototype and demonstration in a defined relevant environment (with relevant fluids) at the conclusion of Phase II.Integrated refrigeration cycles for a combination of hydrogen and oxygen liquefaction on the lunar surface. Cycles should be initially sized for at least 11.7 metric tons per year (3.3 kg/hr of oxygen and 0.4 kg/hr of hydrogen). It is desired to minimize the mass and power of the system. Proposals should compare total input power and mass to liquefaction of fluids separately. The main contaminate is water; while the final contamination level is not known, some sensitivity should be explored in the 10s of ppm range in each stream. For Phase I, the main product should be cycle analysis and configuration, including the key sensitivities of the cycle. Phase II should include some level of buildup and test/demonstration of system. Subgrid computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of the film condensation process for 1g and low-gravity (lunar or martian) to be implemented into commercial industry standard CFD codes. The subgrid model should capture the formation and growth of the liquid layer as well as its movement along a wall boundary. The condensation subgrid model should be validated against experimental data (with a target accuracy of 25%), with emphasis on cryogenic fluid-based condensation data. The subgrid model and implementation scheme should be a deliverable. Phase I should be focused on simplified geometries (vertical plates/walls), while Phase II should be focused on complicated geometries (full propellant cylindrical). Integrated cryogenic propellant gas generation system for lander vehicles and supporting architecture: Design and develop concepts to enable integrated cryogenic propellant gas generation for lander vehicle reactor coolant system (RCS) gas accumulators. Proposers shall consider vehicle designs that use either liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen or liquid methane/liquid oxygen main propellant combinations. Designs shall be capable of outputting a minimum 3,000-psia storage press at 300-K storage temperature and meeting the following minimum mass gasification rates: 0.1 g/sec hydrogen, 0.3 g/sec methane, and/or 0.5 g/sec oxygen. The gas generation system shall demonstrate novel integration into alternate vehicle heat sources such as thermal control systems, active CFM cooling systems, fuel cells, internal combustion (I/C) engines, electrical power systems, pumps, etc. Proposed gas generation system shall not couple to vehicle main engines or RCS thruster during firing operations. Proposers should consider integration into vehicle system architectures, mass efficiency, and minimization of propellant waste. Phase I effort should include vehicle integration concept design, design of autogenous pressurization hardware, and test demonstration of autogenous pressurization hardware using liquid cryogens. Phase II should focus on system refinement and a scale test demonstration using liquid propellants. Develop cryogenic mass flow meters applicable to liquid oxygen and methane, having a volumetric flow measurement capacity of 1 to 20 L/min (fluid line size of approximately ½ in.), of rugged design that is able to withstand launch-load vibrations (e.g., 20g rms), with remote powered electronics (not attached to the flowmeter), able to function accurately in microgravity and vacuum environment, and having measurement error less than +/- 0.5% of the mass flow rate reading. Ability to measure bidirectional flow, compatibility with liquid hydrogen, and ability to measure mass flow rate during two-phase flows is also desired. Designs that can tolerate gas flow without damage to the flowmeter are also desired. Goal is proof of concept end of Phase I, working flowmeterend of Phase II.",2 to 4,"Level 1: TX 14 Thermal Management Systems

Software","Phase I proposals should at minimum deliver proof of the concept, including some sort of testing or physical demonstration, not just a paper study. Phase II proposals should provide component validation in a laboratory environment, preferably with hardware deliverable to NASA.","CFM is a crosscutting technology suite that supports multiple forms of propulsion systems (nuclear and chemical), including storage, transfer, and gauging, as well as liquefaction of ISRU-produced propellants. The Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) has identified that CFM technologies are vital to NASA's exploration plans for multiple architectures, whether it is hydrogen/oxygen or methane/oxygen systems, including chemical propulsion and nuclear thermal propulsion. Several recent Phase IIs have resulted from CFM subtopics, most notably for advanced insulation, cryocoolers, and liquid acquisition devices.","STMD strives to provide the technologies that are needed to enable exploration of the solar system, both manned and unmanned systems; CFM is a key technology to enable exploration. Whether liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen or liquid oxygen/liquid methane is chosen by Artemis as the main in-space propulsion element to transport humans, CFM will be required to store propellant for up to 5 years in various orbital environments. Transfer will also be required, whether to engines or other tanks (e.g., depot/aggregation), to enable the use of cryogenic propellants that have been stored. In conjunction with ISRU, oxygen will have to be produced, liquefied, and stored, the latter two of which are CFM functions for the surface of the Moon or Mars. ISRU and CFM liquefaction drastically reduces the amount of mass that has to be landed.","

Focus Area 1 In-Space Propulsion Technologies,Z10.03Space Nuclear Propulsion, MSFC," GRC, SSC", 2021,Reactor and Fuel System for Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) and Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP),"The focus is on highly stable materials for nuclear fuels and nonfuel reactor components (insulator, moderator, etc.) that can heat the working fluid to high temperatures, be compatible with the working fluid, minimize dimensional deformation during operation, and be easy to manufacture to meet the design requirements. NEP relies on reactor systems capable of achieving 5-yr life with a working fluid exit temperature of at least 927 °C and a thermal power of at least 5 MW.Innovative concepts for enhancing reactor reliability, fabricability, and testability while still enabling an acceptable power system specific mass (typically <15 kg/kWe) are sought. Projected use for human missions to Mars will require continuous run times ~2 yr. NTP uses hydrogen as the working fluid (propellant). Fuel temperatures required to achieve a specific impulse (Isp) of 900 sec can exceed 2,600 °C. Projected use for human missions to Mars will require cumulative run times ~3.5 hr and 5 to 6 restarts. Current technology hurdleswith ceramic and carbide fuels include embedding nitride or carbide kernels with coatings in a carbide matrix with potential for total fission product containment and high fuel burnup, and simple modern manufacturing of complex geometries with high uniform density. Specific technologies being sought include:Innovative ultrahigh-temperature material property testing and performance evaluation above 2,000 °C in a vacuum and hot hydrogen environment. The materials used in the reactor core will reach temperatures up to 2,700 °C. No current material property data and performance characteristics above 2,000 °C exist, and the subtopic wishes to solicit innovations in this area to start filling those data gaps, thus reducing technical risk of material choices within the reactor, and begin optimization of material choices. The key materials to be evaluated are the fuel element matrix materials, such as refractory ceramics. These materials are highly sensitive to oxygen and must be tested in a vacuum, inert atmosphere, or reducing (hydrogen) atmosphere. Some of the key parameters to gather at 2,000+ °C temperatures include (but are not limited to) static modulus, modulus of rupture, tension and compression flow curves, tension and compression creep, fatigue and hardness with measurement absolute accuracies ±0.5%. In addition to those key parameters, contact and noncontact strain measurement techniques with absolute accuracies of ±0.5% at these ultrahigh temperatures are also sought. Innovative fuel element designs and propellant flow configurations that facilitate achieving propellant exit temperatures in excess of 2,500 °C.",2 to 5,"Level 1: TX 01 Propulsion Systems

Hardware
Research","Desired deliverables for this technology would include research that can be conducted to determine technical feasibility of the proposed concept during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II hardware demonstration. Testing the technology in a simulated (as close as possible) NTP environment as part of Phase II is preferred. Delivery of a prototype test unit at the completion of Phase II allows for followup testing by NASA.Phase I Deliverables: Feasibility analysis and/or small-scale experiments proving the proposed technology to develop a given product (Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 to 3). The final report includes a Phase II plan to raise the TRL. The Phase II plan includes a verification matrix of measurements to be performed at the end of Phase II, along with specific quantitative pass-fail ranges for each quantity listed.Phase II Deliverables: A full report of component and/or breadboard validation measurements, including populated verification matrix from Phase I (TRL 3 to 5). Also delivered is a prototype of the proposed technology for NASA to do further testing if Phase II results show promise for NTP application. Opportunities and plans should also be identified and summarized for potential commercialization of the proposed technology. Unique government facilities can be used as part of Phase II.","The state of the art is reactor fuel developed for the Rover/NERVA program in the 1960s and early 1970s. The fuel was carbon based and had what is known as ""midband"" corrosion, which affected the fuel endurance. Switching over to cermet (metal and ceramics) or advance carbide fuels shows promise but has fabrication challenges. Limited property data for most materials at ultrahigh temperatures considered makes the material performance analysis to meet the engine operating requirements riskier.Focus is on a range of modern technologies associated with NTP using solid-core nuclear fission reactors and technologies needed to ground test the engine system and components. The engines are pump fed ~25,000 lbf with an Isp goal of 900 sec (using hydrogen) and are used individually or in clusters for the spacecraft's primary propulsion system. The NTP can have multiple startups (>5) with cumulative run time >200 min in a single mission, which can be no more than 2-yr round trip, according to a recent NASA study. The Rover/NERVA program ground tested a variety of engine sizes for a variety of burn durations and startups.","By closing these ultrahigh-temperature data gaps, the Space Nuclear Propulsion (SNP) project intends to infuse the results into design considerations/optimizations for risk reduction. In addition to directly benefiting SNP by closing the current material data gaps, the technology improvements in high-temperature materials would also benefit the following:Department of Defense (DOD) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) NTP program. Wing leading-edge systems, due to their use of refractory alloy base structures to 2,000 °C. Fission surface power, due to the use of materials in long-term high-temperature environments. Refractory reaction control systems (RCSs) that reach up to 2,000 °C temperatures. Refractory rocket nozzles for upper stages and landers that reach ~2,200+ °C.STMD (Space Technology Mission Directorate) is supporting the SNP project.Future mission applications:Human missions to Mars. Science missions to the outer planets. Planetary defense.Some technologies may have applications for fission surface power systems.","
Solid-core NTP has been identified as an advanced propulsion concept that could provide the fastest trip times for human missions to Mars over a variety of mission years. NTP had major technical work done between 1955 and 1973 as part of the Rover and Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA) programs. A few other NTP programs followed, including the Space Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (SNTP) program in the early 1990s. The NTP concept is like a liquid chemical propulsion system, except instead of combustion in the thrust chamber, a monopropellant is heated with a fission reactor (heat exchanger) in the thrust chamber and exposes the engine components and surrounding structures to a radiation environment.

Critical NASA electric propulsion needs have been identified in the scope areas detailed below. Proposals outside the described scope shall not be considered. Proposers are expected to show an understanding of the current state of the art (SOA) and quantitatively (not just qualitatively) describe anticipated improvements over relevant SOA materials, processes, and technologies that substantiate NASA investment.To shape the magnetic fields needed for operations, Hall-effect thrusters utilize a magnetic circuit that also forms the thruster structure. The magnetic circuit components direct magnetic flux (typically produced by electromagnetic coils) and may experience operational temperatures in excess of 500 °C due to coil self-heating and the close proximity of plasma-wetted surfaces. Both low-carbon magnetic iron and cobalt-iron (Co-Fe) soft ferromagnetic alloys have been traditionally used in the role; low-carbon magnetic iron is typically cheaper with larger billet size availability, whereas Co-Fe soft ferromagnetic alloys are attractive due to high magnetic saturation and Curie temperature properties. As Hall-effect thrusters become larger to support future high-power applications, thruster components also experience and must survive increased inertial launch loads. To address this issue, prospective magnetic circuit materials are desired with improved structural strength compared to SOA options while retaining comparable or better magnetic and thermal properties. Prospective materials capable of being produced in machinable, large-diameter (i.e., >400 mm) solid billets—or that can be additively manufactured to achieve comparable sizes—are of particular interest. This solicitation seeks such prospective magnetic circuit materials suitable for Hall-effect thruster applications with the following properties:Mechanical: Meets or exceeds yield stress properties in Table X2.4 of ASTM Standard A801-14.

A final report with test data either characterizing key material properties for produced large billets or demonstrating the functionality of one or more thruster components integrated with operating thruster hardware (in which partnering with electric propulsion developers may be necessary).,"SOA magnetic circuit materials used for Hall-effect thrusters are typically in two families: low-carbon magnetic iron or cobalt-iron (Co-Fe) soft ferromagnetic alloys (e.g., Hiperco®). While Co-Fe alloys are frequently preferred because of their magnetic and thermal properties, their available billet sizes do not readily accommodate larger thruster components needed for future high-power (i.e., >50 kW) electric propulsion applications. Low-carbon magnetic iron does come in large billet sizes, but past NASA high-power thruster development efforts (e.g., NASA-457Mv2 thruster) have identified potential risks regarding the survivability of components when subjected to launch loads. A magnetic circuit material that retains or exceeds the magnetic and thermal properties of SOA options while providing improved structural strength and scalability to large billet sizes is highly desirable to mitigate the risk.","Both NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) need spacecraft with demanding propulsive performance and greater flexibility for more ambitious missions requiring high duty cycles and extended operations under challenging environmental conditions.

Such cathodes pose significant thermal management challenges for the thruster and concerns about the cathode's cyclic lifetime. Alternative cathode architectures that can significantly reduce power consumption are highly desirable to reduce risk for high-power electric propulsion applications.Typical Hall-effect thrusters utilize a cathode flow fraction between 7% and 10% of the anode flow, with past studies of 50-kW-class thrusters at times requiring >10% cathode flow fraction to promote thruster stability at certain throttle points.

"Focus Area 2 Power, Energy and Storage",S3.02Dynamic Power Conversion, GRC, JPL, 2021,Dynamic Power Conversion,"NASA is developing dynamic radioisotope power systems (DRPSs) for unmanned robotic missions to the Moon and other solar system bodies of interest. This technology directly aligns with the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) strategic technology investment plan for space power and energy storage and could be infused into a highly efficient RPS for missions to dark, dusty, or distant destinations where solar power is not practical. Current work in DRPSs is focused on novel Stirling, Brayton, or Rankine convertors that would be integrated with one or more 250-Wth general-purpose heat source (GPHS) modules or 1-Wth lightweight radioisotope heater unit (RHU) to provide high thermal-to-electric efficiency, low mass, long life, and high reliability for planetary spacecraft, landers, and rovers. Heat is transferred from the radioisotope heat source assembly to the power convertor hot end using conductive or radiative coupling. Power convertor hot-end temperatures would generally range from 300 to 500 °C for RHU applications and 500 to 800 °C for GPHS applications. Waste heat is removed from the cold end of the power convertor at temperatures ranging from 20 to 175 °C, depending on the application, using conductive coupling to radiator panels. The NASA projects target power systems able to produce a range of electrical power output levels based on the available form factors of space-rated fuel sources. These include a very low range of 0.5 to 2.0 We that would utilize one or more RHU, a moderate range of 40 to 70 We that would utilize a single GPHS Step-2 module, and a high range of 100 to 500 We that would utilize multiple GPHS Step-2 modules. For these power ranges, one or more power convertors could be used to improve overall system reliability. The current solicitation is focused on innovations that enable efficient and robust power conversion systems. Areas of interest include:Robust, efficient, highly reliable, and long-life thermal-to-electric dynamic power convertors that would be used to populate a generator of a prescribed electric power output ranges. Electronic controllers applicable to Stirling, Brayton, or Rankine power convertors.Multilayered metal insulation (MLMI) for minimizing environmental heat losses and maximizing heat transfer from the radioisotope heat source assembly to the power convertor. Advanced dynamic power conversion components and RPS integration components, including efficient alternators able to survive extended exposure to 200 °C, robust high-temperature-tolerant Stirling regenerators, robust highly effective recuperators, integrated heat pipes, and radiators that improve system performance, and improve the margin, reliability, and fault tolerance for existing components.",1 to 4,"Level 1: TX 03 Aerospace Power and Energy Storage

Thermoelectric systems have been used on the very successful RPSs flown in the past, but are limited in efficiency. Dynamic thermal energy conversion provides significantly higher efficiency, and through proper engineering of the noncontact moving components, can eliminate wear mechanisms and provide long life. Although high-efficiency performance of dynamic power convertors has been proven, reliable and robust systems tolerant of off-nominal operation are needed. In addition to convertors appropriate for GPHS RPSs, advances in much smaller and lower power dynamic power conversion systems are sought that can utilize RHUs for applications such as distributed sensor systems, small spacecraft, and other systems that take advantage of lower power electronics for the exploration of surface phenomenon on icy moons and other bodies of interest. Although the power convertor advances are essential, to develop reliable and robust systems for future flight advances in convertor components as well as RPS integration components are also needed. These would include efficient alternators able to survive 200 °C, robust high-temperature-tolerant regenerators, robust high-efficiency recuperators, heat pipes, radiators, and controllers applicable to Stirling flexure-bearing, Stirling gas-bearing, or Brayton convertors.","This technology directly aligns with the Science Mission Directorate - Planetary Science Division for space power and energy storage.

"Focus Area 2 Power, Energy and Storage",S3.03Energy Storage for Extreme Environments, GRC, JPL, 2021,Energy Storage for Extreme Environments,"NASA's Planetary Science Division is working to implement a balanced portfolio within the available budget and based on a decadal survey that will continue to make exciting scientific discoveries about our solar system. This balanced suite of missions shows the need for low mass/volume energy storage that can effectively operate in extreme environments for future NASA Science Missions.Future science missions will require advanced primary and secondary battery systems capable of operating at temperature extremes from -200 °C for outer planet missions to 400 to 500 °C for Venus missions, and a span of -230 to +120 °C for missions to the lunar surface. Operational durations of 30 to 60 days for Venus; 30 to 60 days for deep-space environments such as Europa, Enceladus, and Titan; and 14-day eclipses for lunar night survival and operations on the Moon are of interest. Advancements to battery energy storage capabilities that address operation for one of the listed missions (Venus, deep space, or lunar) combined with high specific energy and energy density (>250 Wh/kg and >500 Wh/L for rechargeable or >800 Wh/kg and >1000 Wh/L for nonrechargeable at the cell level) are of interest in this solicitation. Novel battery-pack-level designs and technologies that enhance battery reliability and safety and support improved thermal management are also of interest. Combinations of cell-level improvements and/or battery-system-level improvement for enhanced temperature capability will be considered.Furthermore, missions that incorporate nonrechargeable (primary) batteries will benefit from instrumentation or modeling that can effectively determine state of charge to a high degree of accuracy and/or state of health, particularly those missions that use cell chemistries with discharge voltage profiles that are a weak function of state of charge or state of health such as lithium carbon monofluoride (Li-CFx) cells. Technologies of interest include: radiation-hardened (to 1 Mrad total ionizing dose) coulomb integration application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) or hybrid circuits, with >1% accuracy over 1 to 20 A, operating over 24 to 36 V; computational models that can predict state of charge/state of health for primary cells; nondestructive instrumentation that can detect state of charge/state of health for primary and secondary cells.",3 to 5,"Level 1: TX 03 Aerospace Power and Energy Storage
Level 2: TX 03.2 Energy Storage",Prototype,"Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility in a final report for Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II, and when possible, deliver a demonstration unit for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. Phase II emphasis should be placed on developing and demonstrating the technology under relevant test conditions. Additionally, a path should be outlined that shows how the technology could be commercialized or further developed into science-worthy systems.","State-of-the-art primary and rechargeable cells are limited in both capacity and temperature range. Typical primary Li-SO2 and Li-SOCl2 operate within a maximum temperature range of -40 to 80 °C but suffer from capacity loss, especially at low temperatures. At -40 °C, the cells will provide roughly half the capacity available at room temperature. Similarly, rechargeable Li-ion cells operate within a narrow temperature range of -20 to 40 °C and also suffer from capacity loss at lower temperatures. The lower limit of temperature range of rechargeable cells can be extended through the use of low-temperature electrolytes, but with limited rate capability and concerns over lithium plating on charge. There is currently a gap that exists for high-temperature batteries, primary and rechargeable, that can operate at Venus atmospheric temperatures. In addition, there is a gap in the ability to accurately predict or measure the amount of usable capacity of primary battery cells, particularly after a long mission cruise with exposure to varying temperatures and ionizing radiation dose. This solicitation is aimed at the development of cells that can maintain performance at extreme temperatures to minimize or eliminate the need for strict thermal management of the batteries (which adds complexity and mass to the spacecraft) as well as instrumentation or modeling to predict state of charge/state of health of primary batteries for deep-space missions.","These batteries are applicable over a broad range of science missions. Low-temperature batteries are needed for potential NASA decadal missions to ocean worlds (Europa, Enceladus, and Titan) and the icy giants (Neptune, Uranus). These batteries are also needed for science missions on the lunar surface. Low-temperature batteries developed under this subtopic would enhance these missions and could be potentially enabling if the missions are mass or volume limited. There is also significant interest in a Venus surface mission that will require primary and/or rechargeable batteries that can operate for 60+ days on the surface of Venus. A high-temperature battery that can meet these requirements is enabling for this class of missions.","

"Focus Area 2 Power, Energy and Storage",Z1.05Lunar and Planetary Surface Power Management and Distribution, GRC," GSFC, JSC", 2021,Innovative Ways to Transmit Power Over Long Distances for Lunar and Mars Missions,"The Global Exploration Roadmap (January 2018) and the Space Policy Directive (December 2017) detail NASA’s plans for future human-rated space missions. A major component of these plans involves establishing bases on the lunar surface for sustained presence and a new transportation capability and surface assets for a human exploration mission to Mars. Surface power generation on planetary surfaces is envisioned to require 10 to 50 kW to be efficiently transmitted distances greater than 1 km to remotely located mission elements such as habitat modules, landers, ascent vehicles, etc. While current state-of-the-art space power systems are similar in power level (e.g., the International Space Station), the transmission distances are only 10s of meters, so new high-power, high-voltage and/or new power-beaming technologies are sought to enable surface power transmission over long distances. Examples of the innovative technologies sought are lower mass/higher efficiency power electronic regulators, switchgear, cabling, connectors, wireless sensors, power beaming, power scavenging, and power management control. The technologies of interest would need to operate in extreme-temperature environments, including lunar night, and could experience temperature changes from -153 to 123 °C for lunar applications, and -125 to 80 °C for Mars bases. In addition to temperature extremes, technologies would need to withstand (have minimal degradation from) lunar dust/regolith, Mars dust storms, and space radiation levels. In addition, new human Mars transportation capabilities are expected to require multiple channels of 100 kW or more to be efficiently transmitted 100s of meters from an alternating current (AC) power generator to multiple electric thrusters requiring high-voltage direct-current (DC) power. Technologies sought include high-performance rotary alternators, high-performance transformers, rectifiers, and cabling.While this subtopic would directly address the lunar and Mars base initiatives, technologies developed could also benefit other NASA Mission Directorates, including SMD (Science Mission Directorate) and ARMD (Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate). Specific projects that could find value in the technologies developed herein include Gateway, In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), Advanced Modular Power Systems (AMPS), In-Space Electric Propulsion, Planetary Exploration, and Hybrid Gas-Electric Propulsion. The power levels may be different, but the technology concepts could be similar, especially when dealing with temperature extremes and the need for electronics with higher power density and efficiency. Specific technologies of interest would include:Application of wide band-gap electronics in DC-DC isolating converters with wide temperature (-70 to 150 °C), high power density (>2 kW/kg), high-efficiency (>96%) power electronics and associated drivers for voltage regulation. Low-mass, highly conductive wires and terminations that provide reliable small gauges for long-distance power transmission in the 1 to 10 kW range, low-mass insulation materials with increased dielectric breakdown strength and void reductions with 1,000 V or greater ratings, and low-loss/low-mass shielding. Power-beaming concepts to enable highly efficient flexible/mobile power transfer in the 100 to 1,000 W range, including the fusion of power, communication, and navigation. Power generation and distribution components of a 3-phase/1,200-Hz permanent magnet alternator, 480 VAC to 650 VDC power management, and distribution with direct drive to Hall thrusters. Key components of the distribution include high-performance rotary alternators and AC transmission technologies, including alternator voltage, step-up/step-down transformers, rectifiers, and power cabling.Note: to propose power connection/termination-related technologies that are impervious to environmental dust and enable robotic deployment, such as robotically enabled high-voltage connectors and/or near-field wireless power transfer in the 1 to 10 kW range, see subtopic titled Dust-Tolerant Mechanisms.",3 to 6,"Level 1: TX 03 Aerospace Power and Energy Storage

Unique challenges must be overcome in order to enable a realistic power architecture for these future applications, especially when dealing with the environmental extremes that will be encountered. The temperature swings will be a critical requirement on any technology developed, from power converters to cabling or power-beaming concepts. In addition, proposals will have to consider lunar regolith and Mars dust storms. To enable a new Mars transportation capability for human exploration, new technology development must be started soon to address the very unique needs of a mixed AC/DC space-rated power system to prove feasibility and provide realistic performance metrics for detailed vehicle design concepts and mission trade studies.","This subtopic would directly address a remaining technology gap in the lunar and Mars surface mission concepts and Mars human transportation needs. There are potential infusion opportunities with SMD (Science Mission Directorate) Commercial Lander Payload Services (CLPS) and HEOMD (Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate) Flexible Lunar Exploration (FLEx) Landers.

"Focus Area 2 Power, Energy and Storage","Z1.06Radiation-Tolerant High-Voltage, High-Power Electronics", GSFC," GRC, JPL, LaRC", 2021,"Radiation-Tolerant High-Voltage, High-Power Electronics","NASA’s directives for space exploration and habitation require high-performance, high-voltage transistors and diodes capable of operating without damage in the natural galactic cosmic ray space radiation environment. Recently, significant progress has been made in the research community in understanding the mechanisms of heavy-ion-radiation-induced single-event-effect (SEE) degradation and catastrophic failure of wide bandgap (WBG) power transistors and diodes. This subtopic seeks to facilitate movement of this understanding into the successful development of radiation-hardened high-voltage transistors and rectifiers to meet NASA mission power needs reliably in the space environment. These needs include:High-voltage, high-power solutions: Taxonomy Area (TX) 03.3.4, Power Management and Distribution (PMAD) - Advanced Electronic Parts, calls out the need for development of radiation-hardened high-voltage components for power systems. NASA has a core need for diodes and transistors that meet the following specifications: Diodes: minimum 1200 V, 40 A, with fast recovery <50 ns. Forward voltage drop should not exceed 150% of that in state-of-the-art unhardened diodes. Transistors: minimum 650 V, 40 A, with <24-mohm on-state drain-source resistance. High-voltage, low-power solutions: In support of TX 8.1.2 (Sensors and Instruments - Electronics), radiation-hardened high-voltage transistors are needed for low-mass, low-leakage, high-efficiency applications such as LIDAR Q-switch drivers, mass spectrometers, and electrostatic analyzers. High-voltage, fast-recovery diodes are needed to enhance performance of a variety of heliophysics and planetary science instruments. Transistors: minimum 1000 V, <40-ns rise and fall times Diodes: 2 kV to 5 kV, <50-ns recovery time. Forward voltage drop should not exceed 150% of that in state-of-the-art unhardened diodes. High-voltage, low- to medium-power solutions: In support of peak-power solar tracking systems for planetary spacecraft and small satellites, transistors and diodes are needed to increase buck converter efficiencies through faster switching speeds. Transistors: minimum 600 V, <50-ns rise and fall times, current ranging from low to >20 A. Successful proposal concepts should result in the fabrication of transistors and/or diodes that meet or exceed the above performance specifications without susceptibility to damage due to the galactic cosmic ray heavy-ion space radiation environment (SEEs resulting in permanent degradation or catastrophic failure). These diodes and/or transistors will form the basis of innovative high-efficiency, low-mass and low-volume systems and therefore must significantly improve upon the electrical performance available from existing heavy-ion SEE radiation-tolerant devices.Other innovative heavy-ion SEE radiation-tolerant, high-power, high-voltage discrete device technologies will be considered that offer significant electrical performance improvement over state-of-the-art heavy-ion SEE radiation-tolerant power devices.",4 to 5,"Level 1: TX 03 Aerospace Power and Energy Storage
Level 2: TX 03.3 Power Management and Distribution","Hardware
Prototype
Analysis","Phase I deliverables must state the initial state of the art for the proposed technology and justify the expected final performance metrics. Well-developed plans for validating the tolerance to heavy-ion radiation must be included, and the expected total ionizing dose tolerance should be indicated and justified. Target radiation performance levels will depend upon the device structure due to the interaction of the high electric field with the ionizing particle:For vertical-field power devices: No heavy-ion-induced permanent destructive effects upon irradiation while in blocking configuration (in powered reverse-bias/off state) with ions having a silicon-equivalent surface-incident linear energy transfer (LET) of 40 MeV-cm2/mg and sufficient energy to maintain a rising LET level throughout the epitaxial layer(s). For all other devices: No heavy-ion-induced permanent destructive effects upon irradiation while in blocking configuration (in powered reverse-bias/off state) with ions having a silicon-equivalent surface-incident LET of 75 MeV-cm2/mg and sufficient energy to fully penetrate the active volume prior to the ions reaching their maximum LET value (Bragg peak).Deliverables in Phase II shall include prototype and/or production-ready semiconductor devices (diodes and/or transistors); and device electrical and radiation performance characterization (device electrical performance specifications, heavy-ion SEE radiation test results, and total-dose radiation analyses).","High-voltage silicon power devices are limited in current ratings and have limited power efficiency and higher losses than do commercial WBG power devices. Efforts to space-qualify WBG power devices to take advantage of their tremendous performance advantages revealed that they are very susceptible to damage from the high-energy, heavy-ion space radiation environment (galactic cosmic rays) that cannot be shielded against. Higher voltage devices are more susceptible to these effects; as a result, to date, there are space-qualified GaN transistors now available, but these are limited to 300 V. Recent radiation testing of 600-V and higher GaN transistors has shown failure susceptibility at about 50% of the rated voltage, or less. Silicon carbide power devices have undergone several generation advances commercially, improving their overall reliability, but catastrophically fail at less than 50% of their rated voltage.Specific needs in STMD (Space Technology Mission Directorate) and SMD (Science Mission Directorate) areas have been identified for spacecraft power management and distribution (PMAD), and science instrument power applications and device performance requirements to meet these needs are included in this subtopic nomination. In all cases, there is no alternative solution that can provide the mass and power savings sought to enable game-changing capability. Current PPUs (power processing units) and instrument power systems rely on older silicon technology with many stacked devices and efficiency penalties. In NASA's move to do more with less (smaller satellites), and its lunar/planetary habitation objectives requiring tens to 100 kW power production, the technology sought by this subtopic is truly enabling. State-of-the-art, currently available heavy-ion SEE-tolerant silicon power devices include a Schottky diode capable of 600 V, 30 A, and 27-ns recovery time, and a power MOSFET capable of 650 V, 8 A, with on-state resistance of 450 mohm. Commercial (non-SEE tolerant) SiC and GaN offerings are available that meet the electrical performance needs indicated in this subtopic, but that cannot meet the heavy-ion SEE requirements indicated. At this time, there are no publicly available data on the heavy-ion SEE performance of Ga2O3 or diamond power devices.","Power transistors and diodes form the building blocks of numerous power circuits for spacecraft and science instrument applications. This subtopic therefore feeds a broad array of space technology hardware development activities by providing SEE (heavy-ion) radiation-hardened state-of-the-art device technologies that achieve higher voltages with lower power consumption and greater efficiency than presently available.Taxonomy Area (TX) 03.3.4, Power Management and Distribution (PMAD) - Advanced Electronic Parts, calls out the need for development of radiation-hardened high-voltage components for power systems. This subtopic serves as a feeder to the subtopic Lunar and Planetary Surface Power Distribution, in which WBG circuits for PMAD applications are solicited. The solicited developments in this subtopic will also feed systems development for the NASA Kilopower project due to the savings in size/mass combined with radiation hardness.TX 08.1.2, Sensors and Instruments - Electronics: Radiation-hardened high-voltage transistors are needed for low-mass, low-leakage, high-efficiency applications such as LIDAR Q-switch drivers, mass spectrometers, and electrostatic analyzers. These applications are aligned with science objectives including Earth science LIDAR needs, Jovian moon exploration, and Saturn missions. Finally, mass spectrometers critical to planetary and asteroid research and in the search for life on other planets such as Mars require high-voltage power systems and will thus benefit from mass and power savings from this subtopic's innovations.","

Brayton, Rankine, and Stirling convertors are of primary interest. Multiple parallel/redundant convertors may be used to achieve the megawatt-class power level. Includes subcomponents such as efficient turbomachinery, bearings, alternators, recuperators, and heat exchangers. Convertors must be capable of interfacing with pumped liquid-metal loops: one for thermal energy input and one for heat rejection.In addition, liquid metal pumps that address the following technical challenges are also needed:Can operate for long periods of time (years) at relevant in-space (in vacuum and zero g) reactor/power generation temperatures. Can withstand liquid metal freeze-thaw transition during initial reactor startup in zero g. Low mass and high efficiency at fluid throughputs that are relevant for in-space nuclear power generation. Wetted surfaces of the pump composed of materials that are compatible with liquid metals under consideration for in-space nuclear power generation (NaK, Li, etc.).The desired deliverables are primarily prototype hardware, research, and analysis to demonstrate concept feasibility and a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) range of 3 to 5. There is a strong desire for hardware that can operate or has a clear path for operation in the relevant space environment.

Higher power electric propulsion systems are currently being considered to support crewed missions to near-Earth asteroids and as cargo transport for sustained lunar or Mars exploration, and for very high power crewed missions to Mars and the outer planets. One of the key technologies required in a NEP system is the power convertor. A recent Mars Transportation Assessment Study was completed that included Brayton, Stirling, Rankine, thermoelectric, and thermionic technologies in the trade space. The study identified HeXe Brayton as the baseline dynamic power convertor in the reference NEP concept, with supercritical CO2 Brayton and K-Rankine as the primary options. Current state-of-the-art Brayton technology has been demonstrated in a relevant space environment (ground test) in the 10s of kWe range. Convertor scaleup to the 100s of kWe per unit is required.",This technology directly aligns with the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) roadmap for space power and energy storage.,"

Focus Area 3 Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration,H6.22Deep Neural Net and Neuromorphic Processors for In-Space Autonomy and Cognition, GRC, ARC, 2021,Neuromorphic Capabilities,"This subtopic specifically focuses on advances in signal and data processing. Neuromorphic processing will enable NASA to meet growing demands for applying artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms onboard a spacecraft to optimize and automate operations. This includes enabling cognitive systems to improve mission communication and data-processing capabilities, enhance computing performance, and reduce memory requirements. Neuromorphic processors can enable a spacecraft to sense, adapt, act, and learn from its experiences and from the unknown environment without necessitating involvement from a mission operations team. Additionally, this processing architecture shows promise for addressing the power requirements that traditional computing architectures now struggle to meet in space applications. The goal of this program is to develop neuromorphic processing software, hardware, algorithms, architectures, simulators, and techniques as enabling capability for autonomous space operations. Emerging memristor and other radiation-tolerant devices, which show potential for addressing the need for energy-efficient neuromorphic processors and improved signal processing capability, are of particular interest due to their resistance to the effects of radiation. Additional areas of interest for research and/or technology development include: (a) spiking algorithms that learn from the environment and improve operations, (b) neuromorphic processing approaches to enhance data processing, computing performance, and memory conservation, and (c) new brain-inspired chips and breakthroughs in machine understanding/intelligence. Novel memristor approaches that show promise for space applications are also sought. This subtopic seeks innovations focusing on low-size, -weight, and -power (-SWaP) applications suitable to lunar orbital or surface operations, thus enabling efficient onboard processing at lunar distances. Focusing on SWaP-constrained platforms opens up the potential for applying neuromorphic processors in spacecraft or robotic control situations traditionally reserved for power-hungry general-purpose processors. This technology will allow for increased speed, energy efficiency, and higher performance for computing in unknown and uncharacterized space environments including the Moon and Mars. Proposed innovations should justify their SWaP advantages and target metrics over the comparable relevant state of the art.",4 to 6,"Level 1: TX 10 Autonomous Systems

Software","Phase I will emphasize research aspects for technical feasibility and show a path toward a Phase II proposal. Phase I deliverables include concept of operations of the research topic, simulations, and preliminary results. Early development and delivery of prototype hardware/software is encouraged.Phase II will emphasize hardware and/or software development with delivery of specific hardware and/or software products for NASA, targeting demonstration operations on a low-SWaP platform. Phase II deliverables include a working prototype of the proposed product and/or software, along with documentation and tools necessary for NASA to use the product and/or modify and use the software. In order to enable mission deployment, proposed prototypes should include a path, preferably demonstrated, for fault and mission tolerances. Phase II deliverables should include hardware/software necessary to show how the advances made in the development can be applied to a CubeSat, SmallSat, and rover flight demonstration.","The current state of the art (SOA) for in-space processing is the High Performance Spaceflight Computing (HPSC) processor being developed by Boeing for NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). The HPSC, called the Chiplet, contains 8 general purpose processing cores in a dual quad-core configuration. Delivery is expected by December 2022. In a submission to the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) Game Changing Development (GCD) program, the highest computational capability required by a typical space mission is 35 to 70 GFLOPS (billion fast logical operations per second).The current SOA does not address the capabilities required for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in the space environment. These applications require significant amounts of multiply and accumulate operations, in addition to a substantial amount of memory to store data and retain intermediate states in a neural network computation. Terrestrially, these operations require general-purpose graphics processing units (GP-GPUs), which are capable of teraflops (TFLOPS) each—approximately 3 orders of magnitude above the anticipated capabilities of the HPSC.Neuromorphic processing offers the potential to bridge this gap through a novel hardware approach. Existing research in the area shows neuromorphic processors to be up to 1,000 times more energy efficient than GP-GPUs in artificial intelligence applications. Obviously, the true performance depends on the application, but nevertheless the architecture has demonstrated characteristics that make it well-adapted to the space environment.","The Cognitive Communications Project, through the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Program, is one potential customer of work from this subtopic area. Neuromorphic processors are a key enabler to the cognitive radio and system architecture envisioned by this project. As communications become more complex, cognition and automation will play a larger role to mitigate complexity and reduce operations costs. Machine learning will choose radio configurations and adjust for impairments and failures. Neuromorphic processors will address the power requirements that traditional computing architectures now struggle to meet and are of relevance to Lunar return and Mars for autonomous operations, as well as of interest to HEOMD and Science Mission Directorate (SMD) for in situ avionics capabilities.","

Focus Area 3 Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration,H6.23Spacecraft Autonomous Agent Cognitive Architectures for Human Exploration, ARC, JSC, 2021,Learning and Adaptation for Space Cognitive Agents,"This subtopic solicits intelligent autonomous agent cognitive architectures that are open, modular, make decisions under uncertainty, and learn in a manner that the performance of the system is assured and improves over time. Cognitive agents for space applications need to adapt and learn from observation, instruction, and interaction as missions proceed. The value of preprogrammed agents that do not adapt over time will diminish in extended missions. Building upon the success of the previous solicitations, this extended scope will enable small businesses to develop both the learning technology and the necessary assurance technology within the scope of cognitive agents that forward base mission control to spacecraft and habitats, and multiply the cognitive assets available to the crew.It should be feasible for cognitive agents based on these architectures to be certified or licensed for use on deep space missions to act as liaisons that interact both with the mission control operators, the crew, and most, if not all, of the spacecraft subsystems. With such a cognitive agent that has access to all onboard data and communications, the agent could continually integrate this dynamic information and advise the crew and mission control accordingly by multiple modes of interaction including text, speech, and animated images. This agent could respond to queries and recommend to the crew courses of action and direct activities that consider all known constraints, the state of the subsystems, available resources, risk analyses, and goal priorities.Cognitive architectures capable of being certified for crew support on spacecraft are required to be open to NASA with interfaces open to NASA partners who develop modules that integrate with the agent, in contrast to proprietary black-box agents. A cognitive agent suitable to provide crew support on spacecraft may be suitable for a wide variety of Earth applications, but the converse is not true requiring this NASA investment.Proposals should emphasize analysis and demonstration of the feasibility of various configurations, capabilities, and limitations of a cognitive architecture suitable for crew support on deep space missions. The software engineering of a cognitive architecture is to be documented and demonstrated by implementing a prototype goal-directed software agent that interacts as an intermediary/liaison between simulated spacecraft systems and humans.Proposals should emphasize analysis and demonstration of the feasibility of various configurations, capabilities, and limitations, and address learning and adaptation during mission scenarios of a cognitive architecture suitable for crew support on deep space missions.

A preliminary demonstration prototype of the proposed cognitive architecture is highly encouraged.For Phase II, the Phase I proposed detailed feasibility study plan is executed generating a comprehensive cognitive architecture, comprehensive feasibility study report including design artifacts such as System Modeling Language/Unified Modeling Language (SysML/UML) diagrams, a demonstration of an extended prototype of an agent that instantiates the architecture interacting with a spacecraft simulator and humans executing a plausible Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) design reference mission beyond cislunar orbit (e.g., Human Exploration of Mars Design Reference Mission: https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/373665main_NASA-SP-2009-566.pdf), and a detailed plan to develop a comprehensive cognitive architecture feasibility study suitable for proposing to organizations interested in funding this flight capability is expected. A Phase II prototype suitable for a compelling flight experiment on the ISS is encouraged.","Long-term crewed spacecraft, such as the International Space Station, are so complex that a significant portion of the crew's time is spent keeping it operational even under nominal conditions in low-Earth orbit and still require significant real-time support from Earth. Autonomous agents performing cognitive computing can provide crew support for future missions beyond cislunar by providing them robust, accurate, and timely information, and perform tasks enabling the crew more time to perform the mission science. The considerable challenge is to migrate the knowledge and capability embedded in current Earth mission control, with tens to hundreds of human specialists ready to provide instant knowledge, to onboard agents that team with flight crews to autonomously manage a space-flight mission.The majority of Apollo missions required the timely guidance of mission control for success, typically within seconds of an off-nominal situation. Outside of cislunar space, the time delays will become untenable for Earth to manage time-critical decisions as was done for Apollo. The emerging field of cognitive computing is a vast improvement on previous information retrieval and integration technology, and is likely capable to provide this essential capability.Investments continue to be made in a wide variety of cognitive agents. However, a critical gap that this subtopic addresses is assured learning for cognitive agents enabling it to appropriately adapt to the crew it interacts with in a manner that assures performance improves and not degrades over time mitigating risks related to learning systems.","This subtopic is directly relevant to the HEOMD Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) domain: Foundational Systems - Autonomous Systems and Operations.There is growing interest in NASA to support long-term human exploration missions to the Moon and eventually to Mars. Human exploration up to this point has relied on continuous communication with short delays. To enable missions with intermittent communication with long delays, new artificially intelligent technologies must be developed in order to keep the crew sizes small. Technologies developed under this subtopic are expected to be suitable for testing on Earth analogues of deep space spacecraft as well as the Deep Space Gateway envisioned by NASA.","

Focus Area 3 Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration,S5.05Fault Management Technologies, JPL," ARC, MSFC", 2021,"Development, Design, and Implementation of Fault Management Technologies","NASA’s science program has well over 100 spacecraft in operation, formulation, or development, generating science data accessible to researchers everywhere. As science missions have increasingly complex goals—often on compressed timetables—and have more pressure to reduce operations costs, system autonomy must increase in response. Fault Management (FM) is a key component of system autonomy, serving to detect, interpret, and mitigate failures that threaten mission success. Robust FM must address the full range of hardware failures, and also must consider failure of sensors or the flow of sensor data, harmful or unexpected system interaction with the environment, and problems due to faults in software or incorrect control inputs—including failure of autonomy components themselves.Despite lessons learned from past missions, spacecraft failures are still not uncommon and reuse of FM approaches is limited, illustrating deficiencies in our approach to handling faults in all phases of the flight project lifecycle. While this subtopic addresses particular interest in onboard FM capabilities (viz. onboard sensing approaches, computing, algorithms, and models to assess and maintain spacecraft health), the goal isto provide a system capability for management of future spacecraft.Offboard components such as modeling techniques and tools, development environments, and verification and validation (V&V) technologies are also relevant, provided they contribute to novel or capable on-board fault management. Needed innovations in FM can be grouped into the following two categories:Fault Management Operations Approaches: This category encompasses FM ""in-the-loop,"" including algorithms, computing, state estimation/classification, machine learning, and model-based reasoning. Further research into fault detection and diagnosis, prognosis, fault recovery, and mitigation of unrecoverable faults is needed to realize greater system autonomy. Fault Management Design and Implementation Tools: Also sought are methods to formalize and optimize onboard FM, such as model-based system engineering (MBSE). New technologies to improve or guarantee fault coverage, manage and streamline complex FM, and system modeling and analysis significantly contribute to the quality of FM design and may prove decisive in trades of new versus traditional FM approaches. Automated test case development, false positive/false negative test tools, model V&V tools, and test coverage risk assessments are examples of contributing technologies.Specific algorithms and sensor technologies are in scope, provided their impact is not limited to a particular subsystem, mission goal, or failure mechanism. Novel artificial-intelligence-inspired algorithms, machine learning, etc., should apply to this and only this subtopic if their design or application is specific to detection, classification, or mitigation of system faults and off-nominal system behavior.While the core interests of this subtopic are spacecraft resilience and enabling spacecraft autonomy, closed-loop FM for other high-value systems such as launch vehicles and test stands is also in scope, particularly if techniques can be easily adapted to spacecraft. Related technologies, but without a primary focus on resolution of system faults, such as machine-learning approaches to spacecraft characterization or science data preprocessing, autonomy architectures, or generalized system modeling and design tools, should be directed to other subtopics such as S5.03, Accelerating NASA Science and Engineering through the Application of Artificial Intelligence, or S5.04, Integrated Science Mission Modeling. Expected outcomes and objectives of this subtopic are to mature the practice of FM, leading to better estimation and control of FM complexity and development costs, more flexible and effective FM designs, and accelerated infusion into future missions through advanced tools and techniques. Specific objectives include the following:Increased spacecraft resilience against faults and failures. Increased spacecraft autonomy through greater onboard fault estimation and response capability. Increase collection and quality of science data through mitigation of interruptions and fault tolerance. Enable cost-effective FM design architectures and operations. Determine completeness and appropriateness of FM designs and implementations. Decrease the labor and time required to develop and test FM models and algorithms. Improve visualization of the full FM design across hardware, software, and operations procedures. Determine extent of testing required, completeness of verification planned, and residual risk resulting from incomplete coverage. Increase data integrity between multidiscipline tools. Standardize metrics and calculations across FM, systems engineering (SE), safety and mission assurance (S&MA), and operations disciplines. Bound and improve costs and implementation risks of FM while improving capability, such that benefits demonstrably outweigh the risks, leading to mission infusion.",3 to 4,"Level 1: TX 10 Autonomous Systems

Prototype
Software","The aim of the Phase I project should be to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the proposed innovation and thereby bring the innovation closer to commercialization. Note, however, the research and development (R&D) undertaken in Phase I is intended to have high technical risk, and so it is expected that not all projects will achieve the desired technical outcomes.The required deliverable at the end of an SBIR Phase I contract is a report that summarizes the project’s technical accomplishments. As noted above, it is intended that proposed efforts conduct an initial proof of concept, after which successful efforts would be considered for follow-on funding by Science Mission Directorate (SMD) missions as risk-reduction and infusion activities. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and NASA relevance during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration.The Final Report should thoroughly document the innovation, its status at the end of the effort, and as much objective evaluation of its strengths and weaknesses as is practical. The report should include a description of the approach, foundational concepts and operating theory, mathematical basis, and requirements for application. Results should include strengths and weaknesses found, measured performance in tests where possible.Additional deliverables may significantly clarify the value and feasibility of the innovation. These deliverables should be planned to demonstrate retirement of development risk, increasing maturity, and targeted applications of particular interest. Although the wide range of innovations precludes a specific list, some possible deliverables are listed below:For innovations that are algorithmic in nature this could include development code or prototype applications, demonstrations of capability, and results of algorithm stress-testing. For innovations that are procedural in nature, this may include sample artifacts such as workflows, model prototypes and schema, functional diagrams, examples, or tutorial applications. Where a suitable test problem can be found, documentation of the test problem and a report on test results, illustrating the nature of the innovation in a quantifiable and reproducible way. Test reports should discuss maturation of the technology, implementation difficulties encountered and overcome, and results and interpretation.Phase II proposals require at minimum a report describing the technical accomplishments of the Phase I award and how these results support the underlying commercial opportunity. Describing the commercial potential is best done through experiment: Ideally the Phase II report should describe results of a prototype implementation to a relevant problem, along with lessons learned and future work expected to adapt the technology to other applications. Further demonstration of commercial value and advantage of the technology can be accomplished through steps such as the following:Delivery of the technology in software form, as a reference application, or through providence of trial or evaluation materials to future customers. Technical manuals, such as functional descriptions, specifications, and users guides. Conference papers or other publications. Establishment of a preliminary performance model describing technology metrics and requirements.Each of these measures represents a step taken to mature the technology and further reduce the difficulty in reducing it to practice. Although it is established that further development and customization will continue beyond Phase II, ideally at the conclusion of Phase II a potential customer should have access to sufficient materials and evidence to make informed project decisions about technology suitability, benefits, and risks.","Many recent SMD missions have encountered major cost overruns and schedule slips due to difficulty in implementing, testing, and verifying FM functions. These overruns are invariably caused by a lack of understanding of FM functions at early stages in mission development and by FM architectures that are not sufficiently transparent, verifiable, or flexible enough to provide needed isolation capability or coverage. In addition, a substantial fraction of SMD missions continue to experience failures with significant mission impact, highlighting the need for better FM understanding early in the design cycle, more comprehensive and more accurate FM techniques, and more operational flexibility in response to failures provided by better visibility into failures and system performance. Furthermore, SMD increasingly selects missions with significant operations challenges, setting expectations for FM to evolve into more capable, faster-reacting, and more reliable onboard systems.The SBIR program is an appropriate venue because of the following factors:Traditional FM design has plateaued, and new technology is needed to address emerging challenges. There is a clear need for collaboration and incorporation of research from outside the spaceflight community, as fielded FM technology is well behind the state of the art and failing to keep pace with desired performance and capability. The need for new FM approaches spans a wide range of missions, from improving operations for relatively simple orbiters to enabling entirely new concepts in challenging environments. Development of new FM technologies by SMD missions themselves is likely to produce point solutions with little opportunity for reuse and will be inefficient at best compared to a focused, disciplined research effort external to missions. SBIR level of effort is appropriately sized to perform intensive studies of new algorithms, new approaches, and new tools. The approach of this subtopic is to seek the right balance between sufficient reliability and cost appropriate to each mission type and associated risk posture. This is best achieved with small and targeted investigations, enabled by captured data and lessons learned from past or current missions, or through examination of knowledge capture and models of missions in formulation. Following this initial proof of concept, successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be considered for follow-on funding by SMD missions as risk-reduction and infusion activities. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and NASA relevance during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration.","FM technologies are applicable to all SMD missions, albeit with different emphases. Medium-to-large missions have very low tolerance for risk of mission failure, leading to a need for sophisticated and comprehensive FM. Small missions, on the other hand, have a higher tolerance for risks to mission success but must be highly efficient, and are increasingly adopting autonomy and FM as a risk mitigation strategy. A few examples are provided below, although these may be generalized to a broad class of missions:Lunar Flashlight (currently in assembly, test, and launch operations (ATLO), as an example of many similar future missions): Enable very low-cost operations and high science return from a 6U CubeSat through onboard error detection and mitigation, streamlining mission operations. Provide autonomous resilience to onboard errors and disturbances that interrupt or interfere with science observations. Europa Lander: Provide onboard capability to detect and correct radiation-induced execution errors. Provide reliable reasoning capability to restart observations after interruptions without requiring ground in-the-loop. Provide MBSE tools to model and analyze FM capabilities in support of design trades, V&V of FM capabilities, and coordinated development with flight software. Maximize science data collection during an expected short mission lifetime due to environmental challenges. Rovers and Rotorcraft (Mars Sample Return, Dragonfly): Provide onboard capability for systems checkout, enabling lengthy drives/flights between Earth contacts and mobility after environmentally induced anomalies (e.g., unexpected terrain interaction). Improve reliability of complex activities (e.g., navigation to features, drilling and sample capture, capsule pickup and remote launch). Search for Extrasolar Planets (observation): Provide sufficient system reliability through onboard detection, reasoning, and response to enable long-period, stable observations. Provide onboard or onground analysis capabilities to predict system response and optimize observation schedule. Enable reliable operations while out of direct contact (e.g., deliberately occluded from Earth to reduce photon, thermal, and radio-frequency background).","

Large swarms and other platforms are of interest if well motivated in connection to NASA’s Strategic Plan and needs identified in decadal surveys.The proposed technology must be motivated by a well-defined ""design reference mission"" presented in the proposal with clear connection to the needs identified in decadal surveys. The proposed design reference mission is used to derive the high-level requirements for the technology development effort.Areas of high interest are:Distributed estimation for exploration and inspection of a target object or phenomena by various assets with heterogenous sensors and from various vantage points. High-precision relative localization and time synchronization in orbit and on planet surface. Operations concepts and tools that provide situational awareness and commanding capability for a team of spacecraft or swarm of robots on another planet.

Additional information on the CLPS program and providers can be found at this link: https://www.nasa.gov/content/commercial-lunar-payload-services. CLPS missions will typically carry multiple payloads for multiple customers. Smaller, simpler, and more self-sufficient payloads are more easily accommodated and would be more likely to be considered for a NASA-sponsored flight opportunity. Commercial payload delivery services may begin as early as 2020 and flight opportunities are expected to continue well into the future. In future years, it is expected that larger and more complex payloads will be accommodated.

Focus Area 3 Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration,T10.04Autonomous Systems and Operations for the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway, ARC," JSC, KSC, SSC", 2021,Artificial Intelligence for the Gateway Lunar Orbital Platform,"Gateway is a planned lunar-orbit spacecraft that will have a power and propulsion system, a small habitat for the crew, a docking capability, an airlock, and logistics modules. Gateway is expected to serve as an intermediate way station between the Orion crew capsule and lunar landers as well as a platform for both crewed and uncrewed experiments. Gateway is also intended to test technologies and operational procedures for suitability on long-duration space missions such as a mission to Mars. As such, it will require new technologies such as autonomous systems to run scientific experiments onboard, including biological experiments; perform system health management, including caution and warning; autonomous data management; and other functions. In contrast to the International Space Station, Gateway is much more representative of lunar and deep space missions—for example, the radiation environment.This subtopic solicits autonomy, artificial intelligence, and machine learning technologies to manage and operate engineered systems to facilitate long-duration space missions, with the goal of testing proposed technologies on Gateway. The current concept of operations for Gateway anticipates uncrewed (dormant) periods of up to 9 months. Technologies need to be capable of or enable long-term, mostly unsupervised autonomous operation. While crew are present, technologies need to augment the crew’s abilities, allow more autonomy from Earth-based Mission Control, and learn how to perform or improve their performance of autonomous operations by observing the crew. Additionally, the technologies may need to allow for coordination with the Orion crew capsule, lunar landers, Earth, and their various systems and subsystems.Examples of needs include but are not limited to:Autonomous operations and tending of science payloads, including environmental monitoring and support for live biological samples, and in situ automated analysis of science experiments. Prioritizing data for transmission from Gateway. Given communications limitations, it may be necessary to determine what data can be stored for transmission when greater bandwidth is available, and what data can be eliminated as it will turn out to be useless, based on criteria relevant to the conduct of science and/or maintenance of the physical assets. Alternatively, it may be useful to adaptively compress data for transmission from the Gateway, which could include scientific experiment data and status, voice communications, scientific experiment data and status, and/or systems health management data. Autonomous operations and health management of Gateway. When Gateway is unoccupied, unexpected events or faults may require immediate autonomous detection and response, demonstrating this capability in the absence of support from Mission Control (which is enabling for future Mars missions and time-critical responses in lunar environment as well). Efforts to develop smart habitats will allow long-term human presence on the Moon and Mars such as the Space Technology Research Institutes (https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-two-new-space-tech-research-institutes-for-smart-habitats) are relevant.The deliverables range from research results to prototypes demonstrating various ways that autonomy and artificial intelligence (e.g., automated reasoning, machine learning, and discrete control) can be applied to aspects of Gateway operations and health management individually and/or jointly. As one example, for autonomous biological science experiments, the prototype could include hardware to host live samples for a minimum of 30 days that provide monitoring and environmental maintenance, as well as software to autonomously remedy issues with live science experiments. As another example, software that monitors the Gateway habitat while uncrewed, automatically notifies of any off-nominal conditions, and then, when crew arrive, transitions Gateway from quiescent status to a status capable of providing the crew with life support. As another example, machine learning from the data stream of Gateway sensors to determine anomalous versus nominal conditions and prioritize and compress data communications to Earth.",2 to 6,"Level 1: TX 10 Autonomous Systems

Hardware",Phase I deliverables minimally include a detailed concept for autonomy technology to support Gateway operations such as experiments. Prototypes of software and/or hardware are strongly encouraged. Phase II deliverables will be full technology prototypes that could be subsequently matured for deployment on Gateway.,"The current state of the art in human spaceflight allows for autonomous operations of systems of relatively limited scope, involving only a fixed level of autonomy (e.g., amount of human involvement needed), and learning at most one type of function (e.g., navigation). Gateway will require all operations and health management to be autonomous at different levels (almost fully autonomous when no astronauts are on board versus limited autonomy when astronauts are present), the autonomy to learn from human operations, and the autonomy across all functions. The autonomy will also need to adapt to new missions and new technologies. Proposers should be aware of and consider potential interfaces and interactions such as those between Gateway and smart habitats. Proposers may want to be aware of pertinent related efforts such as those being conducted by the Space Technology Research Institutes.As NASA continues to expand with the eventual goal of Mars missions, the need for autonomous tending of science payloads will grow substantially. In order to address the primary health concerns for crew on these missions, it is necessary to conduct science in the most relevant environment. Acquisition of this type of data will be challenging while the Gateway and Artemis missions are being performed due to limited crewed missions and limited crew time.",Gateway and other space-station-like assets in the future will need the ability to execute an increasingly large number of autonomous operations over longer durations with higher degrees of complexity and less ability to have human intervention due to increasing duration space missions such as missions to Mars.,"

Focus Area 3 Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration,T10.05Integrated Data Uncertainty Management and Representation for Trustworthy and Trusted Autonomy in Space, LaRC," GSFC, JPL", 2021,Integrated Data Uncertainty Management and Representation for Trustworthy and Trusted Autonomy in Space,"Multi-agent Cyber-Physical-Human (CPH) teams in future space missions must include machine agents with a high degree of autonomy. In the context of this subtopic, by “autonomy” we mean the capacity and authority of an agent (human or machine) for independent decision-making and execution in a specified context. We refer to machine agents with these attributes as autonomous systems (AS). In multi-agent CPH teams, humans may serve as remote mission supervisors or as immediate mission teammates, along with AS. AS may function as teammates with specified independence, but under the ultimate human direction. Alternatively, AS may exercise complete independence in decision-making and operations in pursuit of given mission goals; for instance, for control of uncrewed missions for planetary infrastructure development in preparation for human presence, or maintenance and operation of crew habitats during the crew’s absence.In all cases, trustworthiness and trust are essential in CPH teams. The term “trustworthiness” denotes the degree to which the system performs as intended and does not perform prohibited actions in a specified context. “Trust” denotes the degree of readiness by an agent (human or machine) to accept direction or advice from another agent (human or machine), also in a specified context. In common sense terms, trust is a confidence in a system’s trustworthiness, which in turn, is the ability to perform actions with desired outcomes.Because behind every action lies a decision-making problem, trustworthiness of a system can be viewed in terms of the soundness of decision-making by the system participants. Accurate and relevant information forms the basis of sound decision-making. In this subtopic, we focus on data that inform CPH team decision-making, both in human-machine and machine-machine interactions, from two perspectives: the quality of the data and the representation of the data in support of trusted human-machine and machine-machine interactions.We consider data exchanges in multi-agent CPH teams that include AS. Data exchanges in multi-agent teams must be subject to the following conditions:Known data accuracy, noise characteristics, and resolution, as a function of the physical sensors in relevant environments. Known data accuracy, noise characteristics, and resolution as a function of data interpretation if the contributing sensors have a perception component or if data are delivered to an agent via another perception engine (e.g., visual recognition based on deep learning). Known data provenance and integrity. Dynamic anomaly detection in data streams during operations. Comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) of data from a single source. Data fusion and combined UQ, if multiple sources of data are used for decision-making. If data from either a single source or fused data from multiple sources are used for decision-making by an agent (human or machine), the data and the attendant UQ must be transformed into a representation conducive to and productive for decision-making. This may include data filtering, compression, or expansion, among other approaches. UQ must be accompanied by a sensitivity analysis of the mission/operation/action goals with respect to uncertainties in various data, to enable appropriate risk estimation and risk-based decision-making by relevant agents, human or machine. Tools for real-time, a priori, and aposteriori data analysis, with explanations relevant to participating agents. For instance, if machine learning is used for visual data perception in decision-making by humans, methods of interpretable or explainable AI (XAI) may be in order.We note that deep learning and machine learning, in general, are not the chief focus of this subtopic. The techniques are mentioned as an example of tools that may participate in data processing. If such tools are used, the representation of the results to decision-makers (human or machine) must be suitably interpretable and equipped with UQ.Addressing the entire set of the conditions listed above would likely be impractical in a single proposal. Therefore, proposers may offer methods and tools for addressing a subset of conditions.Proposers should offer both a general approach to achieving a chosen subset of the listed conditions and a specific application of the general approach to appropriate data types. The future orbiting or surface stations are potential example platforms, because the environment would include a variety of autonomous systems used for habitat maintenance when the station is uninhabited, continual system health management, crew health, robotic assembly, and cyber security, among other functions. However, the proposers may choose any relevant design reference mission for demonstration of proposed approaches to integrated data uncertainty management and representation, subject to a convincing substantiation of the generalizability and scalability of the approach to relevant practical systems, missions, and environments.",2 to 4,"Level 1: TX 10 Autonomous Systems

Analysis
Software","Since UQ and management in data is an overarching theme in this subtopic, an analysis of uncertainties in the processes and data must be present in all final deliverables, both in Phases I and II.Phase I: For the areas selected in the proposal, the following deliverables would be in order:Thorough but succinct analysis of the state of the art in the proposed area under investigation. Detailed description of the problem used as the context for algorithm development, including substantiation for why this is a representative problem for a set of applications relevant to NASA missions. Detailed description of the approach, including pseudocode, and the attendant design of experiments for testing and evaluation. Hypotheses about the scalability and generalizability of the proposed approach to realistic problems relevant to NASA missions. Preliminary software and process implementation. Preliminary demonstration of the software. Thorough analysis of performance and gaps. Detailed plan for Phase II, including the design reference mission and the attendant technical problem. Items 1 to 8 documented in a final report for Phase I.Phase II:Detailed description and analysis of the design reference mission and the technical problem selected in Phase I, in collaboration with NASA Contracting Officer Representative (COR)/Technical Monitor (TM). Detailed description of the approach/algorithms developed further for application to the Phase II design reference mission and problem, including pseudocode, and the design of experiments for testing and evaluation. Demonstration of the algorithms, software, methods, and processes. Thorough analysis of performance and gaps, including scalability and applicability to NASA missions. Resulting code. Detailed plan for potential Phase III. Items 1 to 5 documented in a final report for Phase II.","Despite progress in real-time data analytics, serious gaps remain that will present an obstacle to the operation of systems in NASA missions that require heavy participation of autonomous systems, both in human-machine teams and in uncrewed environments, whether temporary or permanent. The gaps come under two main categories:Quality of the information based on various data sources—Trustworthiness of the data is essential in making decisions with desired outcomes. This gap can be summarized as the lack of reliable and actionable UQ associated with data, as well as the difficulty of detecting anomalies in data and combining data from disparate sources, ensuring appropriate quality of the result. Representation of the data to decision-makers (human or machine) that is conducive to trustworthy decision-making—We distinguish raw data from useful information of appropriate complexity and form. Transforming data, single-source or fused, into information productive for decision-making, especially by humans, is a challenge.Specific gaps are listed under the Scope Description as conditions the subsets of which must be addressed by proposers.","The technologies developed as a result of this subtopic would be directly applicable to the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), Science Mission Directorate (SMD), Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD), and Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD), as all of these mission directorates are heavy users of data and growing users of autonomous systems. For instance, the Gateway mission will need a significant presence of autonomous systems, as well as human-machine team operations that rely on autonomous systems for habitat maintenance when the station is uninhabited, continual system health management, crew health, robotic assembly, among other functions. Human presence on the Moon surface will require similar functions, as well as future missions to Mars. All trustworthy decision-making relies on trustworthy data. This topic addresses gaps in data trustworthiness, as well as productive data representation to human-machine teams for sound decision-making.The subtopic is also directly applicable to ARMD missions and goals, because future airspace will heavily rely on autonomous systems. Thus, the subtopic is applicable to such projects as Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP)/Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) and Air Traffic Management—eXploration ATM-X. The technologies developed as a result of this subtopic would be applicable to the National Airspace System (NAS) in the near future as well, because of the need to process data related to vehicle and system performance.","

Focus Area 4 Robotic Systems for Space Exploration,"S4.02Robotic Mobility, Manipulation and Sampling", JPL," ARC, GRC, GSFC", 2021,"Robotic Mobility, Manipulation, and Sampling","Technologies for robotic mobility, manipulation, and sampling are needed to enable access to sites of interest as well as acquisition and handling of samples for in situ analysis or return to Earth from planets and other planetary bodies including the moon, Mars, Venus, Ceres, Europa, Titan, Enceladus, comets, and asteroids. Mobility technologies are needed to enable access to steep and rough terrain for planetary bodies where gravity dominates, such as Earth’s Moon and Mars. Wheeled, legged, and aerial solutions are of interest. Wheel concepts with good tractive performance in loose sand while being robust to harsh rocky terrain are of interest. Technologies to enable mobility on small bodies and access to liquid below the surface (e.g., in conduits or deep oceans) are desired, as well as the associated sampling technologies. Manipulation technologies are needed to deploy sampling tools to the surface, transfer samples to in situ instruments and sample storage containers, and hermetically seal sample chambers. Sample acquisition tools are needed to acquire samples on planetary and small bodies through soft and hard materials, including ice. Minimization of mass and ability to work reliably in the harsh mission environment are important characteristics for the tools. Finally, design for planetary protection and contamination control is important for sample acquisition and handling systems. Component technologies for low-mass and low-power systems tolerant to the in situ environment (e.g., temperature, radiation, and dust) are of particular interest. Technical feasibility and value should be demonstrated during Phase I via analysis or prototype demonstration, and a full capability unit of at least TRL 4 should be delivered in Phase II. Proposals should show an understanding of relevant science needs and engineering constraints and present a feasible plan (to include a discussion of challenges and appropriate testing) to fully develop a technology and infuse it into a NASA program. Specific areas of interest include the following (order does not reflect priority):Surface mobility and sampling systems for planets, small bodies, and moons. Near-subsurface sampling tools such as icy-surface drills to 30 cm depth deployed from a manipulator. Subsurface ocean access such as via a deep drill system. Sample handling technologies that minimize cross contamination and preserve mechanical integrity of samples. Pneumatic sample transfer systems and particle flow measurement sensors. Low-mass/power vision systems and processing capabilities that enable fast surface traverse. Active lighting stereo systems for landers and rovers. Force-torque sensors that can operate in cryogenic and high-radiation environments such as Europa. Electromechanical connectors enabling tool change-out in dirty environments. Tethers and tether play-out and retrieval system. Miniaturized flight motor controllers. Cryogenic operation actuators.

Focus Area 4 Robotic Systems for Space Exploration,T7.04Surface Construction, KSC," GRC, MSFC", 2021,Surface Construction,"Surface construction technologies must be developed to support long-term sustainable human presence on the lunar and eventually Martian surfaces. To enable a sustained human presence on the Moon, multiple assets are likely to be landed proximal to each other. While the Apollo landers demonstrated that it is possible to land on an unprepared surface, landing multiple proximal assets under Artemis will pose an unacceptable risk to nearby hardware.For this reason, launch and landing pads are a high initial priority due to significant risks associated with these operations. When a lander vehicle launches or lands on an extraterrestrial body, the rocket engine exhaust plume impinges on the surface and interacts with the regolith, and blast ejecta is created along with associated cratering of the surface. Lunar regolith blast ejecta travels at high velocities (>2,000 m/s) for long distances (kilometers) in a vacuum environment creating hazards for surrounding assets. Ejecta can also impact the bottom of the lander vehicle, risking damage to the engines, thermal insulation, and sensors. Regolith ejecta can enter cislunar space as debris if the ejecta is sufficiently energetic to achieve orbit. The cratering can affect the stability of the landing gear and expose subsurface hazards.As a part of a Launch and Landing Pad (LLP) system, concepts for construction of blast ejecta barriers such as berms, walls, curtains, deflectors, or other solutions are also sought. These blast ejecta barriers will protect the lunar base in the vicinity of the LLP during routine launches and landings and will also provide protection in the event of an anomalous energy release in the lander.Upon the completion of an LLP system, follow-on surface construction projects will reduce risk to other parts of the lunar infrastructure and are expected to include:Stabilized roads and pads to mitigate trafficability and operational risks. Radiation shielding for nuclear power plants. Trenching for cables and other below-grade operations. Site preparation including establishing grade, leveling, compaction, and rock clearing. Unpressurized structures for radiation, thermal, and micrometeoroid protection. Pressurized structures.This subtopic is focused on applied research to enable the design, testing, and verification of civil engineering products suitable for use in lunar surface architecture. New analysis methods and specialized construction equipment will be required to meet the unique lunar environment. The desired outcome of this work is the definition of feasible civil engineering system solutions with associated methods, analysis, structural designs, construction equipment concept prototypes, and concepts of operations.The construction operations shall be robotically competed using indigenous lunar resources to the highest degree possible to minimize crew interaction and minimize the transportation mass from Earth to the Moon. Proposers need to consider operations and hardware designs in a Global Positioning System (GPS-) denied environment for positioning, leveling, and control. In selecting and developing procedures and materials for surface stabilization and landing pad construction, proposers should consider the ability to perform maintenance and repair for long-term operations.For hardware, processes, and operations that require mobility, proposers should define the interface and operation requirements, but may refrain from designing specific mobility units as these may be available through other development activities. Proposers should also specify the interfaces to other lunar systems that might be required such as power, regolith size sorting, beneficiation, etc., and include the source of all feedstocks for construction materials and associated processing required.Proposed techniques can utilize Earth-supplied consumables (such as binders, water, purge gases, etc.) but need to quantify the types and amounts needed for the proposed construction operations. Emphasis should be given to consumables that can eventually be extracted or produced from in situ resources. The proposed lunar methods, materials, and technologies shall be traceable to Mars applications to the highest degree possible. The lunar construction technologies proposed should also contain methodologies for verification of the as-built or finished construction to ensure it will perform as required.Research institute partnering is anticipated to provide analytical, research, and engineering support to the proposers. Examples may include helping apply civil engineering principles and planning methods, identification and development of needed standards or specifications for lunar operations, or the development of analytical and verification methods for the design and prototyping of structures, hardware, and associated software.Specific figures of merit for proposed solutions include the following for Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) and human-class landers:Performance of infrastructure in intended applications (e.g., under launch/landing conditions). Performance under lunar surface environmental conditions (e.g., thermal cycling, ultraviolet (UV), vacuum, and radiation). Required payload mass. Estimated power requirements. Feedstock sources and requirements. Construction time. Surface preparation/analysis requirements. Strategy for verification of as-built structural performance. Concepts of operation. Expected life of infrastructure.All proposals need to identify the state-of-the-art of applicable technologies and processes. Prototypes to be delivered at the conclusion of Phase II will be required to operate under lunar equivalent vacuum, temperature, and dust conditions, so thermal management and dust mitigation strategies utilized during the operation of the proposed technology will need to be specified in the Phase I proposal. The Phase I proposals should at least result in a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 to 4.",2 to 6,"Level 1: TX 07 Exploration Destination Systems

Sintered regolith interlocking pavers and emplacement systems were jointly developed and tested by NASA and the Pacific International Space Center for Exploration Systems (PISCES). Robotic construction of blast ejecta barriers was completed by NASA where a lunar teleoperated robotic bulldozer was able to clear and level an area of 100 by 100 m and then build a 2-m-high berm in the sand dunes of Moses Lake in Washington. Sintered basalt and ablative polymer concrete materials that have been tested at high plasma temperatures in the Arc Jet facility at NASA Ames Research Center performed well as a heat shield material. Specialized concrete formulations and emplacement systems have been developed by Marshall Space Flight Center and others.,"Surface construction of infrastructure directly addresses the STMD Strategic Thrust, “Land: Increase Access to Planetary Surfaces.” It also addresses the strategic thrust of “Explore: Expand Capabilities Through Robotic Exploration and Discovery.” The risks of landing on the Moon were demonstrated in the lunar Surveyor and Apollo missions. The robotic Surveyor spacecraft had difficulty landing safely, and during Apollo, five of six landings had close calls such as avoiding hazardous terrain, dust obscuration during landing, and slopes that tipped the lander as far as 11°, which happened on Apollo 15. The need for trafficability risk mitigation is highlighted by Spirit rover becoming immobilized in Martian regolith. Lunar dust and radiation mitigations are considered major risks for long-term lunar operations.","

Focus Area 4 Robotic Systems for Space Exploration,Z5.04Technologies for Intravehicular Activity Robotics, ARC, JSC, 2021,Improve the Capability or Performance of Intravehicular Activity Robots,"To support human exploration beyond Earth orbit, NASA is developing Gateway, which will be an orbiting facility near the Moon. This facility will serve as a starting point for missions to cislunar space and beyond. It could enable assembly and servicing of telescopes and deep space exploration vehicles. It could also be used as a platform for astrophysics, Earth observation, heliophysics, and lunar science.In contrast to the International Space Station (ISS), which is continuously manned, Gateway is expected to be occupied by humans only intermittently—perhaps only 1 month per year. Consequently, there is a significant need for Gateway to have autonomous capabilities for performing payload operations and spacecraft caretaking, particularly when astronauts are not present. Similar capabilities are needed for future lunar or planetary surface habitats. Intravehicular activity (IVA) robots can potentially perform a wide variety of tasks, including systems inspection, monitoring, diagnostics and repair, logistics and consumables stowage, exploration capability testing, aggregation of robotically returned destination surface samples, and science measurements and operations.The objective of this subtopic is to develop technologies that can improve the capability or performance of IVA robots to perform payload operations and spacecraft caretaking. Proposals are specifically sought to create technologies that can be integrated and tested with the NASA Astrobee, Robonaut 2, or other NASA robots in the following areas:Sensors and perception systems for performing contact tasks; manipulation; and/or interior environment monitoring, inspection, modeling, and navigation. Robotic tools for manipulating logistics and stowage or performing maintenance, housekeeping, or emergency management operations (e.g., fire detection and suppression in multiple constrained locations or cleaning lunar dust out of air filters). Operational subsystems that enable extended robot operations (power systems, efficient propulsion, etc.); increase robot autonomy via computationally efficient methods (planning, scheduling, and task execution); or improve human-robot interaction between IVA robots and human teams on the ground under communications constraints, including low bandwidth and extended loss-of-signal periods (software architecture, remote operations methods, etc.).This subtopic also seeks to advance technologies that will enable the next generation of IVA robots to operate in lunar surface habitats, including:Novel robotic end effectors capable of reliably performing fine grasping tasks, such as plugging and unplugging MIL-STD-38999 electrical connectors and fluid quick-disconnect connectors. Compact, reliable, modular robotic actuators and controllers for IVA robots. Software that enables autonomous management of robot operational and hardware faults such that the robot can “fail operational.” For example, the software may use algorithms to determine how to automatically respond to a failure in a motion planner for move to a commanded location by taking into account a projected collision and replanning to the next closest point not in collision.",4 to 5,"Level 1: TX 04 Robotics Systems

Phase II awards shall deliver demonstration reports along with supporting software, design information, and documentation.","The technology developed by this subtopic would both enable and enhance the Astrobee free-flying robot and Robonaut 2 humanoid robot, which are the state of the art for IVA robots.

New technology created by 2021 SBIR awards could potentially be tested with these, or other, robots in ground testbeds at Ames Research Center (ARC) and Johnson Space Center (JSC) in follow-on awards. Likewise, on-orbit testing on ISS may be possible during follow-on awards.The technology developed by this subtopic would also fill technical gaps identified by the proposed Game Changing Development (GCD) Integrated System for Autonomous and Adaptive Caretaking (ISAAC) project, which will mature autonomy technology to support the caretaking of human exploration spacecraft.

Hardware
Software","For all technologies lowest cost for small volume production (5 to 20 units) is a driver. Research must convincingly prove technical feasibility (proof of concept) during Phase I, ideally with hardware deliverables that can be tested to validate performance claims, with a clear path to demonstrating and delivering functional hardware meeting all objectives and specifications in Phase II.","The state of the art (SOA) for FSOC can be subdivided into near-Earth (extending to cislunar and translunar distances) and planetary ranges with the Lagrange points falling in between.Near-Earth FSOC technology has matured through a number of completed and upcoming technology demonstrations from space. Transition from technology demonstration to an operational service demands low-SWaP, novel high-speed (10 to 100 Gbps) space-qualified laser transmitters and receivers. Transmitters and receivers servicing near-Earth applications can possibly be repurposed for deep-space proximity links, such as landed assets on planetary surfaces to orbiting assets with distances of 5,000 to 100,000 km or inter-satellite links. Innovative light-weight space-qualified modems for handling multiple optical-modulation schemes. Emerging photonics technologies that can benefit space FSOC applications are sought.Deep space FSOC is motivated by NASA's initiative to send humans to Mars. Critical gaps following a successful technology demonstration will be light-weighted 30- to 50-cm optical transceivers with a wide operational temperature range -20 to 50 °C over which wave-front error and focus is stable; high peak-to-average power space qualified lasers with average powers of 20 to 50 W; and single photon-sensitive radiation-hardened flight detectors with high-detection efficiency, fast rise times, and low-timing jitter. The detector size should be able to cover 1 mrad FOV with an instantaneous FOV comparable to the transmitted laser beam width. Laser pointing control systems that operate with dim laser beacons transmitted from Earth or use celestial beacon sources. For Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC) ground laser transmitters with high-average power (kW class) but narrow line-widths (<0.25 nm) and high-variable repetition rates are required. Innovative optical coatings for large aperture mirrors that are compatible with near-Sun pointing applications for efficiently collecting the signal and lowering background and stray light. Reliability through space-qualified materials and component selection and implementation of redundancy are highly sought after to enable sending humans to planetary destinations, as well as enable higher resolution science instruments. Deriving auxiliary optimetrics from the FSOC signals to support laser ranging and time transfer will also be critical for providing services to future human missions to Mars. High-rate uplink from the ground to Mars with high-modulation rate high-power lasers are also currently lacking.","A number of FSOC-related NASA projects are ongoing with launch expected in the 2019-2022 time frame. The Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD) is an Earth-to-geostationary satellite relay demonstration to launch in 2021. The Illuma-T Project will follow to extend the relay demonstration to include a low Earth orbit (LEO) node on the International Space Station (ISS). In 2023, the Optical to Orion (O2O), Artemis II, demonstration will transmit data from the Orion crewed capsule as it performs a translunar trajectory and return to Earth.In 2022, the DSOC Project technology demonstration will be hosted by the Psyche Mission spacecraft extending FSOC links to AU distances.These missions are being funded by NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) Technology Demonstrations Mission (TDM) program and Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Program.Of the 6 technologies recently identified by NASA for sending humans to Mars, laser communications was identified (https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/6_Technologies_NASA_is_Advancing_to_Send_Humans_to_Mars)","

With the incorporation of the Space Fence and the deployment of large constellations, the number of objects tracked and assessed for conjunctions is expected to greatly increase. This presents a critical gap in which current approaches may not suffice. Thus, smarter ways to perform conjunction analysis and assessments such as methods for bundling events and performing ensemble risk assessment, middle-duration risk assessment (longer duration than possible for discrete events but shorter than decades-long analyses that use gas dynamics assumptions), improved CA event evolution prediction, and AI/ML applied to CA risk assessment parameters and/or event evolution are needed. The decision space for collision avoidance relies on not only the quality of the data (state and covariance) but also the tools and techniques for CA.Collision avoidance maneuver decisions are based on predicted close approach distance and probability of collision. The accuracy of these numbers depend on underlying measurements and mathematics used in estimation. Current methods assume Gaussian distributions for errors and that all objects are shaped like cannon balls for nongravitational force computations. These assumptions and others cause inaccurate estimates that can lead decision makers to perform unnecessary collision avoidance maneuvers, thus wasting propellant. Better techniques are needed for orbit prediction and covariance characterization and propagation. Better modeling of nongravitational force effects is needed to improve orbit prediction. Modeling of nongravitational forces relies on knowledge of individual object characteristics.","This technology is relevant and needed for all human spaceflight and robotic missions in the near-Earth, cislunar, and lunar environments. The ability to perform CARA more accurately will improve space safety for all near-Earth operations, improve operational support by providing more accurate and longer term predictions, and reduce propellant usage for collision avoidance maneuvers.","

Focus Area 5 Communications and Navigation,H9.07Cognitive Communication, GRC," GSFC, JPL", 2021,Lunar Cognitive Capabilities,"NASA's Space Communication and Navigation (SCaN) program seeks innovative approaches to increase mission science data return, improve resource efficiencies for NASA missions and communication networks, and ensure resilience in the unpredictable space environment. The Cognitive Communication subtopic specifically focuses on advances in space communication driven by onboard data processing and modern space networking capabilities. A cognitive system is envisioned to sense, detect, adapt, and learn from its experiences and environment to optimize the communications capabilities for the user mission satellite or network infrastructure. The underlying need for these technologies is to reduce both the mission and network operations burden. Examples of these cognitive capabilities include:Link technologies—reconfiguration and autonomy, maximizing use of bandwidth while avoiding interference. Network technologies—robust intersatellite links, data storage/forwarding, multinode routing in unpredictable environments. System technologies—optimal scheduling techniques for satellite and surface relays in distributed and real-time environments.Through Space Policy Directive-1, NASA is committed to landing American astronauts on the Moon by 2024. In support of this goal, cognitive communication techniques are needed for lunar communication satellite and surface relays. Cognitive agents operating on lunar elements will manage communication, provide diagnostics, automate resource scheduling, and dynamically update data flow in response to the types of data flowing over the lunar network. Goals of this capability are to improve communications efficiency, mitigate channel impairments, and reduce operations complexity and cost through intelligent and autonomous communications and data handling. Examples of research and/or technology development include:Onboard processing technology and techniques to enable data switching, routing, storage, and processing on a relay spacecraft. Data-centric, decentralized network data routing and scheduling techniques that are responsive to quality of service metrics. Simultaneous wideband sensing and communications for S-, X-, and Ka-bands, coupled with algorithms that learn from the environment. Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms applied to optimize space communication links, networks, or systems. Flexible communication platforms with novel signal processing technology to support cognitive approaches. Other innovative, related areas of interest to the field of cognitive communications.Proposals to this subtopic should consider application to a lunar communications architecture consisting of surface assets (e.g., astronauts, science stations, and surface relays), lunar communication relay satellites, Gateway, and ground stations on Earth. The lunar communication relay satellites require technology with low-size, -weight, and -power (-SWaP) attributes suitable for small satellite (e.g., 50 kg) or CubeSat operations. Proposed solutions should highlight advancements to provide the needed communications capability while minimizing use of onboard resources, such as power and propellant. Proposals should consider how the technology can mature into a successful demonstration in the lunar architecture.",4 to 6,"Level 1: TX 05 Communications, Navigation, and Orbital Debris Tracking and Characterization Systems

Phase I deliverables include a feasibility assessment and concept of operations of the research topic, simulations and/or measurements, validation of the proposed approach to develop a given product (TRL 3 to 4) and a plan for further development of the specific capabilities or products to be performed in Phase II. Early development, integration, test, and delivery prototype hardware/software is encouraged.Phase II will emphasize hardware/software development with delivery of specific hardware or software product for NASA targeting demonstration operations on a small satellite or CubeSat platform.

Intelligent radio systems will help manage the increased complexity and provide greater capability to the mission to return more science data.... Reconfigurable radio systems...could autonomously optimize the RF [radio-frequency] links, network protocols, and modes used based on the needs of the various mission phases. A cognitive radio system would sense its RF environment and adapt and learn from its various configuration changes to optimize the communications links throughout the system in order to maximize science data transfer, enable substantial efficiencies, and reduce latency. The challenges in this area are in the efficient integration of different capabilities and components, unexpected radio or system decisions or behavior, and methods to verify decision-making algorithms as compared to known, planned performance.""The technology need for the lunar communication architecture includes:Data routing from surface assets to a lunar communication relay satellite, where data is unscheduled, a-periodic, and ad-hoc. Data routing between lunar relay satellites, as necessary, to conserve power, route data to Earth, and meet quality of service requirements. Efficient use of lunar communication spectrum while coexisting with future/current interference sources. On-demand communication resource scheduling. Multihop, delay tolerant routing.Critical gaps between the state of the art and the technology need include:Implementation of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques on SWaP-constrained platforms. Integrated wide-band sensing and narrow-band communication on the same radio terminal. Intersatellite networking and routing, especially in unpredictable and unscheduled environments. On-demand scheduling technology for communication links. Cross-layer optimization approaches for optimum communication efficiency at a system level.","Cognitive technologies are critical for the lunar communications architecture. The majority of lunar operations will be run remotely from Earth, which could require substantial coordination and planning as NASA, foreign space agencies, and commercial interests all place assets on the Moon. As lunar communications and networks become more complex, cognition and automation are essential to mitigate complexity and reduce operations costs. Machine learning will configure networks, choose radio configurations, adjust for impairments and failures, and monitor short- and long-term performance for improvements.","

This subtopic covers mission-enabling technologies that have significant size, weight and power, cost, and performance (SWaP-CP) improvements over the state-of-the-art commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) capabilities in the areas of S, Absolute and Relative Navigation Systems, and Pointing Control Systems, and Radiation-Hardened Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) Hardware.Component technology developments are sought for the range of flight sensors, actuators, and associated algorithms and software required to provide these improved capabilities. Technologies that apply to most spacecraft platform sizes will be considered.Advances in the following areas are sought:Spacecraft Attitude Determination and Control Systems: Sensors and actuators that enable <0.1 arcsecond-level pointing knowledge and arcsecond-level control capabilities for large space telescopes, with improvements in size, weight, and power requirements. Absolute and Relative Navigation Systems: Autonomous onboard flight navigation sensors and algorithms incorporating both spaceborne and ground-based absolute and relative measurements. For relative navigation, machine vision technologies apply. Special considerations will be given to relative navigation sensors enabling precision formation flying, astrometric alignment of a formation of vehicles, robotic servicing and sample return capabilities, and other GNC techniques for enabling the collection of distributed science measurements.In addition, flight sensors and algorithms that support onboard terrain relative navigation are of interest. Pointing Control Systems: Mechanisms that enable milliarcsecond-class pointing performance on any spaceborne pointing platforms. Active and passive vibration isolation systems, innovative actuation feedback, or any such technology that can be used to enable other areas within this subtopic applies. Radiation-Hardened Hardware: GNC sensors that could operate in a high radiation environment, such as the Jovian environment.Increasing the fundamental precision of gyroscopes and accelerometers that utilize optical cavities could benefit autonomous navigation and open up new science possibilities. Two strategies may be pursued to increase the precision. First, can the scale factor be increased without a concomitant increase in the quantum noise? Possible approaches include but are not limited to: (a) the use of fiber optics to increase cavity length without increasing SWaP and (b) exploitation of the degeneracies known as exceptional points (EPs) that occur in non-Hermitian systems. Prominent examples of such systems include parity-time symmetric systems and cavities containing a fast-light medium. It remains to be seen, however, whether the boost in scale factor near an EP can result in increased precision or is entirely counteracted by additional quantum noise. Proposals are sought that seek to answer this question through theoretical or experimental means in passive and active systems, including continuous-wave and pulsed lasers. Second, can the quantum noise be reduced without a concomitant reduction in scale factor? The frequency measurement in a laser gyro or accelerometer only involves the uncertainty in phase. Therefore, the relevant quantum noise might be reduced by squeezing. Proposals are sought that investigate and utilize squeezing, for example via the propagation of quantum solitons, for the improvement of inertial sensors.Proposals should show an understanding of one or more relevant science or exploration needs and present a feasible plan to fully develop a technology and infuse it into a NASA program.This subtopic is for all mission-enabling GNC technology in support of Science Mission Directorate (SMD) missions and future mission concepts.

However, the sensitivity of current gene-based microbial detection systems is low (~100 gene copies per reaction), requires elaborate sample process steps, involves destructive analyses, and requires fluids to be transferred and detection systems are relatively large size. Recent advancements in the metabolomics field have potential to substitute (or augment) current gene-based microbial detection technologies that are multistepped, destructive, and labor intensive (e.g., significant crew time). NASA is soliciting nongene-based microbial detection technologies and systems that target microbial metabolites and that quantify the microbial burden of surfaces, air, and water inside for long-duration deep-space habitats.Potable water:A simple integrated, microbial sensor system that enables sample collection, processing, and detection of microbes or microbial activity of the crew potable water supply is sought.

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,H3.05Additive Manufacturing for Adsorbent Bed Fabrication, ARC," JSC, MSFC", 2021,Additive Manufacturing for Adsorbent Bed Fabrication,"Current state-of-the-art (SOA) Air Revitalization System (ARS) contaminant-removal systems utilize packed beds. Packed beds have high pressure drop, large void volumes, poor heat management, and poor mechanical stability. Some alternate sorbent technologies (e.g., structural sorbent and monolith) have been proposed previously, but they are at a low TRL and require additional research and development to prove the concepts and resolve scale-up issues. Using robocasting techniques, a type of 3D paste printing, sorbent pastes are used to print sorbent beds with custom flow paths and rod size. With this approach, sorbent beds can be designed and fabricated with controlled pressure drop, tailored flow path, minimized void spaces, good heat management, high mechanical and chemical stability, and optimized structures with high mass transfer. In addition, having the ability to formulate one’s own sorbent paste materials allows variability in binders and co-binder selections for optimal contaminant removal and thermal performance. Previous studies have been completed for a variety of sorbent pastes (activated carbon [Ref. 1], zeolite 13X [Ref. 2], 5A, 4A, polymer, amine functionalized zeolite [Ref. 3], etc.). However, these works did not focus on optimizing the printed structure for cyclic operation and addressing scale-up issues.NASA aims to use the 3D-printed sorbent beds as drop-in replacements for packed sorbent beds such as those found in the Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) on the International Space Station (ISS). Using robocasting techniques to print scale-up sorbent beds is also at a low TRL and requires additional development. However, it is the preferred technique over other options (e.g., structured sorbents) because, if successful, the resulting technology will yield equivalent system mass reduction due to better thermal and fluid management and mass transfer properties. Technology solutions could include, but not be limited to, SOA solid sorbent materials such as zeolite 13X, zeolite 5A, silica gel, metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs), and activated carbon. All proposed technologies should address issues related to scale-up, paste formulation, printability, mechanical and hydrothermal stability, system design, and heaters integration. The components used in the paste formulation must abide by spacecraft chemical safety standards. This subtopic is open for novel ideas that address any of the numerous technical challenges listed below for the design and fabrication of printed sorbent beds for humidity and/or CO2 removal. This subtopic does not seek new sorbent chemistries, instead, zeolite paste formulation and paste printing are desired.Innovative concepts on how to make silica gel paste for use in removing water from air, either in a cabin humidity control system or as part of a CO2 removal process requiring desiccation. Choosing the correct paste formulation for optimal and mechanical stability. Designing the lattice structures to minimize pressure drop, provide large surface area for mass transfer, and prevent channeling. Designing a heater system for thermal regeneration of the sorbent that would minimize contact resistance between heater and sorbent and minimize mass while providing a uniform temperature throughout the bed. Heaters could be commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) types (e.g. cartridge or Kapton® heaters) or they could be 3D printed.NASA is especially interested in technologies that can be incorporated into closed-loop life-support systems. Three life-support functions of particular Interest are CO2 removal, cabin humidity control, and trace contaminant control, as solid sorbents are particularly suited to these applications. Technologies targeting other NASA life-support functions are also of interest.Proposals targeting CO2 removal applications should consider the following:Improvements in sorbent CO2 capacity and selectivity leading to smaller, more efficient components, lower energy consumption, and operation at lower CO2 partial pressures are highly desirable. Increases in the robustness of sorbent materials to mechanical stresses and temperature and humidity changes/cycling. Full-scale systems must achieve the following performance targets: CO2 removal rate of 4.16 kg/day (a 4-crew load). System must maintain an environment with 3.0 mmHg ppCO2 for cabin applications (based on the daily average ppCO2). System size ≤0.3 m3 for a 4-crew system. Average system power ≤500 W of power for a 4-crew system. System mass of ≤450 kg for the 4-person load. System must effectively separate out water vapor from cabin air (less than 100 ppm water vapor in the CO2 product is desired).System must effectively separate out oxygen and nitrogen from cabin air (less than 1% O2 and 2% N2 by volume in the CO2 product is desired).",1 to 3,"Level 1: TX 06 Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation Systems

The SOA systems (CDRA, the Carbon Dioxide Reduction Assembly (CRA), and the Trace Contaminant Control System (TCCS) are adsorbent-based or catalyst-based and their performances are limited because they use COTS sorbent materials. COTS sorbent pellets/beads have fixed performance parameters (e.g., mass transfer capability), which limit the ability to tailor the sorbents to meet specific needs. Spacecraft system design requirements differ from those used in industry. For example, one industrial application focuses on removing carbon dioxide at a relatively high concentration (12% from flue gas), whereas CDRA focuses on removing carbon dioxide at low partial pressure (3 mmHg). Therefore, having the ability to tailor a sorbent to NASA objectives would lead to more efficient adsorbent systems not just for the ARS but also other life support systems that utilize sorbents (e.g., the multifiltration beds). In addition, often times COTS sorbents are sold in bulk (impractical for NASA-scale systems) and become obsolete when manufacturers cease production. Instead of having to reevaluate and redesign systems for new COTS materials to address obsolescence, NASA can use a well-characterized 3D-printed sorbent formulation to remake or even to improve SOA systems. Here, having control over the formulation of these materials could mean continuity in the use of the materials as well and an ability to optimize and tailor the materials for spacecraft use. In addition, as new materials are available for use, (e.g., MOFs), these materials can be adapted using the same 3D-printed design. That is, once the lattice and heater designs are completed, the backbone may be used for other sorbent materials. Moreover, the 3D printing can be done commercially once an acceptable paste formulation has been established. Sorbent paste printing techniques need additional technology investment to reach a level of maturity necessary for consideration for use in a flight Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS). This approach offers high returns and is a paradigm shift from the SOA, as it offers the ability to control flow paths, thermal management, and mass transfer properties.","This technology could be a drop-in replacement for the current CO2 adsorption beds and can be proven on the ISS with potential for application in long-duration human exploration missions, including Gateway, Lunar surface, and Mars, including surface and transit. It is imperative that CO2 be removed to support human life during space missions. This subtopic is supported by the Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) Program in an effort to improve the SOA ARS in the ECLSS.","

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,H3.07Flame-Retardant Textiles for Intravehicular Activities (IVA), JSC, GRC, 2021,Flame-Retardant Textiles for Crew Clothing and for Use in Spacecraft Cabins,"There is a textile technology gap for apparel fabrics for lunar and planetary human exploration. While there are industrial fabrics that are flame retardant in oxygen-enriched atmospheres up to 100% at ambient pressure, there is no apparel or furnishing fabric that is flame retardant in enriched atmosphere of 36% oxygen at a pressure of 8.2 psi (56.5 kPa). The challenge for developing next-to-the-skin flame-retardant fabrics comes from the many other requirements these fabrics must satisfy. They must be comfortable. This means they must have high drape, be soft to the touch, and have no inherent unpleasant smell. In addition, they cannot be toxic through the skin or outgas toxic chemicals. These fabrics must be washable and durable over a period of up to three years of repeated use. In other words, these fabrics must have physical and mechanical properties (no static cling, color fastness, tensile strength and elongation dry and wet, tear resistance, bending stiffness, torsional stiffness, abrasion resistance, etc.) that make them suitable for use in T-shirts and pants to be worn in an atmosphere containing 36% oxygen. NASA needs such new fabrics to send astronauts to the Moon in order to later establish a sustainable human presence beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) or on the Moon, and in preparation for a future trip to Mars.The gap in textile technology that affects IVA results from the need to protect astronauts inside space vehicles and space habitats with atmosphere of 34 ± 2% oxygen at a pressure of 8.2 psi (56.5 kPa). During the period the astronauts reside in the Lunar Lander, they will need fire protection provided by their clothing as they will not continuously wear their space suits during the entire period the lander is on the Moon.",1 to 3,"Level 1: TX 06 Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation Systems

Analysis
Prototype","In Phase I, the deliverable should be a report demonstrating the feasibility to produce new flame-retardant, nontoxic apparel fibers and/or finishing treatments on existing fibers that do not support combustion in an atmosphere of 36% oxygen at a pressure of 8.2 psi. The chemical process for developing a synthetic fiber or a finishing treatment, including any test results, should be fully described to understand any toxicity issue related to processing. Furthermore, the researchers should describe the rheological, physical, and mechanical properties of the new fiber or finishing treatment and explain how these properties will make these fibers suitable for apparel applications.In Phase II, the deliverable should be a fiber that can withstand the production processes used in the textile industry. The researchers should therefore process the new fiber and experiment with different processing conditions to determine which conditions will lead to consistent results that will enable scaling-up production. In other words, the researchers must demonstrate that they can make fine yarns that will not break or produce excessive lint when woven into fabrics. It is highly desirable that samples of fabrics be developed and evaluated.","The state of the art in flame-retardant apparel fibers and fabrics for use next to the skin is mostly represented by meta-aramids, modacrylic, and flame-retardant (FR) fibers (FR rayon, FR wool, etc.). These fibers will not support combustion in air, but they burn in an atmosphere of 36% oxygen.The critical gap is the absence of an inherently strong, flame-retardant (in 36% oxygen), nontoxic, and comfortable fiber to use for next-to-the-skin clothing.","This work will benefit several space programs, namely the lunar Human Landing System (HLS), Orion, Gateway, and Artemis, enabling the astronauts to function in habitats, pressurized rovers, and other space vehicles with enriched oxygen atmospheres and to shorten prebreathe times prior to extravehicular activities (EVAs).","

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,T6.06Enabling Spacecraft Water Monitoring through Nanotechnology, JSC," ARC, GRC, JPL, KSC, MSFC", 2021,Monitoring Systems for Inorganic and Organic Analytes in Spacecraft Water Streams,"This subtopic solicits for technologies that fill specific gaps in capabilities needed for spacecraft water management in the area of environmental monitoring. Its focus is on technologies that identify and quantify inorganic and organic species in water for use during long-duration human missions away from Earth. This subtopic is aligned with the thrust ""Enabling Next-Generation Water Monitoring Systems with Nanotechnology,"" described within a white paper of the Nanotechnology Signature Initiative (NSI) ""Water Sustainability through Nanotechnology.""NASA is seeking miniature analytical systems to measure mineral and organic constituents in potable water and wastewater. NASA is interested in sensor suites capable of simultaneous measurement of inorganic or organic species. There is interest in the capability for monitoring species within wastewater, regenerated potable water, thermal control system cooling water, and samples generated from science activities and biomedical operations. Potential wastewater streams, both current and possible in the future, include urine, urine brines, humidity condensate, Sabatier and Bosch product water, wastewater from hygiene, and wastewater from laundry. Multispecies analyte measurement capability is of interest that would provide a similar capability to that available from standard water monitoring instruments such as ion-chromatography, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy, and high-performance liquid chromatography. Components that enable the miniaturization of these monitoring systems, such as microfluidics and small scale detectors, will also be considered.Technologies should be targeted to have >3-year service life and at least >50% size reduction compared to current state of the art. Ideally, monitoring systems should require no hazardous reagents, have long-term calibration stability, can be recalibrated in flight, require few consumables, and require very little crew time to operate and maintain. The proposed analytical instrument should be compact, require minimal sample preparation, be compatible with microgravity and partial gravity, and be power efficient. Sample volumes should be minimized and should be identified within the proposal.Monitoring capability is of interest for both identification and quantification of organic and inorganic contaminants, including polyatomic ions and unknowns. Examples of species of interest and their levels for measurement are specified in Spacecraft Water Exposure Guidelines (SWEGs), released as JSC 63414 (last revised July 2017). Targeted inorganic compounds identified in the SWEGs for human exploration missions include ammonium, antimony, barium, cadmium, manganese, nickel, silver, and zinc. But there is also interest in measurement of other cations and anions including iron, copper, aluminum, chromium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, arsenic, lead, molybdenum, fluoride, bromide, boron, silicon, lithium, phosphates, sulfates, chloride, iodine, nitrate, and nitrite. Examples of organics include benzene, caprolactam, chloroform, phthalates, dichloromethane, dimethylsilanediol, glycols, aldehydes, formate, 2-mercaptobenzothiozole, alcohols, ketones, and phenol, N-phenyl-beta-naphthylamine.Please see references for additional information, including NASA's water quality requirements and guidelines, and the current state of the art in spacecraft water management, including recycling wastewater.",2 to 4,"Level 1: TX 06 Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation Systems

Hardware should be evaluated through parametric testing prior to shipment. Reports should include design drawings, safety evaluation, and test data and analysis. Prototypes must be full scale unless physical verification in 1g is not possible. Robustness must be demonstrated with long-term operation and with periods of intermittent dormancy. System should incorporate safety margins and design features to provide safe operation upon delivery to a NASA facility.","There is limited capability for water quality analysis onboard current spacecraft. Simple measurements of water composition are made on the ISS during flight, and these are limited to conductivity, total organic carbon and iodine concentration. For identification and characterization of ionic or organic species in water and wastewater, samples currently must be returned to Earth.Water recovery from wastewater sources is considered enabling to long-duration human exploration missions away from Earth. Without substantial water recovery, life support system launch weights are prohibitively large. Regenerative systems are utilized on the International Space Station (ISS) to recycle water from humidity condensate, Sabatier product water, and urine into potable water (see ICES-2019-36 for more information). Several hardware failures have occurred onboard the ISS, which demonstrate the need for in situ measurement of inorganic and organic contaminants (for examples, see ICES-2018-123 and ICES-2018-87). This will be especially important for human exploration missions in deep space where return of samples to Earth for analysis on the ground will be impossible. Spacecraft water analysis capability will also benefit onboard science, biomedical, and spacecraft maintenance operations. It will be necessary to confirm that potable water systems are safe for human use following periods of spacecraft dormancy (ICES-2017-43).NASA has unique water needs in space that have analogous applications on Earth. NASA’s goal is zero-discharge water treatment, targeting 100% water recycling and reuse. NASA’s wastewater collection differs from systems used on Earth in that it is highly concentrated with respect to urine, uses minimal flush water, is separated from solid wastes, and contains highly acidic and toxic pretreatment chemicals. NASA is interested in recovery of potable water from wastewater, low toxicity residual disinfection, antifouling treatments for plumbing lines and tanks, ""microbial check valves"" that prevent microbial cross-contamination where water treatment and potable water systems share connections, and miniaturized sensors and monitoring systems for contaminants in potable water and wastewater. Only the last gap, technologies to monitor contaminants in water, is requested in this subtopic. Spacecraft traveling away from Earth require the capability of a fully functional water analysis laboratory, including identification and quantification of known and unknown inorganic ions, organics, and microbes, as well as pH, conductivity, total organic carbon, and other typical measurements. SWEGs have been published for selected contaminants. Nanotechnology may offer solutions in all of these application areas.","Technologies developed under this subtopic could be proven on the ISS and would be enabling to long-duration human exploration missions away from Earth, including Gateway and exploration of the Moon and Mars, including both surface and transit.This subtopic is directed at needs identified by the Environmental Control and Life Support—Crew Health and Performance Systems Leadership Team (ECLS-CHP SLT) in areas of water management and environmental monitoring.This subtopic is directed at meeting NASA's commitments as a collaborating agency with the National Nanotechnology Signature Initiative: ""Water Sustainability through Nanotechnology.""

This latter concept has been referred to as bioregenerative life support. To do this will require controlled environments for growing the crops, perhaps using techniques similar to recirculating hydroponics used on Earth. But this will require careful monitoring of the environment and the plants themselves to assess their health and performance. In addition, crew time will likely be limited in many space settings, so having the monitoring systems operate autonomously or with little human intervention would be beneficial.This subtopic solicits advanced technologies for remotely sensing the status of plants in controlled environments of space. These environments are typically small in volume, often use narrow band lighting from light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and are subject to reduced gravity.

Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,T6.07Space Exploration Plant Growth, KSC," ARC, JSC", 2021,Biopriming of Plant Microbiome to Promote Crop Health and Growth,"Plant (crop) systems envisioned for future space travel could provide supplemental fresh food for the human crews during early missions and increased amounts of food along with oxygen and carbon dioxide removal for future longer-term missions. This latter concept has been referred to as bioregenerative life support. To do this will require controlled environments for growing the crops, perhaps using techniques similar to recirculating hydroponics used on Earth. But this will require careful monitoring of the environment and the plants themselves to assess their health and performance. In addition, crew time will likely be limited in many space settings, so having the monitoring systems operate autonomously or with little human intervention would be beneficial.This subtopic solicits advanced technologies for remotely sensing the status of plants in controlled environments of space. These environments are typically small in volume, often use narrow band lighting from light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and are subject to reduced gravity. Example methods might include multispectral and hyperspectral sensing of crops, use of bio-indicators in the crops themselves, or other innovative, noninvasive means. Technologies could focus on approaches for (1) monitoring the morphology and growth of plants and possibly standing biomass and/or (2) monitoring stress to the plants, including water stress, nutrient stress, and plant pathogens. Sensing of volatile compounds produced by the plants is not solicited for this subtopic.",1 to 3,"Level 1: TX 06 Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation Systems

Plants are grown in a solid medium (arcillite or calcined clay) that is sterilized prior to launch, and plants are typically propagated using surface sterilized seeds. But neither system is sterile in its operations and are open to the cabin environment (Veggie) or occasionally opened and accessed by the crew for horticultural operations (APH). For one Veggie study, a Fusarium fungus was noted growing on zinnia plants, likely due to a malfunction in the air circulation resulting in very high humidity. Similar environmental anomalies (environmental control failures, too little or too much water in the root zone, nutrient stress) can occur in any controlled environment, including those envisioned for future space crop production systems. Having a microbiome that can confer resistance to such perturbations and generally promote healthier growth can reduce the risk of crop failures for these systems. Biocontainment measures are not typically required for probiotic consortia in field settings, but may be an issue in confined environments of space. Introducing a tailored microbiome into a controlled environment such as Veggie aboard the ISS will undoubtedly rule out classes of microbes due to their propensity to become opportunistic pathogens. Therefore, there is a large knowledge gap when it comes to the types of strains that will be beneficial for crop production not only in space, but in closed environments. Storage and handling of these tailored microbiomes for long-duration space exploration also presents a unique challenge.","This technology could be proven on the ISS and would be useful to long-duration human exploration missions, including Gateway, lunar surface, and Mars, including surface and transit. This subtopic is directed at needs identified by the Life Support and Habitation Systems Capability Leadership Team (CLT) in areas of in situ production of fresh foods. The research is also applicable to the rapidly expanding controlled environment agriculture (CEA) industry on Earth.","

Focus Area 7 Human Research and Health Maintenance,H12.01Radioprotectors and Mitigators of Space Radiation-Induced Health Risks, JSC,, 2021,Radioprotectors and Mitigators of Space Radiation-Induced Health Risks,"Space radiation is a significant obstacle when sending humans on long-duration missions beyond low Earth orbit. Although various forms for radiation exist in space, astronauts during Lunar or Mars missions will be exposed constantly to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), which consists of high-energy particles ranging from protons to extremely heavy ions. Astronaut health risks from space radiation exposure are categorized into cancer, late and early central nervous systems (CNS) effects, and degenerative risks, which include cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and premature aging. With the current gender and age-specific exposure limits for cancer risks, few female astronauts will be able to fly long-duration missions without countermeasures.This subtopic solicits proposals to develop biological countermeasures that mitigate one or several of the radiation risks associated with space travel. Compounds that target common pathways (e.g., inflammation) across aging, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration would be preferred. Most of the countermeasure developments in the medical arena have focused on mitigating the effects of X- or gamma rays. The proposed project should focus on repurposing of technology and compounds for high-energy charged-particle applications. Compounds that are under current development or have been proven effective for other applications are both suitable for this subtopic.",5 to 8,"Level 1: TX 06 Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation Systems
Level 2: TX 06.5 Radiation",Analysis,"Deliverables for Phase I of the project will be data generated in testing the proposed radioprotectors with high energy protons. The company should test the proposed radioprotectors using high energy protons or other charged particles at space relevant doses. This testing can be performed with cell models at an accelerator facility of choice. After contract award, the company should immediately coordinate with the NASA technical monitor for any special considerations for the testing. In Phase II of the project, the company should conduct in vivo evaluation of the radioprotectors using appropriate animal models, which may include humanized mouse models. Testing in Phase II of the project should be performed with a combination of different particle types and energies that simulate the space radiation environment. NASA will make the accelerator facility at the Brookhaven National Laboratory available for both Phase I and II of the project. Demonstration of the effectiveness in reducing proton-induced biological impacts is needed for a successful Phase II proposal. Deliverables for Phase II of the project will be data generated using animal models and a combination of charged particle types and energies.","Exposure of crew members to space radiation during Lunar and Mars missions can potentially impact the success of the missions and cause long-term diseases. Space radiation risks include cancer, late and early CNS effects, CVD, and accelerated aging. Abiding by the current exposure limits for cancer risks, few female astronauts will be able to fly long-duration missions. Mitigation of space radiation risks can be achieved with physical (shielding) and biomedical means. This subtopic addresses development of drugs that mitigate one or several of the identified space radiation risks. Development of countermeasures for adverse health effects from radiation exposure is also actively supported by the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the National Institute of Health (NIH). However, some of the radioprotectors used in radiotherapy might have toxic levels that are unacceptable for astronauts. Some of the countermeasures developed for DOD/DHS are aimed at mitigating acute radiation syndromes, but not cancer risks. Furthermore, these radioprotectors are mostly for exposure to X- or gamma rays. This SBIR subtopic solicits specifically proposals to evaluate the radioprotectors that have been proven effective in mitigating biological impacts of X- or gamma rays for space radiation applications.",This subtopic seeks technology development that benefits the Space Radiation Element of the NASA Human Research Program (HRP).

Focus Area 7 Human Research and Health Maintenance,H12.03Portable Spatial Disorientation Simulator - Trainer, JSC,, 2021,Portable Spatial Disorientation Simulator - Trainer,"Astronauts are at risk of spatial disorientation due to vestibular alterations during and following g-level transitions, such as landing on Earth. This disorientation has previously been simulated using a bilateral bipolar Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) delivered in a suprathreshold range (2 to 5 mA) over the mastoid processes independent of head orientation. NASA needs a portable GVS-based system that can be coupled to head orientation and movements to enhance the simulation of the g-transition induced spatial disorientation effect astronauts experience.This system will be used for astronaut crewmembers to simulate performing landing and recovery type tasks while experiencing head-tilt contingent vertigo due to vestibular alterations. This simulator will also be used by recovery operations personnel to validate nominal and contingency procedures with a simulated deconditioned crewmember. Finally, this disorientation simulator will be used experimentally to develop sensorimotor standards related to fitness to perform critical mission tasks.The requirements include:Phase 1A head-worn inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor that can measure natural head rotation (position and velocity) and linear acceleration in all three planes. A GVS that is head-coupled and proportional to head tilt orientation as well as pitch and roll velocity, with the ability to adjust the algorithms to alter the IMU sensor combinations that drive the GVS signal. The system should also allow a user-adjustable manual gain to allow for individual sensitivity, with minimal two-fault current limit at 5 mA and emergency on/off switch. The system should allow a two-channel multiple electrode configuration that can provide illusory motion in both head roll and pitch axes. The system should be self-powered for minimally 1 hr with user switchable rechargeable batteries. The system should include nonvolatile memory (onboard data storage) to record IMU sensor data, GVS current delivery, and external trigger and/or manual synch event push-button timing. This system should be able to be worn while performing nonsuited crew landing and egress type activities without interfering with other crew-worn equipment.",2 to 6,"Level 1: TX 06 Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation Systems

Focus Area 8 In-Situ Resource Utilization,"T14.01Advanced Concepts for Lunar and Martian Propellant Production, Storage, Transfer, and Usage", GRC, JSC, 2021,"Advanced Concepts for Lunar and Martian Propellant Production, Storage, Transfer, and Usage","This subtopic seeks technologies related to cryogenic propellant (e.g., hydrogen, oxygen, and methane) production, storage, transfer, and usage to support NASA's in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) goals. This includes a wide range of applications, scales, and environments consistent with future NASA missions to the Moon and Mars. Anticipated outcome of Phase I proposals are expected to deliver proof of the proposed concept with some sort of basic testing or physical demonstration. Proposals shall include plans for a prototype and demonstration in a defined relevant environment (with relevant fluids) at the conclusion of Phase II. Solicited topics are as follows:A piecewise-smooth set of correlations for use in lumped node codes that models the complete cryogenic pool boiling curve for heat transfer between fluid and wall encountered in cryogenic storage (e.g., hot spots along the tank wall) or transfer systems. Six submodels should be developed, including (1) onset of nucleate boiling, (2) nucleate boiling heat transfer coefficient (HTC), (3) critical heat flux (CHF), (4) transition boiling HTC, (5) Leidenfrost point, and (6) film boiling HTC. There should be seamless coupling between all five submodels such that the boiling curve is a smooth function (heat flux as a function of wall superheat). Both quenching and heating configurations must be modeled. The model must be anchored to experimental cryogenic pool boiling data for helium, hydrogen, argon, nitrogen, oxygen, and methane. The complete cryogenic pool boiling model should be validated against cryogenic experimental data across the range of fluids, with a target accuracy of 25%. The quenching and heating pool boiling models and implementation scheme should be a deliverable. Phase I should have an emphasis on developing the CHF model for all cryogens while Phase II should include the remaining five models as well as microgravity applications. Develop and demonstrate methodologies for recovering propellant from lunar and Martian descent stages that have low fill levels (<5%) of liquid oxygen, hydrogen, and/or methane mixed with helium. Methodologies can assume liquid extraction (for a short amount of time) or vapor extraction. Possible uses of the fluids could include fuel cells, life support/breathing air, or other applications. Methodologies should focus on the amount of propellant that might be extractable at different purities (prop/helium). Phase I should focus on defining and refining the methodologies for scavenging, as well as defining what should be done to the landers to enable or facilitate later access for scavenging. Phase II should include some sort of a demonstration, perhaps using simulant or similar fluids. Advance nonliquid electrolyte technologies for chemical flow cells (e.g., fuel cells, electrolyzers, flow batteries, etc.) that generate electrical power from a chemical reaction or reconstitute a reaction byproduct into fuels and oxidizer for such a chemical flow cell. These electrolytes are required to be cycled through very low temperatures (<150 K) during storage to survive a lunar night or cislunar travel and recover completely (>98%) mechanical, electrical, and chemical performance. Ideally, these electrolytes would be able to process propellants (hydrogen, oxygen, methane, kerosene, etc.) and either tolerate or recover from exposure to standard propellant contaminants with minimal/no performance loss. Due to the potential for high fluid pressures and vibration loads, any proposal will illustrate how the electrolyte could be mechanically supported to operate hermetically under these conditions. To demonstrate that the electrolyte exceeds the state of theart, the deliverable test article will support an electrical current density of at least 300 mA/cm2 for at least 500 hr, support transient currents >750 mA/cm2 for at least 30 sec, and support slew rates >50 A/cm2/s. Providing test data for the electrolyte performance degradation rate when operated as intended is required with test times >5,000 hr significantly strengthening the proposal. It would be beneficial if the electrolyte operated reversibly with equal efficiently. Liquid electrolytes, loose or contained within a support structure, are excluded from this scope due to the complications that liquid electrolytes pose for an eventual system during launch.NASA has plans to purchase services for delivery of payloads to the Moon through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contract. Under this subtopic, proposals may include efforts to develop payloads for flight demonstration of relevant technologies in the lunar environment. The CLPS payload accommodations will vary depending on the particular service provider and mission characteristics. Additional information on the CLPS program and providers can be found at this link: https://www.nasa.gov/content/commercial-lunar-payload-services. CLPS missions will typically carry multiple payloads for multiple customers. Smaller, simpler, and more self-sufficient payloads are more easily accommodated and more likely to be considered for a NASA-sponsored flight opportunity. Commercial payload delivery services may begin as early as 2020 and flight opportunities are expected to continue well into the future. In future years, it is expected that larger and more complex payloads will be accommodated. Selection for award under this solicitation will not guarantee selection for a lunar flight opportunity.",2 to 4,"Level 1: TX 14 Thermal Management Systems

Prototype","Phase I proposals should at minimum deliver proof of the concept, including some sort of testing or physical demonstration, not just a paper study. Phase II proposals should provide component validation in a laboratory environment preferably with hardware (or model subroutines) deliverable to NASA.Electrolyte technologies for chemical cell product deliverables would be an operational electrochemical test article demonstrating the capability of the electrolyte to support the listed current density by processing the intended propellants when packaged as a flow cell. This test article will have an active area of at least 50 cm2 and would ideally contain multiple cells to demonstrate extensibility to existing stack designs. It would be favorable to include empirical electrochemical performance data of the electrolyte over as much of the pressure range from 5 to 3,015 psia as possible to illustrate the potential viability range for lunar applications.","Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM) is a cross-cutting technology suite that supports multiple forms of propulsion systems (nuclear and chemical), including storage, transfer, and gauging, as well as liquefaction of ISRU-produced propellants. Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) has identified that CFM technologies are vital to NASA's exploration plans for multiple architectures, whether it is hydrogen/oxygen or methane/oxygen systems including chemical propulsion and nuclear thermal propulsion. There are no complete cryogenic data-based pool boiling curves for propellants of interest.Existing electrolytes for space applications are limited to a polymeric membrane based on perfluorinated teflon and ceramic electrolyte. While it has the necessary electrochemical and mechanical properties, the polymeric membrane has very tight thermal constraints due to a high moisture content, which complicates thermal system designs for lunar systems during transit. It is also very sensitive to chemical contamination. The ceramic electrolyte has significant mechanical and slew rate limitations, but is more resilient to chemical contamination and has a much larger thermal range, which allows storage in very cold environments. Once operational and at temperature, either existing electrolyte technology operates in cold lunar regions. Should an off-nominal event occur during the lunar night that results in a cold-soak, neither existing electrolyte technology has a meaningful chance of recovering from the exposure to the low temperatures.","STMD strives to provide the technologies that are needed to enable exploration of the solar system, both manned and unmanned systems; CFM is a key technology to enable exploration. Whether liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen or liquid oxygen/liquid methane is chosen by Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) as the main in-space propulsion element to transport humans, CFM will be required to store propellant for up to 5 years in various orbital environments. Transfer will also be required, whether to engines or other tanks (e.g., depot/aggregation), to enable the use of cryogenic propellants that have been stored. In conjunction with ISRU, cryogens will have to be produced, liquefied, and stored, the latter two of which are CFM functions for the surface of the Moon or Mars. ISRU and CFM liquefaction drastically reduces the amount of mass that has to be landed on the Moon or Mars.NASA already has proton-exchange-membrane- (PEM-) based electrochemical hardware in the International Space Station (ISS) Oxygen Generator Assembly and is developing electrochemical systems for space applications through the Evolved Regenerative Fuel Cell. These system designs could be readily adapted to a solid electrolyte with capabilities beyond the existing state of the art for specific applications such as ISRU, lunar fuel cell power systems, or regenerative fuel cell energy storage systems. As CLPS companies have identified primary fuel cell power systems as a required technology, it would be helpful to ensure that there are options available that could survive the lunar night when offline without active thermal control. This would enable a longer period between missions to refuel and recover the electrochemical system.","

Terrestrial state-of-the-art solar concentrators are heavy, not designed for easy packaging/shipping and assembly/installation, and can be maintained and cleaned on a periodic basis to maintain performance. For ISRU space applications, NASA is interested in solar concentrators that are able to be packaged into small volumes, are lightweight, easily deployed and set up, can autonomously track the Sun, and can perform self-cleaning operations to remove accumulated dust. Materials, components, and systems that would be necessary for the proposed technology must be able to operate on the lunar surface in temperatures of up to 110 oC (230 oF) during sunlit periods and as as low as -170 oC (-274 oF) during periods of darkness. Systems must also be able to operate for at least 1 year with a goal of 5 years without substantial maintenance in the dusty regolith environment. Proposers should assume that regolith mining operations will be tens of meters away from the solar concentrators, but that regolith processing systems and solar concentrators will be co-located on a single lander. Phase I efforts can be demonstrated at any scale; Phase II efforts must be scalable up to 11.1 kW of delivered solar energy, assuming an incoming solar flux of ~1,350 W/m2 while also considering volumetric constraints for launch and landing. Each of the following specific areas of technology interest may be developed as a standalone technology.Lightweight mirrors/lenses: Proposals must clearly state the estimated W/kg for the proposed technology. Phase II deliverables must be deployed and supported in Earth 1g (without wind loads) but should include design recommendations for mass reductions for lunar gravity (1/6g) deployment. Proposals should address the following attributes: high reflectivity, low coefficient of thermal expansion, strength, mass, reliability, and cost. Efficient transmission of energy for oxygen/metal extraction: While the solar concentrator will need to move to track the Sun, reactors requiring direct thermal energy for oxygen extraction will be in a fixed position and orientation. Concentrated sunlight must be directed to a single or multiple spots to effectively heat or melt the regolith. Proposals must define the expected transition losses from collection to delivery and should capture any assumptions made regarding the distance from collection to delivery. Sintering end effector: Solar concentrators have been used to demonstrate the fabrication of 3D printed components using regolith as the only feedstock. Proposals responding to this specific technology area must produce and maintain a focal point temperature between 1,000 and 1,100 oC for the purpose of sintering lunar regolith.

Focus Area 8 In-Situ Resource Utilization,Z12.01Extraction of Oxygen and Water from Lunar Regolith, JSC," GRC, JPL, KSC, MSFC", 2021,Novel Oxygen Extraction Concepts,"Solar concentrators have been used to successfully demonstrate multiple in situ resource utilization (ISRU) technologies, including hydrogen and carbothermal reduction, sintering of regolith to produce launch/landing pads, and production of blocks for construction. Terrestrial state-of-the-art solar concentrators are heavy, not designed for easy packaging/shipping and assembly/installation, and can be maintained and cleaned on a periodic basis to maintain performance. For ISRU space applications, NASA is interested in solar concentrators that are able to be packaged into small volumes, are lightweight, easily deployed and set up, can autonomously track the Sun, and can perform self-cleaning operations to remove accumulated dust. Materials, components, and systems that would be necessary for the proposed technology must be able to operate on the lunar surface in temperatures of up to 110 oC (230 oF) during sunlit periods and as as low as -170 oC (-274 oF) during periods of darkness. Systems must also be able to operate for at least 1 year with a goal of 5 years without substantial maintenance in the dusty regolith environment. Proposers should assume that regolith mining operations will be tens of meters away from the solar concentrators, but that regolith processing systems and solar concentrators will be co-located on a single lander. Phase I efforts can be demonstrated at any scale; Phase II efforts must be scalable up to 11.1 kW of delivered solar energy, assuming an incoming solar flux of ~1,350 W/m2 while also considering volumetric constraints for launch and landing. Each of the following specific areas of technology interest may be developed as a standalone technology.Lightweight mirrors/lenses: Proposals must clearly state the estimated W/kg for the proposed technology. Phase II deliverables must be deployed and supported in Earth 1g (without wind loads) but should include design recommendations for mass reductions for lunar gravity (1/6g) deployment. Proposals should address the following attributes: high reflectivity, low coefficient of thermal expansion, strength, mass, reliability, and cost. Efficient transmission of energy for oxygen/metal extraction: While the solar concentrator will need to move to track the Sun, reactors requiring direct thermal energy for oxygen extraction will be in a fixed position and orientation. Concentrated sunlight must be directed to a single or multiple spots to effectively heat or melt the regolith. Proposals must define the expected transition losses from collection to delivery and should capture any assumptions made regarding the distance from collection to delivery. Sintering end effector: Solar concentrators have been used to demonstrate the fabrication of 3D printed components using regolith as the only feedstock. Proposals responding to this specific technology area must produce and maintain a focal point temperature between 1,000 and 1,100 oC for the purpose of sintering lunar regolith. Proposals should assume that the focal point can move along the regolith at a speed between 1 and 10 mm/sec.",4 to 5,"Level 1: TX 07 Exploration Destination Systems

Hardware",See Scope Description for definitions of Phase I and II deliverables for each technology.,"The carbothermal reduction process was demonstrated at a relevant scale using an automated reactor in 2010. Multiple efforts are underway to bring carbothermal reduction technology to TRL6. Other techniques that use ionic liquids, molten salts, and molten regolith electrolysis have been demonstrated at the bench scale, but current designs lack a means to move regolith in and out of the oxygen extraction zone. Many of these processes are used terrestrially, but industrial designs do not provide a means to keep gases from escaping to the vacuum of space.","The Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) has identified the need for oxygen extraction from regolith. The alternative path, oxygen from lunar water, currently has much more visibility. However, we currently do not know enough about the concentration and accessibility of lunar water to begin mining it at a useful scale. A lunar water prospecting mission is required to properly assess the utilization potential of water on the lunar surface. Until water prospecting data becomes available, NASA recognizes the need to make progress on the technology needed to extract oxygen from dry lunar regolith.","

"Focus Area 9 Sensors, Detectors, and Instruments",S1.01Lidar Remote-Sensing Technologies, LaRC, GSFC, 2021,Lidar Remote-Sensing Technologies,"NASA recognizes the potential of lidar technology to meet many of its science objectives by providing new capabilities or offering enhancements over current measurements of atmospheric, geophysical, and topographic parameters from ground, airborne, and space-based platforms. To meet NASA’s requirements for remote sensing from space, advances are needed in state-of-the-art lidar technology with an emphasis on compactness, efficiency, reliability, lifetime, and high performance. Innovative lidar subsystem and component technologies that directly address the measurement of atmospheric constituents and surface features of the Earth, Mars, the Moon, and other planetary bodies will be considered under this subtopic. Compact, high-efficiency lidar instruments for deployment on unconventional platforms, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, SmallSats, and CubeSats are also considered and encouraged.Proposals must show relevance to the development of lidar instruments that can be used for NASA science-focused measurements or to support current technology programs. Meeting science needs leads to four primary instrument types:Backscatter: Measures beam reflection from aerosols and clouds to retrieve the optical and microphysical properties of suspended particulates. Laser spectral absorption: Measures laser absorption by trace gases from atmospheric or surface backscatter and volatiles on surfaces of airless planetary bodies at multiple laser wavelengths to retrieve concentration of gas within measurement volume. Ranging: Measures the return beam’s time of flight to retrieve distance. Doppler: Measures wavelength changes in the return beam to retrieve relative velocity",3 to 6,"Level 1: TX 08 Sensors and Instruments

A typical Phase I deliverable could be a technical report demonstrating the feasibility of the technology and a design that is to be built under a Phase II program. In some instances where a small subsystem is under investigation, a prototype deliverable under the Phase I is acceptable.Phase II prototypes should be capable of laboratory demonstration and preferably suitable for operation in the field from a ground-based station, an aircraft platform, or any science platform amply defended by the proposer. Higher fidelity Phase II prototypes that are fielded in harsh environments such as aircraft often require follow on programs such as Phase III SBIR to evaluate and optimize performance in relevant environment.","Compact, efficient, and rugged narrow-linewidth continuous-wave and pulsed lasers operating between ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths suitable for lidar. Specific wavelengths are of interest to match absorption lines or atmospheric transmission: 290 to 320 nm (ozone absorption), 450 to 490 nm (ocean sensing), 532 nm, 817 nm (water vapor line), 935 nm (water vapor line), 1064 nm, 1550 nm (Doppler wind), 1645 to 1650 nm (methane line), and 3000 to 4000 nm (hydrocarbon lines and ice measurement). Architectures involving new developments in high-efficiency diode laser, quantum cascade laser, and fiber laser technologies are especially encouraged. For pulsed lasers two different regimes of repetition rate and pulse energies are desired: from 1 to 10 kHz with pulse energy greater than 1 mJ and from 20 to 100 Hz with pulse energy greater than 100 mJ. For laser spectral spectral absorption applications such as Differential Absorption Lidar or Integrated Path Absorption Lidar a frequency-agile source is required to tune >100 pm on a shot-by-shot basis while maintaining high spectral purity of >1000:1. Laser sources of wavelength at or around 780 nm are not sought this year. Also, laser sources of wavelength at or near 2050 nm are not sought this year. Laser sources for lidar measurements of carbon dioxide are not sought this year.Novel approaches and components for lidar receivers such as: integrated optical/photonic circuitry, frequency-agile ultra-narrow-band solar blocking filters at 817 and/or 935 nm, and phased-array or electro-optical beam scanners for large ( >10 cm) apertures. Development of telescopes should be submitted to a different subtopic within S2 “Advanced Telescope Technologies,” unless the design is specifically a lidar component, such as a telescope integrated with other optics. Infrared photodetectors involving new semiconductor materials/architectures should be submitted to a different subtopic, S1.04 “Sensor and Detector Technologies for Visible, IR, Far-IR, and Submillimeter,” unless the design is specifically a lidar component, such as a photodetector combined with electronics or optics for lidar application that match wavelength ranges listed for lasers in the above bullet. Receivers for direct-detection wind lidar are not sought this year. New 3D mapping and hazard detection lidar with compact and high-efficiency diode and fiber lasers to measure range and surface reflectance of planets or asteroids from >100 km altitude during mapping to <1 m during landing or sample collection, within size, weight, and power fit into a 4U CubeSat or smaller. New lidar technologies are sought that allow system reconfiguration in orbit, single photon sensitivities and single beam for long distance measurement, and variable dynamic range and multiple beams for near-range measurements. Transformative technologies and architectures are sought to vastly reduce the cost, size, and complexity of lidar instruments. Advances are needed in generation of high-efficiency and high-pulse energy (>>1 mJ) from compact (SmallSat to CubeSat size) packages, avoiding the long cavity lengths associated with current solid-state laser transmitter designs. Mass-producible laser designs, perhaps by a hybrid diode/fiber/crystal architecture, are desirable for affordable sensor solutions and reducing parts count. Heat removal from lasers is a persistent problem, requiring new technologies for thermal management of laser transmitters. New materials concepts could be of interest for the reduction of weight for optical benches and subcomponents. Novel low-SWaP (size, weight, and power) electrical systems are of interest for data acquisition from multipixel linear mode photon detector arrays in future multichannel lidar receivers, capable of fast waveform capturing, onboard signal processing, and data compression.","The proposed subtopic addresses missions, programs, and projects identified by the Science Mission Directorate, including:Atmospheric Water Vapor—Profiling of tropospheric water vapor supports studies in weather and dynamics, radiation budget, clouds, and aerosols processes. Aerosols—Profiling of atmospheric aerosols and how aerosols relate to clouds and precipitation.Atmospheric Winds—Profiling of wind fields to support studies in weather and atmospheric dynamics on Earth and atmospheric structure of planets. Topography—Altimetry to support studies of vegetation and the cryosphere of Earth, as well as the surface of planets and solar system bodies. Greenhouse Gases—Column measurements of atmospheric gases, such as methane, that affect climate variability. Hydrocarbons—Measurements of planetary atmospheres. Gases Related to Air Quality—Sensing of tropospheric ozone, nitrogen dioxide, or formaldehyde to support NASA projects in atmospheric chemistry and health effects. Automated Landing, Hazard Avoidance, and Docking—Technologies to aid spacecraft and lander maneuvering and safe operations.","

For Small/CubeSats the challenges are to get enough of an antenna aperture with the proper length to achieve relatively high bandwidths. No such 10% fractional antenna exists for the Small/CubeSat form factors.High-frequency antennas can often be hosted without deployment, but a ~1-m2-diameter antenna on a Small/CubeSat is required to be deployable.

"Focus Area 9 Sensors, Detectors, and Instruments","S1.04Sensor and Detector Technologies for Visible, Infrared (IR), Far-IR, and Submillimeter", JPL," ARC, GSFC, LaRC", 2021,"Sensor and Detector Technologies for Visible, Infrared (IR), Far-IR, and Submillimeter","NASA is seeking new technologies or improvements to existing technologies to meet the detector needs of future missions, as described in the most recent decadal surveys:Earth Science and Applications from Space: http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11820.html(link is external) New Frontiers in the Solar System: http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10432.html(link is external) Astronomy and Astrophysics in the New Millennium: http://www.nap.edu/books/0309070317/html/(link is external)Please note:1. Technologies for visible detectors are not being solicited this year.2. Proposers should direct proposals to S1.01 for technologies that don’t address fundamental photodetection process improvements, (i.e., improvement in detection efficiency, excess noise, dark count rate, gain characteristics, afterpulsing, etc.), but instead focus on lidar-only solutions for detection and readout technologies not widely applicable to other fields.Please see the S1.01 scope for further clarification on what is being solicited.LOW-POWER AND LOW-COST READOUT INTEGRATED ELECTRONICSPhotodiode Arrays: In-pixel Digital Readout Integrated Circuit (DROIC) for high-dynamic-range IR imaging and spectral imaging (10 to 60 Hz operation) focal plane arrays to circumvent the limitations in charge well capacity, by using in-pixel digital counters that can provide orders-of-magnitude larger effective well depth, thereby affording longer integration times. Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector/Transition-Edge Sensor (MKID/TES) Detectors: A radiation-tolerant, digital readout system is needed for the readout of low-temperature detectors such as MKIDs or other detector types that use microwave-frequency-domain multiplexing techniques. Each readout channel of the system should be capable of generating a set of at least 1,500 carrier tones in a bandwidth of at least 1 GHz with 14-bit precision and 1-kHz frequency placement resolution. The returning-frequency multiplexed signals from the detector array will be digitized with at least 12-bit resolution. A channelizer will then perform a down-conversion at each carrier frequency with a configurable decimation factor and maximum individual subchannel bandwidth of at least 50 Hz. The power consumption of a system consisting of multiple readout channels should be at most 20 mW per subchannel or 30 W per 1-GHz readout channel. That requirement would most likely indicate the use of a radio-frequency (RF) system on a chip (SoC) or application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) with combined digitizer and channelizer functionality. Bolometric Arrays: Low-power, low-noise, cryogenic multiplexed readout for large format two-dimensional (2D) bolometer arrays with 1,000 or more pixels, operating at 65 to 350 mK. We require a superconducting readout capable of reading two TESs per pixel within a 1 mm2 spacing. The wafer-scale readout of interest will be capable of being indium-bump bonded directly to 2D arrays of membrane bolometers. We require row and column readout with very low crosstalk, low read noise \, and low detector noise-equivalent power degradation. Thermopile Detector Arrays: Mars Climate Sounder (MCS), the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment (DLRE), and the Polar Radiant Energy in the Far Infrared Experiment (PREFIRE) are NASA space-borne radiometers that utilize custom thermopile detector arrays. Next-generation radiometers will use larger format thermopile detector arrays, indium bump bonding to hybridize the detector arrays to the Readout Integrated Circuits (ROICs), low input-referred noise, and low power consumption. ROICs compatible with 128×64 element Bi-Sb-Te thermopile arrays with low 1/f noise, an operating temperature between 200 and 300 K, radiation hardness to 300 krad, and on-ROIC analog-to-digital converter (ADC) will be desirable.LIDAR DETECTORSEnhanced photon detection efficiency (PDE), low excess noise, low dark noise, radiation-tolerant detectors for space-based 1.064-µm cloud profiling lidar applications. Detector should operate at a noncryogenic temperature. Solutions could include patterned/black silicon and III-V materials, but should optimize for signal-to-noise ratio in the ~3.7 fW to 190 nW optical power range (~2×104 to 1×1012 photons/sec) at 1.064 µm. Architectures might include massively parallel, fast-photon counting arrays of diodes operated in Geiger mode, or avalanche photodiodes (APDs) operated in linear mode with higher PDE than existing silicon APDs (PDE > 40%), but with a comparable or lower excess noise factor (ENF < 3). Improved absorption of 1.064 µm than bulk silicon is desired for better radiation tolerance and lower noise. A timing resolution of 67 ns (~10 m) is desired for atmospheric profiling, but resolutions of 1 ns (~15 cm) or better would make this detector more widely applicable to hard target ranging in areas such as planetary surface mapping, and vegetation/canopy lidar.Sensitivity of such a detector to the near-IR from 800 to 950 nm would also enable high-precision atmospheric profiling of key trace gases such as water vapor.IR & Far-IR/SUBMILLIMETER-WAVE DETECTORSNovel Materials and Devices: New or improved technologies leading to measurement of trace atmospheric species (e.g., CO, CH4, N2O) or broadband energy balance in the IR and far-IR from geostationary and low-Earth orbital platforms. Of particular interest are new direct detector or heterodyne detector technologies made using high-temperature superconducting films (YBCO, MgB2) or engineered semiconductor materials, especially 2D electron gas (2DEG) and quantum wells (QW). Array Receivers: Development of a robust wafer-level packaging/integration technology that will allow high-frequency-capable interconnects and allow two dissimilar substrates (i.e., silicon and GaAs) to be aligned and mechanically 'welded' together. Specially develop ball grid and/or through-silicon via (TSV) technology that can support submillimeter-wave (frequency above 300 GHz) arrays. Compact and efficient systems for array receiver calibration and control are also needed. Receiver Components: Local oscillators capable of spectral coverage 2 to 5 THz; Output power up to >2 mW; frequency agility with >1 GHz near chosen THz frequency; Continuous phase-locking ability over the terahertz-tunable range with <100-kHz line width. Both solid-state (low-parasitic Schottky diodes) as well as quantum cascade lasers (for f > 2 THz) will be needed. Components and devices such as mixers, isolators, and orthomode transducers, working in the terahertz range, that enable future heterodyne array receivers are also desired. GaN-based power amplifiers at frequencies above 100 GHz and with power-added efficiency (PAE) > 25% are also needed. ASIC-based SoC solutions are needed for heterodyne receiver backends. ASICs capable of binning >6 GHz intermediate frequency bandwidth into 0.1- to 0.5-MHz channels with low power dissipation <0.5 W would be needed for array receivers.",2 to 4,"Level 1: TX 08 Sensors and Instruments

Prototype","For Phase I activities the deliverables are nominally feasibility studies, detailed design, or determination of the trade space and detailed optimization of the design, as described in a final report. In some circumstances simple prototype models for the hardware can be demonstrated and tested.For Phase II studies a working prototype that can be tested at one of the NASA centers is highly desirable.","Efficient multipixel readout electronics are needed both for room-temperature operation as well as cryogenic temperatures. We can produce millions-of-pixel detector arrays at IR wavelengths up to about 14 µm, only because there are ROICs available on the market. Without these, high-density, large-format IR arrays such as quantum well infrared photodetectors, HgCdTe, and strained-layer superlattice would not exist. The Moore's Law corollary for pixel count describes the number of pixels for the digital camera industry as growing in an exponential manner over the past several decades, and the trend is continuing. The future of long-wave detectors is moving toward tens of thousands of pixels and beyond. Readout circuits capable of addressing their needs do not exist, and without them the astronomical community will not be able to keep up with the needs of the future. These technology needs must be addressed now, or we are at risk of being unable to meet the science requirements of the future.Commercially available ROICs typically have well depths of less than 10 million electrons. 6- to 9-bit, ROACH-2 board solutions with 2,000 bands, <10 kHz bandwidth in each are state of the art (SOA). IR detector systems are needed for Earth imaging based on the recently released Earth Decadal Survey. Direct detectors with D ~ 109 cm-rtHz/W achieved in this range. Technologies with new materials that take advantage of cooling to the 30 to 100 K range are capable of D ~ 1012 cm-rtHz/W. Broadband (>15%) heterodyne detectors that can provide sensitivities of 5× to 10× the quantum limit in the submillimeter-wave range while operating at 30 to 77 K are an improvement in the state of the art due to higher operating temperature. Detector array detection efficiency <20% at 532 nm (including fill factor and probability of detection) for low after pulsing, low dead time designs is SOA. Far-IR bolometric heterodyne detectors are limited to 3-dB gain bandwidth of around 3 GHz. Novel superconducting material such a MgB2 can provide significant enhancement of up to 9 GHz intermediate frequency (IF) bandwidth. Cryogenic Low Noise Amplifiers (LNAs) in the 4 to 8 GHz bandwidth with thermal stability are needed for focal plane arrays, Origins Space Telescope (OST) instruments, Origins Survey Spectrometers (OSS), MKIDs, far-IR imager and polarimeters (FIPs), Heterodyne Instrument on OST (HERO), and the Lynx Telescope. DC power dissipation should be only a few milliwatts. Another frequency range of interest for LNAs is 0.5 to 8.5 GHz. This is useful for HERO. Other NASA systems in the Space Geodesy Project (SGP) would be interested in bandwidths up to 2 to 14 GHz. 15 to 20 dB gain and <5 K noise over the 4 to 8 GHz bandwidth has been demonstrated. -Currently, all space-borne heterodyne receivers are single pixel. Novel architectures are needed for ~100 pixel arrays at 1.9 THz The current SOA readout circuit is capable of reading one TES per pixel in a 1-mm2 area. 2D arrays developed by NIST have been a boon for current NASA programs. However, NIST has declined to continue to produce 2D circuits or to develop one capable of two TES-per-pixel readout. This work is extremely important to NASA’s filled, kilopixel bolometer array program. 2D cryogenic readout circuits are analogous to semiconductor ROICs operating at much higher temperatures. We can produce millions-of-pixel detector arrays at IR wavelengths up to about 14 µm, only because there are ROICs available on the market. Without these, high-density, large-format IR arrays such as quantum well infrared photodiode, HgCdTe, and strained-layer superlattice would not exist. For lidar detectors, extended-wavelength InGaAs detector/preamplifier packages operating at 2- to 2.1-µm wavelengths with high quantum efficiency (>90%) operating up to about 1 GHz bandwidth are available, as are packages operating up to about 10 GHz with lower quantum efficiency.Detectors that have >90% quantum efficiency over the full bandwidth from near DC to >5 GHz and capable of achieving near-shot-noise limited operation are not currently available.","Future short-, mid-, and long-wave IR Earth science and planetary science missions all require detectors that are sensitive and broadband with low power requirements. Future astrophysics instruments require cryogenic detectors that are supersensitive and broadband and provide imaging capability (multipixel). Aerosol spaceborne lidar as identified by 2017 decadal survey to reduce uncertainty about climate forcing in aerosol-cloud interactions and ocean ecosystem carbon dioxide uptake. Additional applications in planetary surface mapping, vegetation, and trace-gas lidar. Earth radiation budget measurement per 2007 decadal survey Clouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) Tier-1 designation to maintain the continuous radiation budget measurement for climate modeling and better understand radiative forcings. Astrophysical missions such as OST will need IR and far-IR detector and related technologies. LANDSAT Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS), Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO), BOReal Ecosystem Atmosphere Study (BOREAS), Methane Trace Gas Sounder, or other IR Earth-observing missions. Current science missions utilizing 2D, large-format cryogenic readout circuits: (1) HAWC + (High Resolution Airborne Wideband Camera Upgrade) for SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy) future missions: PIPER (Primordial Inflation Polarization Experiment), balloon-borne. PICO (Probe of Inflation and Cosmic Origins), a probe-class cosmic microwave background mission concept. Lidar detectors are needed for 3D wind measurements from space.","

"Focus Area 9 Sensors, Detectors, and Instruments","S1.05Detector Technologies for Ultraviolet (UV), X-Ray, Gamma-Ray Instruments", JPL," GSFC, MSFC", 2021,Detectors,"This subtopic covers detector requirements for a broad range of wavelengths from UV through to gamma ray for applications in Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics, and Planetary Science. Requirements across the board are for greater numbers of readout pixels, lower power, faster readout rates, greater quantum efficiency, single photon counting, and enhanced energy resolution. The proposed efforts must be directly linked to a requirement for a NASA mission. These include Explorers, Discovery, Cosmic Origins, Physics of the Cosmos, Solar-Terrestrial Probes, Vision Missions, and Earth Science Decadal Survey missions. Proposals should reference current NASA missions and mission concepts where relevant. Specific technology areas are:Large-format, solid-state single-photon-counting radiation-tolerant detectors in charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) architecture—including 3D stacked architecture—for astrophysics, planetary, and UV heliophysics missions. Solid-state detectors with polarization sensitivity relevant to astrophysics as well as planetary and Earth science applications, for example, in spectropolarimetry as well as air quality and aerosol monitoring. UV detectors for O3, NO2, SO2, H2S, and ash detection. Refer to National Research Council's Earth Science Decadal Survey (2018). Significant improvement in wide-band-gap semiconductor materials (such as AlGaN, ZnMgO, and SiC), individual detectors, and detector arrays for astrophysics missions and planetary science composition measurements. For example, SiC avalanche photodiodes (APDs) must show: Extreme-UV (EUV) photon counting, a linear mode gain >10×106 at a breakdown reverse voltage between 80 and 100 V; detection capability of better than 6 photons/pixel/s down to 135 nm wavelength. Solar-blind (visible-blind) UV, far-UV (80 to 200 nm), and EUV sensor technology with high pixel resolution, large format, high sensitivity and high dynamic range, and low voltage and power requirements—with or without photon counting. UV detectors suitable for upcoming ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) mission concepts. Solar x-ray detectors with small independent pixels (10,000 count/s/pixel) over an energy range from <5 to 300 keV. Supporting technologies that would help enable the X-ray Surveyor mission that requires the development of x-ray microcalorimeter arrays with much larger field of view, ~105 to 106 pixels, of pitch ~25 to 100 µm, and ways to read out the signals. For example, modular superconducting magnetic shielding is sought that can be extended to enclose a full-scale focal plane array. All joints between segments of the shielding enclosure must also be superconducting. Improved long-wavelength blocking filters are needed for large-area, x-ray microcalorimeters. Filters with supporting grids are sought that, in addition to increasing filter strength, also enhance electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding (1 to 10 GHz) and thermal uniformity for decontamination heating. X-ray transmission of greater than 80% at 600 eV per filter is sought, with infrared transmissions less than 0.01% and ultraviolet transmission of less than 5% per filter. A means of producing filter diameters as large as 10 cm should be considered.

Advanced sensors for the detection of elementary particles (atoms, molecules, and their ions) and electric and magnetic fields in space along with associated instrument technologies are often critical for enabling transformational science from the study of the Sun's outer corona, to the solar wind, to the trapped radiation in Earth's and other planetary magnetic fields, and to the atmospheric composition of the planets and their moons. These technologies must be capable of withstanding operation in space environments, including the expected pressures, radiation levels, launch and impact stresses, and range of survival and operational temperatures. Technology developments that result in a reduction of mass, power, volume, and data rates for instruments and instrument components without loss of scientific capability are of particular importance. In addition, technologies that can increase instrument resolution and sensitivity or achieve new and innovative scientific measurements are solicited.Improvements in particles and fields sensors and associated instrument technologies enable further scientific advancement for upcoming NASA missions such as CubeSats, Explorers, Solar Terrestrial Probe (STP), Living With a Star (LWS), and planetary exploration missions. Specifically, this year the subtopic solicits instrument development that provides significant advances in the following areas:Faraday cup: 2-kHz alternating-current (AC) power supply with direct-current (DC) offset up to 40 kV and AC peak-to-peak at 10% of DC offset, operating temperature range -35 to +55 ºC, and radiation hardness >1 ~ 200 krad. Magnetically clean >2 m compact deployable booms for CubeSats. Innovative high-efficiency neutral particle ionizers based on thermionic, cold electron emission, or ultraviolet (UV) ionization. Direct neutral particle detectors to energies <1 eV.Smaller, simpler, and more self-sufficient payloads are more easily accommodated and would be more likely to be considered for a NASA-sponsored flight opportunity.",3 to 5,"Level 1: TX 08 Sensors and Instruments

Hardware","Phase I deliverables: Concept study report, preliminary design, and test results.Phase II deliverables: Detailed design, prototype test results, and a prototype deliverable with guidelines for in-house integration and test (I&T).","High-Voltage Power Supplies DC and AC:Low-energy particle instruments often require significant high-voltage DC power supplies up to 40 kV. Some applications such as Faraday cups require sine wave power supplies with a DC offset 0 to 40 kV and AC peak-to-peak at 10% of DC offset at oscillating frequency of 2 kHz, an operating temperature range from -35 to +55 °C, and radiation hardness >1 ~ 200 krad.Importance: – Critical need for next-generation Faraday cups in order to extend the upper limit of solar wind speed measurement to >2,500 km/sec. Current Faraday cup high-voltage (HV) power supplies support maximum solar wind speeds of up to 1,500 km/sec. Very important for future space weather missions.Existing direct neutral particle detectors are not capable of detecting, without ionization, neutral particles with energy <1 eV.There is a need for nonthermionic ionizers to reduce power dissipation.There is a need for magnetically clean, small booms for CubeSat magnetometers.","Particles and fields instruments and technologies are essential bases to achieve SMD's Heliophysics goals summarized in the National Research Council’s, Solar and Space Physics: A Science for a Technological Society. In situ instruments and technologies play indispensable roles for NASA’s LWS and STP mission programs, as well as a host of smaller spacecraft in the Explorers Program. In addition, there is growing demand for particles and fields technologies amenable to CubeSats and SmallSats. NASA SMD has two excellent programs to bring this subtopic technologies to higher level: Heliophysics Instrument Development for Science (H-TIDeS) and Heliophysics Flight Opportunities for Research and Technology (H-FORT). H-TIDeS seeks to advance the development of technologies and their application to enable investigation of key heliophysics science questions. This is done through incubating innovative concepts and development of prototype technologies. It is intended that Page 2 of 3 technologies developed through H-TIDeS would then be proposed to H-FORT to mature by demonstration in a relevant environment. The H-TIDES and H-FORT programs are in addition to Phase III opportunities. Further opportunities through SMD include Explorer Missions, New Frontiers Missions, and the upcoming Geospace Dynamic Constellation.","

These instruments and sensors support NASA’s Earth Science Division (ESD) science, calibration/validation, and environmental monitoring activities by providing ancillary data for satellite calibration and validation, algorithm development/refinement, and finer scale process studies. NASA seeks measurement capabilities that support current satellite and model validation, advancement of surface-based remote-sensing networks, and targeted Airborne Science Program and ship-based field campaign activities as discussed in the Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Science (ROSES) solicitation. Data from such sensors also inform process studies to improve our scientific understanding of the Earth System.

Portable hyperspectral UV-VIS-NIR (340 to 900 nm; preferably 320 to 1,100 nm) radiometric calibration system with a stabilized optical light source for verification of field radiometer stability by traceable National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards with variable flux levels. System must include thermal stabilization for the instrument to be independent of the ambient temperature for evaluation of radiometric stability as a function of time.

"Focus Area 9 Sensors, Detectors, and Instruments",S1.10Atomic Quantum Sensor and Clocks, JPL, GSFC, 2021,Atomic Quantum Sensor and Clocks,"Space exploration relies on sensors for science measurements as well as spacecraft operation. As sensing precisions push their limits, quantum phenomena inevitably must be exploited. It is expected that sensors utilizing quantum properties will offer new and significantly improved capabilities. NASA is interested in advancing quantum sensing technologies and infusing them into space science missions. In particular, this call seeks the development and maturation towards space application and qualification of atomic systems that leverage their quantum properties (e.g., optical atomic clocks, atom interferometers, Rydberg atom sensors, and artificial-atom-based sensors such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center point-defect sensors, etc.).Recent developments of laser control and manipulation of atoms have led to new types of quantum sensors and clocks. Atomic particles, being intrinsically quantum mechanical, have demonstrated their unique advantages in metrology and sensing. Perhaps the most celebrated atomic metrology tool is the atomic clock. Atomic clocks in the optical frequency domain (i.e., optical primary frequency standards) have approached, and are expected to exceed, a frequency uncertainty beyond 1 part in 1018. These optical clocks can be used, in turn, as precision sensors; for example, sensitivity to the fundamental physics constants have been explored for detection of dark matter and time variations in those fundamental constants. These approaches, when made Doppler sensitive, become exquisite inertial sensors, mostly in the form of atom interferometers. Because the center-of-mass motion is involved, atom interferometers use atomic particles as test masses and quantum matter-wave interferometry for motional measurements. Indeed, clocks and sensors are two sides of the same coin, sharing many common physical processes, technology approaches, and salient performance features. Therefore, this subtopic combines the two subject areas for leveraged and coordinated technology advancement.The gaps to be filled and technologies to be matured include, but are not limited to, the following:(1) Optical atomic clocksSubsystem and components for high-performance and high-accuracy optical clocks, mostly notably Sr and Yb lattice clocks as well as Sr+ and Yb+ singly trapped ion clocks. They comprise atomic physics packages, which are necessarily laser systems, and include clock lasers, optical frequency combs, as well as advanced electronics and controllers based on microprocessors or field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). They should have a path to a flight system. Space-qualifiable small-size low-power clock lasers at, or subsystems that can lead to, better than 3×10-15 Hz/√τ near 0.1 to 10 s (wavelengths for Yb+, Yb, and Sr clock transitions are of special interest). Technical approaches and methods for beyond state-of-the-art compact and miniature clocks for space with emphasis on the performance per size, power, and mass.(2) Atom interferometersSpace-qualifiable high-flux ultra-cold atom sources, related components, and methods: e.g., >1×106 total atoms near the point at <1 nK: Rb, K, Cs, Yb, and Sr. Ultra-high vacuum technologies and approaches for atom interferometer applications that allow small-size and low-power, completely sealed, nonmagnetic enclosures with high-quality optical access and are capable of maintaining <1×10-9 torr residual gas pressure. Consideration should be given to the inclusion of cold atom sources of interest, such as switchable and/or regulated atom vapor pressure or flux. Beyond the state-of-the-art photonic components at wavelengths for atomic species of interest, particularly visible and ultraviolet (UV): Efficient acousto-optic modulators: e.g., low radio-frequency (RF) power ~200 mW, low thermal distortion, ~80% or greater diffraction efficiency. Efficient electro-optic modulators: e.g., low bias drift, residual AM, and return loss; fiber-coupled preferred. Miniature optical isolators: e.g., ~30 dB isolation or greater, ~ -2 dB loss or less. Robust high-speed high-extinction shutters: e.g., switching time <1 ms and extinction >60 dB are highly desired. Flight qualifiable: i.e., rugged and long-life lasers or laser systems of narrow linewidth, high tunability, and/or higher power for clock and cooling transitions of atomic species of interest; Also, cooling and trapping lasers of 10 kHz linewidth and ~1 W or greater total optical power are generally needed, but offerors may define and justify their own performance specifications. Analysis and simulation tool of a cold atom system in trapped and freefall states relevant to atom interferometer and clock measurements in space.(3) Other atomic and artificial atomic sensorsRydberg sensors or their subsystems/components for electric field or microwave measurements. Space qualifiable NV diamond or chip-scale atomic magnetometers. High-performance, miniaturized or chip-scale optical frequency combs. Other innovative atomic quantum sensors for high-fidelity field measurements that have space applications and can be developed into a space-quantifiable instrument. Because of the breath and diversity of the portfolio, performers are expected to be aware of specific gaps for specific application scenarios. All proposed system performances may be defined by offeror with clear justifications. Subsystem technology development proposals should clearly state the relevance to the anticipated system-level implementation and performance; define requirements, relevant atomic species, and working laser wavelengths; and indicate its path to a space-borne instrument. Finally, for proposals interested in quantum sensing methodologies for achieving the optimal collection of light for photon-starved astronomical observations, it is suggested to consider the STTR subtopic T8.06.",3 to 5,"Level 1: TX 08 Sensors and Instruments

These gaps are mainly in the areas of reducing size, mass, and power, while increasing their performance and advancing them towards space qualification. These gaps may pertain to components, subsystems, instruments/devices, novel approaches and/or theoretical analysis tools. Most of the needed improvements are elements which are beyond current state-of-the art. These needed improvements include high-flux ultra-cold atom sources, atomic physics packages and atomic vacuum cell technology specific for clock and atom interferometer applications, miniature optical isolators, efficient modulators, active wave front and polarization devices, fast high-extension-ratio switches, efficient detectors, and novel frequency conversion methods/devices. Also needed are lasers and laser-optics system approaches with a high degree of integration and robustness, and suitable for atomic devices; small ultra-stabilized laser systems, and miniature self-referenced optical frequency combs. These are examples and not an exhaustive list.","Currently, no technology exists that can compete with the (potential) sensitivity, (potential) compactness, and robustness of atom optical-based gravity and time measurement devices. Earth science, planetary science, and astrophysics all benefit from unprecedented improvements in gravity and time measurement.

These instruments and technologies play indispensable roles for NASA’s LWS and STP mission programs, as well as a host of smaller spacecraft in the Explorers Program. In addition, there is growing demand for remote-sensing technologies amenable to CubeSats and SmallSats. NASA SMD has two excellent programs to bring this subtopic technologies to a higher level: Heliophysics Technology and Instrument Development for Science (H-TIDeS) and Heliophysics Flight Opportunities for Research and Technology (HFORT). H-TIDeS seeks to advance the development of technologies and their application to enable investigation of key heliophysics science questions. This is done through incubating innovative concepts and development of prototype technologies. It is intended that technologies developed through H-TIDeS would then be proposed to HFORT to mature by demonstration in a relevant environment.

Shepherded by advancements in our ability to detect and manipulate single quantum objects, the so-called Second Quantum Revolution is upon us. The emerging quantum sensing technologies promise unrivaled sensitivities and are potentially game changing in precision measurement fields. Significant gains include technology important for a range of NASA missions such as efficient photon detection, optical clocks, gravitational wave sensing, ranging, and interferometry. Proposals focused on atomic quantum sensor and clocks and quantum communication should apply to those specific subtopics and are not covered in this Quantum Sensing and Measurement subtopic.Specifically identified applications of interest include quantum sensing methodologies achieving the optimal collection light for photon-starved astronomical observations, quantum-enhanced ground penetrating radar, and quantum-enhanced telescope interferometry.Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) systems for enhanced multiplexing factor reading out of arrays of cryogenic energy-resolving single-photon detectors, including the supporting resonator circuits, amplifiers, and room temperature readout electronics. Quantum light sources capable of efficiently and reliably producing prescribed quantum states including entangled photons, squeezed states, photon number states, and broadband correlated light pulses. Such entangled sources are sought for the visible infrared (vis-IR) and in the microwave entangled photons sources for quantum ranging and ground-penetrating radar. On-demand single-photon sources with narrow spectral linewidth are needed for system calibration of single-photon counting detectors and energy-resolving single-photon detector arrays in the midwave infrared (MIR), near infrared (NIR), and visible.

This can include extensive modeling, but a stronger proposal will have measured validation of models or designs that support the viability of the planned Phase II deliverable.Phase II should include prototype delivery to the government.

Such sources would utilize high detection efficiency photon energy-resolving single-photon detectors (where the energy resolution is used to detect the photon number) developed at NASA for detection. Sources that fall in the wavelength range from 20 μm to 200 nm are of high interest. Photon number state generation anywhere within this spectral range is also highly desired including emerging photon-number quantum state methods providing advantages over existing techniques. (Stobińska et al., Quantum interference enables constant-time quantum information processing. Sci. Adv. 5 (2019)).Quantum dot source produced entangled photons with a fidelity of 0.90, a pair generation rate of 0.59, a pair extraction efficiency of 0.62, and a photon indistinguishability of 0.90, simultaneously. (881 nm light) at 10 MHz. (Wang Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 113602 (2019)). Further advances are sought.Spectral brightness of 0.41 MHz/mW/nm for multimode and 0.025 MHz/mW/nm for single-mode coupling. (Jabir: Scientific Reports volume 7, Article number: 12613 (2017)).Higher brightness and multiple entanglement and heralded multiphoton entanglement and boson sampling sources. Sources that produce photon number states or Fock states are also sought for various applications including energy-resolving single-photon detector applications.For energy-resolving single-photon detectors, current state-of-the-art multiplexing can achieve kilopixel detector arrays, which with advances in microwave SQUID mux can be increased to megapixel arrays. (Morgan Physics Today 71, 8, 28 (2018)).Energy-resolving detectors achieving 99% detection efficiency have been demonstrated in the NIR. Even higher quantum efficiency absorber structures are sought (either over narrow bands or broadband) compatible with transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors. Such ultra-high- (near-unity-) efficiency absorbing structures are sought in the UV, vis-IR, NIR, mid-infrared, far-infrared, and microwave.Absolute detection efficiency measurements (without reference to calibration standards) using quantum light sources have achieved detection efficiency relative uncertainties of 0.1% level. Further reduction in detection efficiency uncertainty is sought to characterize ultra-high-efficiency absorber structures. Combining calibration method with the ability to tune over a range of different wavelengths is sought to characterize cryogenic single-photon detector's energy resolution and detection efficiency across the detection band of interest. For such applications, the natural linewidth of the source lines must be much less than the detector resolution (for NIR and higher photon energies, resolving powers R=E/ΔEFWHM=λ/ΔλFWHM << 100 are required). Quantum sources operating at cryogenic temperatures are most suitable for cryogenic detector characterization and photon number resolving detection for wavelengths of order 1.6 μm and longer.For quantum sensing applications that would involve a squeezed light source on an aerospace platform, investigation of low SWaP (size, weight, and power) sources of squeezed light would be beneficial. From the literature, larger footprint sources of squeezed light have demonstrated 15 dB of squeezing [1]. For a source smaller in footprint, there has been a recent demonstration of parametric downconversion in an OPO (optical parametric oscillator) resulting in 9.3 dB of squeezing [2]. Further improvement of the state-of-the-art light squeezing capability (i.e., >10 dB), while maintaining low-SWaP parameters, is desired.[1] . H. Vahlbruch, M. Mehmet, K. Danzmann, and R.

Focus Area 10 Advanced Telescope Technologies,S2.01Proximity Glare Suppression for Astronomical Direct Detection of Exoplanets, JPL, GSFC, 2021,Control of scattered starlight with coronagraphs and starshades,"The goal of this subtopic is to address the unique problem of imaging and spectroscopic characterization of faint astrophysical objects that are located within the obscuring glare of much brighter stellar sources. Examples include planetary systems beyond our own, the detailed inner structure of galaxies with very bright nuclei, binary star formation, and stellar evolution. Contrast ratios of one million to ten billion over an angular spatial scale of 0.05 to 1.5 arcsec are typical of these objects. Achieving a very low background requires control of both scattered and diffracted light. The failure to control either amplitude or phase fluctuations in the optical train severely reduces the effectiveness of starlight cancellation schemes.This innovative research focuses on advances in coronagraphic instruments, starlight cancellation instruments, and potential occulting technologies that operate at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. The ultimate application of these instruments is to operate in space as part of a future observatory mission concepts such as the Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) and Large Ultraviolet Optical Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR). Measurement techniques include imaging, photometry, spectroscopy, and polarimetry. There is interest in component development and innovative instrument design, as well as in the fabrication of subsystem devices to include, but not limited to, the following areas:Starlight Suppression Technologies:Hybrid metal/dielectric and polarization apodization masks for diffraction control of phase and amplitude for coronagraph-scaled starshade experiments. Low-scatter, low-reflectivity, sharp, flexible edges for control of solar scatter in starshades. Low-reflectivity coatings for flexible starshade optical shields. Methods to distinguish the coherent and incoherent scatter in a broadband speckle field.Wavefront Measurement and Control Technologies:Small-stroke, high-precision, deformable mirrors and associated driving electronics scalable to 10,000 or more actuators (both to further the state of the art towards flightlike hardware and to explore novel concepts). Multiple deformable mirror technologies in various phases of development and processes are encouraged to ultimately improve the state of the art in deformable mirror technology. Process improvements are needed to improve repeatability, yield, and performance precision of current devices. Multiplexers with ultralow power dissipation for electrical connection to deformable mirrors. Low-order wavefront sensors for measuring wavefront instabilities to enable real-time control and postprocessing of aberrations. Thermally and mechanically insensitive optical benches and systems.Optical Coating and Measurement Technologies:Instruments capable of measuring polarization crosstalk and birefringence to parts per million. Polarization-insensitive coatings for large optics. Methods to measure the spectral reflectivity and polarization uniformity across large optics.In addition this subtopic solicits proposals to develop components that improve the footprint, robustness, power consumption, reliability, and wavefront quality of high-contrast, low-temporal bandwidth, adaptive optics systems. These include application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) drivers that easily integrate with the deformable mirrors, improved connectivity technologies, as well as high-actuator-count deformable mirrors with high-quality, ultrastable wavefronts.It also seeks coronagraph masks that can be tested in ground-based high-contrast testbeds in place at a number of institutions, as well as devices to measure the masks to inform optical models. The masks include transmissive scalar, polarization-dependent, and spatial apodizing masks, including those with extremely low reflectivity regions that allow them to be used in reflection.The subtopic seeks samples of optical coatings that reduce polarization and can be applied to large optics as well as methods and instruments to characterize them over large optical surfaces.Finally, for starshades, the subtopic seeks low-reflectivity and potentially diffraction-controlling edges that minimize scattered sunlight while also remaining robust to handling and cleaning. Low-reflectivity optical coatings that can be applied to the surfaces for the large (hundreds of square meters) optical shield are also desired.",3 to 5,"Level 1: TX 08 Sensors and Instruments

Software",Under this Subtopic a concept study provided as a final report in Phase I is acceptable and a prototype for Phase II is acceptable.,"Coronagraphs have been demonstrated to achieve high contrast in moderate bandwidth in laboratory environments. Starshades will enable even deeper contrast over broader bands but to date have demonstrated deep contrast in narrow band light. The extent to which the telescope optics will limit coronagraph performance is a function of the quality of the optical coating and the ability to control polarization over the full wavefront. Neither of these technologies is well characterized at levels required for 1010 contrast. Wavefront control using deformable mirrors is critical. Controllability and stability to picometer levels is required. To date, deformable mirrors have been up to the task of providing contrast approaching 1010, but they require thousands of wires, and overall wavefront quality and stroke remain concerns.","These technologies are directly applicable to the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (NGRST) coronagraph instrument (CGI), and the HabEx and LUVOIR concept studies.","

Focus Area 10 Advanced Telescope Technologies,S2.03Advanced Optical Systems and Fabrication/Testing/Control Technologies for Extended-Ultraviolet/Optical and Infrared Telescope, MSFC," GRC, GSFC, JPL, LaRC", 2021,Balloon Planetary Telescope,"Accomplishing NASA’s high-priority science at all levels (flagship, probe, Medium-Class Explorers (MIDEX), Small Explorers (SMEX), rocket, and balloon) requires low-cost, ultrastable, normal-incidence mirror systems with low mass-to-collecting area ratios. Here, a mirror system is defined as the mirror substrate, supporting structure, and associated actuation and thermal management systems. After performance, the most important metric for an advanced optical system is affordability or areal cost (cost per square meter of collecting aperture). Current normal-incidence space mirrors cost $4 million to $6 million per square meter of optical surface area. This research effort seeks to improve the performance of advanced precision optical components while reducing their cost by 5× to 50×, to between $100K/m2 and $1M/m2.Specific metrics are defined for each wavelength application region: 1. Aperture diameter for all wavelengths, except far-infrared (IR):Monolithic: 1 to 8 m Segmented: 3 to 20 m2. For ultraviolet (UV)/optical:Areal cost: <$500K/m2 Wavefront figure: <5 nm rms (via passive design or active deformation control) Wavefront stability: <10 pm/10 min First mode frequency: 60 to 500 Hz Actuator resolution: <1 nm rms Optical pathlength stability: <1 pm/10,000 sec for precision metrology Areal density: <15 kg/m2 (<35 kg/m2 with backplane) Operating temperature range: 250 to 300 K3. For far-IR:Aperture diameter: 1 to 4 m (monolithic) or 5 to 10 m (segmented) Telescope: diffraction-limited at <30 µm at operating temperature 4 K Cryodeformation: <100 nm rms Areal cost: <$500K/m2 Production rate: >2 m2 per month Areal density: <15 kg/m2 (<40 kg/m2 with backplane) Thermal conductivity: at 4 K, >2 W/m·K Survivability at temperatures ranging from 315 to 4 K4. For extreme ultraviolet (EUV):Surface slope: <0.1 µradAlso needed is the ability to fully characterize surface errors and predict optical performance.Proposals must show an understanding of one or more relevant science needs and present a feasible plan to develop the proposed technology for infusion into a NASA program: suborbital rocket or balloon; competed SMEX or MIDEX; or Decadal-class mission. Successful proposals will demonstrate an ability to manufacture, test, and control ultra-low-cost optical systems that can meet science performance requirements and mission requirements (including processing and infrastructure issues). Material behavior, process control, active and/or passive optical performance, and mounting/deploying issues should be resolved and demonstrated.",2 to 4,"Level 1: TX 08 Sensors and Instruments

Hardware
Analysis","Phase I will produce a preliminary design and report including initial design requirements such as wavefront error budget, mass allocation budget, structural stiffness requirements, etc. as well as trade studies performed and and analysis that compares the design to the expected performance over the specified operating range. Development challenges shall be identified during Phase I, including trade studies and challenges to be addressed during Phase II with subsystem proof-of-concept demonstration hardware. If Phase II can only produce a subscale component, then it should also produce a detailed final design, including final requirements (wavefront error budget, mass allocation, etc.) and a performance assessment over the specified operating range.","Current SOA (state-of-the-art) mirrors made from Zerodur(C) or ULE(C), for example, require lightweighting to meet balloon mass limitations and cannot meet diffraction limited performance over the wide temperature range due to the coefficient of thermal expansion limitations.","“Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022”Page 22, last paragraph of NASA Telescope Facilities within the Summary Section:Balloon- and rocket-borne telescopes offer a cost-effective means of studying planetary bodies at wavelengths inaccessible from the ground. Because of their modest costs and development times, they also provide training opportunities for would-be developers of future spacecraft instruments. Although NASA’s Science Mission Directorate regularly flies balloon missions into the stratosphere, there are few funding opportunities to take advantage of this resource for planetary science because typical planetary grants are too small to support these missions. A funding line to promote further use of these suborbital observing platforms for planetary observations would complement and reduce the load on the already oversubscribed planetary astronomy program. Page 203, 5th paragraph of section titled Earth and Space-Based Telescopes:Significant planetary work can be done from balloon-based missions flying higher than 45,000 ft. This altitude provides access to electromagnetic radiation that would otherwise be absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere and permits high-spatial-resolution imaging unaffected by atmospheric turbulence. These facilities offer a combination of cost, flexibility, risk tolerance, and support for innovative solutions that is ideal for the pursuit of certain scientific opportunities, the development of new instrumentation, and infrastructure support. Given the rarity of giant-planet missions, these types of observing platforms (high-altitude telescopes on balloons and sounding rockets) can be used to fill an important data gap.Potential advocates include planetary scientists at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), and Southwest Research Institute, etc.","

Critical gaps include (1) a 50 -to 70-cm-diameter primary mirror beam expander that features near-diffraction-limited performance; low mass design; minimal aberrations with an emphasis on spherical; characterization of the polarization changes versus beam cross section, assuming input circular polarization; a lockable electronic focus adjustment; both built-in and removable fiducial aids for aligning the input laser beam to the optical axis; and a path to space qualification and (2) a 15-cm-diameter primary mirror beam expander with the same features for airborne coherent lidar systems.","Science Mission Directorate (SMD) desires both an airborne coherent-detection wind-profiling lidar systems and space-based wind measurement. The space mission has been recommended to SMD by both the 2007 and 2017 Earth Science Decadal Surveys. SMD has incorporated the wind lidar mission in its planning and has named it ""3-D Winds"". SMD recently held the Earth Venture Suborbital competition for 5 years of airborne science campaigns. The existing coherent wind lidar at Langley, Doppler Aerosol Wind (DAWN), was included in three proposals that are under review. Furthermore, SMD is baselining DAWN for a second Convective Processes Experiment (CPEX-) type airborne science campaign and for providing calibration/validation assistance to the European Space Agency (ESA) Aeolus space mission. DAWN flies on the DC-8, and it is highly desired to fit DAWN on other NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) aircraft. DAWN needs to lower its mass for several of the aircraft, and a low-mass telescope retaining the required performance is needed. Additionally, an electronic remote control of telescope focus is needed to adapt to aircraft cruise altitude and weather conditions during science flights.","

A future NASA far-IR astrophysics mission will answer compelling questions, such as:How common are life-bearing planets? How do the conditions for habitability develop during the process of planet formation? How did the universe evolve in response to its changing ingredients (buildup of heavy elements and dust over time)?To answer these questions, NASA will need telescopes and interferometers that reach fundamental sensitivity limits imposed by astrophysical background photon noise. Only telescopes cooled to a cryogenic temperature can provide such sensitivity.Novel approaches to fabrication and test developed for a far-IR astrophysics mission may be applicable to far-IR optical systems employed in other divisions of the NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD), or to optical systems designed to operate at wavelengths shorter than the far-IR.","

Off-axis designs provide superior optical performance due to the clear aperture, however, are rarely considered due to complex design, manufacturing, and metrology procedures needed. Currently flying Lightning Imaging Sensor is a large refractive lens optimized for single-wavelength operation.A reflective system is required for dual-wavelength operation.Also, a compact design is required to fit inside a CubeSAT.","Optical communications enable high-data-rate downlink of science data. The initial motivation for this scalable off-axis optical design approach is for bringing high-performance reflective optics within reach of laser communication projects with limited resources. However, this exact optical hardware is applicable for any diffraction-limited, athermalized, science imaging application. Any science mission could potentially be able to select from a “catalog” of optical aperture systems that would already have (flight) heritage and reduced risks.","

The Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) is a concept for a mission to directly image planetary systems around Sun-like stars. HabEx will be sensitive to all types of planets; however, its main goal is, for the first time, to directly image Earth-like exoplanets, and characterize their atmospheric content. By measuring the spectra of these planets, HabEx will search for signatures of habitability such as water, and be sensitive to gases in the atmosphere possibility indicative of biological activity, such as oxygen or ozone.

Focus Area 10 Advanced Telescope Technologies,S2.05Technology for the Precision Radial Velocity Measurement Technique, JPL, GSFC, 2021,"Components, Assemblies, and Subsystems for Extreme Precision Radial Velocity Measurements and Detection of Extrasolar Planets","Astronomical spectrographs have proven to be powerful tools for exoplanet searches. When a star experiences periodic motion due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet, its spectrum is Doppler modulated in time. This is the basis for the precision radial velocity (PRV) method, one of the first and most efficient techniques for detecting and characterizing exoplanets. Because spectrographs have their own drifts, which must be separated from the periodic Doppler shift, a stable reference is always needed for calibration. Optical frequency combs (OFCs) and line-referenced etalons are capable of providing the spectral rulers needed for PRV detection of exoplanets. Although “stellar jitter” (a star’s photospheric velocity contribution to the RV signal) is unavoidable, the contribution to the error budget from Earth’s atmosphere would be eliminated in future space missions. Thus, there is a need to develop robust spectral references, especially at visible wavelengths to detect and characterize Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of their Sun-like host stars, with size, weight, and power (SWaP) suitable for space-qualified operation to calibrate the next generation of high-resolution spectrographs with precision corresponding to <~1 cm/s over multiple years of observations.This subtopic solicits proposals to develop cost-effective component and subsystem technology for low-SWaP, long-lived, robust implementation of RV measurement instruments both on the ground and in space. Research areas of interest include but are not limited to:Integrated photonic spectrographs. Spectrograph gratings. PRV spectrograph calibration sources. High efficiency photonic lanterns. Advanced optical fiber delivery systems and subsystems with high levels of image scrambling and modal noise reduction. Software for advanced statistical techniques to mitigate effects of telluric absorption and stellar jitter on RV precision and accuracy.",3 to 5,"Level 1: TX 08 Sensors and Instruments
Level 2: TX 08.2 Observatories","Hardware
Software","Phase I will emphasize research aspects for technical feasibility, infusion potential into ground or space operations, clear and achievable benefits (e.g., reduction in SWaP and/or cost, improved RV precision), and show a path towards a Phase II proposal. Phase I deliverables include feasibility and concept-of-operations of the research topic, simulations and measurements, validation of the proposed approach to develop a given product (TRL 3 to 4), and a plan for further development of the specific capabilities or products to be performed in Phase II. Early development and delivery of prototype hardware/software is encouraged. Phase II will emphasize hardware/software development with delivery of specific hardware or software products for NASA targeting demonstration operations at a ground-based telescope in coordination with the lead NASA center. Phase II deliverables include a working prototype or engineering model of the proposed product/platform or software along with documentation of development, capabilities, and measurements (showing specific improvement metrics); and tools as necessary. Proposed prototypes shall demonstrate a path towards a flight-capable platform. Opportunities and plans should also be identified and summarized for potential commercialization or NASA infusion.","High-resolving-power spectrographs (R ~ 150,000) with simultaneous UV, visible, and NIR coverage and exquisite long-term stability are required for PRV studies. Classical bulk optic spectrographs traditionally used for PRV science impose architectural constraints due to their large mass and limited optical flexibility. Integrated photonic spectrographs are wafer-thin devices that could reduce instrument volume by up to 3 orders of magnitude. Spectrometers that are fiber fed, with high illumination stability, excellent wavelength calibration, and precise temperature and pressure control represent the immediate future of precision RV measurements.Traditional RV spectrographs would benefit from improvements in grating technology. Diffraction-limited PRV spectrographs require echelle gratings with low wavefront error and high efficiency, both of which are very challenging to achieve. Echelle spectrographs are designed to operate at high angle-of-incidence and very high diffraction order. Hence, the grating must have very accurate groove placement (for low wavefront error) and very flat groove facets (for high efficiency). For decades, echelle gratings have been fabricated by diamond ruling, but it is difficult to achieve all aspects of the performance required for PRV instruments. Newer grating fabrication techniques using lithographic methods to form the grooves may be a promising approach. As spectrograph stability imposes limits on how precisely RV can be measured, spectral references play a critical role in characterizing and ensuring this precision. Only laser frequency combs (LFCs) and line-referenced Fabry-Pérot etalons are capable of providing the broad spectral coverage and long-term stability needed for extreme PRV detection of exoplanets. Although both frequency combs and etalons can deliver high-precision spectrograph calibration, the former requires relatively complex hardware in the visible portion of the spectrum.Commercial fiber laser astrocombs covering 450 to 1400 nm at 25 GHz line spacing and <3-dB intensity variations over the entire bandwidth are available for ground-based astronomical spectrographs. However, the cost for these systems is often so prohibitive that recent RV spectrograph projects either do not use a LFC or include it only as a future upgrade. Alternatively, astrocombs produced by electro-optic modulation (EOM) of a laser source have been demonstrated in the NIR. EOM combs produce modes spaced at a radiofrequency (RF) modulation frequency, typically 10 to 30 GHz. Significantly, EOM combs avoid the line filtering step required by commercial mode-locked fiber laser combs. Comb frequency stabilization can be accomplished by referencing the laser pump source to a molecular absorption feature or another frequency comb. Where octave spanning EOM combs are available, f-2f self-referencing provides the greatest stability. EOM combs must be spectrally broadened to provide the bandwidth necessary for PRV applications. This is accomplished through pulse amplification followed by injection into highly nonlinear fiber or nonlinear optical waveguides.Power consumption of the frequency comb calibration system will be a significant driver of mission cost for space-based PRV systems and motivates the development of a comb system that operates with less than 20 W of spacecraft power. Thus, for flight applications, it is highly desirable to develop frequency comb technology with low power consumption; ~10 to 30 GHz mode spacing; compact size; broad (octave spanning) spectral grasp across both the visible and NIR; low phase noise; stability traceable to the International System of Units definition of the second; and importantly, long life.The intrinsic illumination stability of the spectrometer also sets a fundamental measurement floor. As the image of the star varies at the entrance to the spectrometer because of atmospheric effects and telescope guiding errors, so too does the recorded stellar spectrum, leading to a spurious RV offset. Current seeing-limited PRV instruments use multimode optical fibers, which provide some degree of azimuthal image scrambling, to efficiently deliver stellar light from the telescope focal plane to the spectrometer input. Novel-core-geometry fibers, in concert with dedicated optical double-scramblers, are often used to further homogenize and stabilize the telescope illumination pattern in both the image and pupil planes. However, these systems still demonstrate measurable sensitivity to incident illumination variations from the telescope and atmosphere. Furthermore, as spectral resolution requirements increase, the commensurate increase in instrument size becomes impractical. Thus, the community has turned to implementing image and pupil slicers to reformat the near or far fields of light entering the spectrometer by preferentially redistributing starlight exiting the fiber to maintain high spectral resolution, efficiency, and compact spectrometer size.","The NASA Strategic Plan (2018) and Space Mission Directorate Science Plan (2014) both call for discovery and characterization of habitable Earth analogs and the search for biosignatures on those worlds. These goals were endorsed and amplified upon in the recent National Academy of Science (NAS) Exoplanet Report, which emphasized that a knowledge of the orbits and masses is essential to the complete and correct characterization of potentially habitable worlds. PRV measurements are needed to follow up on the transiting worlds discovered by Kepler, K2, and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The interpretation of the transit spectra that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will obtain will depend on knowledge of a planet’s surface gravity, which comes from its radius (from the transit data) and its mass (from PRV measurements or, in some cases, transit timing variations). Without knowledge of a planet's mass, the interpretation of its spectrum is subject to many ambiguities. These ambiguities will only be exacerbated for the direct-imaging missions such as the proposed Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) and Large Ultraviolet Optical Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) flagships, which will obtain spectra of Earth analogs around a few tens to hundreds of stars. Even if a radius can be inferred from the planet's brightness and an estimate of its albedo, the lack of a dynamical mass precludes any knowledge of the planet's density, bulk composition, and surface gravity, which are needed to determine, for example, absolute gas column densities. Moreover, a fully characterized orbit is challenging to determine from just a few direct images and may even be confused in the presence of multiple planets. Is a planet in a highly eccentric orbit habitable or not? Only dynamical (PRV) measurements can provide such information. Thus, highly precise and highly stable PRV measurements are absolutely critical to the complete characterization of habitable worlds. The NAS report also noted that measurements from space might be a final option if the problem of telluric contamination cannot be solved. The Earth’s atmosphere will limit precise radial velocity measurements to ~10 cm/s at wavelengths longer than ~700 nm and greater than 30 cm/s at wavelengths >900 nm, making it challenging to mitigate the effects of stellar activity without a measurement of the color dependence due to stellar activity in the PRV time series. A space-based PRV mission, such as has been suggested in the NASA EarthFinder mission concept study, may be necessary. If so, the low SWaP technologies developed under this SBIR program could help enable space-based implementations of the PRV method.","

Focus Area 11 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,S3.05Terrestrial Balloons and Planetary Aerial Vehicles, GSFC," AFRC, JPL", 2021,Planetary Aerial Vehicles for Venus,"NASA is interested in scientific exploration of Venus using aerial vehicles to perform in situ investigations of its atmosphere, surface, and interior structure. The 2019 Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) Strategic Plan identified several key science objectives that are ideally suited to aerial platforms. The areas of scientific interest include:Atmospheric Gas Composition, Cloud and Haze Particle Characterization, Atmospheric Structure, Surface Imaging, and Geophysical Investigations.Venus features a challenging atmospheric environment that significantly impacts the design and operation of aerial vehicles. NASA is currently developing concepts for controlled-variable-altitude balloons with payloads of up to 200 kg operating at an altitude range between 52 and 62 km over a latitude range of 0° to +/-60°. Proposals for the following Venus aerial vehicle components are encouraged: (1) Entry, deployment, inflation technologies for a Venus balloon, (2) Instrument sondes, and (3) Helium transfer pump.The most critical phase of a Venus balloon mission is the transition from atmospheric entry to a free-flying configuration. Concepts for any or all of the critical phases of the transition are desired: deployment of the balloon from the atmospheric entry vehicle, inflation of the balloon, and separation of the balloon from the inflation system and parachute system. Deployment of instrument sondes from the payload could enhance and lengthen the balloon mission operating lifetime by reducing payload mass as lift capability is lost over time. Sondes with a mass up to 5 or 10 kg should be capable of operating for several hours, carry a small science instrument payload, and be able to communicate with the primary balloon mission. The sondes envisioned for this solicitation are categorized into ascending and descending investigations. Ascending science investigations carry small science payloads up to 70 km altitude, and descending science investigations carry a small science payload down to near the surface (i.e., <10 km altitude). Proposals offering both heavier-than-air and lighter-than-air (relative to the Venus atmosphere) solutions are solicited. Furthermore, the sonde concepts may have powered propulsion or unpowered flight. Suggested vehicle types include, but are not limited to: Solar-heated balloons that would operate on the sunlit side. This kind of sonde would be deployed from the payload gondola, auto-inflate in a free fall through the atmosphere, and attain float as the solar balloon heats from the Sun. This could possibly operate either above or below the primary balloon mission altitude range. Probes deployed from the payload gondola that perform stabilized vertical descents, gliding descents, powered ascents, or a combination of both ascents and descents.A controlled-variable-altitude balloon may use a pump to transfer helium from a zero-pressure balloon into a superpressure balloon. Pumping technologies capable of pumping helium with a pressure rise of 50 kPa at 100 liters per minute are desired. Multistage or parallel flow pump solutions are acceptable for consideration. Light weight and high efficiency are important factors in the pump since it must fly with the balloon payload.It is expected that a Phase I effort will consist of a system-level design and a proof-of-concept experiment on one or more key components. Proposers should be familiar with the atmospheric pressure, temperature, solar, infrared (IR) heating, and corrosion aspects of the Venus atmosphere as described in this call. The atmospheric temperature ranges from -30°C at 62 km to 62°C at 52 km, the pressure ranges from about 18 kPa at 62 km to 80 kPa at 52 km (Venus International Reference Atmosphere, VIRA [see Kliore, 1985]), the solar flux can be as high as 2,300 W/m2 at 62 km, and the IR heat flux coming up from the lower atmosphere can be as high as 830 W/m2 at 52 km [Crisp, 1986]. The sulfuric acid vapor abundance is less than less than 1 ppmv at 52 km and above [Oschlisniok, 2012]. The sulfuric acid liquid aerosols have a concentration between 75% (pH -1.5) and 90% (pH -2.0) [Titov, 2018]. Although the cloud droplets are highly acidic, they are very small, typically in the range of 1 to 10 µm in diameter, and fairly diffuse, with cloud droplet abundance only on the order of 100 droplets/cm3 for the 1-µm-sized particles; and on the order of 10 droplets/cm3 for the larger (r > 3µm) particles. The maximum observed aqueous H2SO4 content in the balloon operating environment is on the order of only 30 mg/m3 [Knollenberg, 1980].

State of the Art and Critical Gaps:

Wind speed measurements at balloon float altitudes have several benefits: First, a relative wind sensor will enable the TCS development by providing a means to measure the speed imparted to the balloon by a future TCS concept. Second, science gondolas with fine pointing requirements must point against the relative wind. Currently, a data set of example relative wind does not exist, which requires science groups to design robust control systems for their telescopes or instruments. Third, relative wind is responsible for any convective cooling seen on large structures, such as baffles on telescopes, which is currently poorly understood. In general, relative wind speed measurements will aide in prolonging flights (both with a TCS and by refining flight prediction capabilities) and enable more informed design of gondola structures and heating systems.



Commercially available wind speed sensors (anemometers) have been shown to not be capable of accurately measuring the wind speed above ~15 km in altitude. In addition, this technology (if realized) would enable the development of a trajectory control system for balloon missions, which is critical for achieving the goal of 100-day missions at 36 km in the Southern Hemisphere.

Relevance / Science Traceability:

A relative wind sensor for balloon missions would benefit the Science Mission Directorate (SMD)/Astrophysics mission by furthering the state of the art in sensor technology.

Focus Area 11 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,S3.05Terrestrial Balloons and Planetary Aerial Vehicles, GSFC," AFRC, JPL", 2021,Improved Downlink Satellite Communications for Balloons,"NASA is interested in scientific exploration of Venus using aerial vehicles to perform in situ investigations of its atmosphere, surface, and interior structure. The 2019 Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) Strategic Plan identified several key science objectives that are ideally suited to aerial platforms. The areas of scientific interest include:Atmospheric Gas Composition, Cloud and Haze Particle Characterization, Atmospheric Structure, Surface Imaging, and Geophysical Investigations.Venus features a challenging atmospheric environment that significantly impacts the design and operation of aerial vehicles. NASA is currently developing concepts for controlled-variable-altitude balloons with payloads of up to 200 kg operating at an altitude range between 52 and 62 km over a latitude range of 0° to +/-60°. Proposals for the following Venus aerial vehicle components are encouraged: (1) Entry, deployment, inflation technologies for a Venus balloon, (2) Instrument sondes, and (3) Helium transfer pump.The most critical phase of a Venus balloon mission is the transition from atmospheric entry to a free-flying configuration. Concepts for any or all of the critical phases of the transition are desired: deployment of the balloon from the atmospheric entry vehicle, inflation of the balloon, and separation of the balloon from the inflation system and parachute system. Deployment of instrument sondes from the payload could enhance and lengthen the balloon mission operating lifetime by reducing payload mass as lift capability is lost over time. Sondes with a mass up to 5 or 10 kg should be capable of operating for several hours, carry a small science instrument payload, and be able to communicate with the primary balloon mission. The sondes envisioned for this solicitation are categorized into ascending and descending investigations. Ascending science investigations carry small science payloads up to 70 km altitude, and descending science investigations carry a small science payload down to near the surface (i.e., <10 km altitude). Proposals offering both heavier-than-air and lighter-than-air (relative to the Venus atmosphere) solutions are solicited. Furthermore, the sonde concepts may have powered propulsion or unpowered flight. Suggested vehicle types include, but are not limited to: Solar-heated balloons that would operate on the sunlit side. This kind of sonde would be deployed from the payload gondola, auto-inflate in a free fall through the atmosphere, and attain float as the solar balloon heats from the Sun. This could possibly operate either above or below the primary balloon mission altitude range. Probes deployed from the payload gondola that perform stabilized vertical descents, gliding descents, powered ascents, or a combination of both ascents and descents.A controlled-variable-altitude balloon may use a pump to transfer helium from a zero-pressure balloon into a superpressure balloon. Pumping technologies capable of pumping helium with a pressure rise of 50 kPa at 100 liters per minute are desired. Multistage or parallel flow pump solutions are acceptable for consideration. Light weight and high efficiency are important factors in the pump since it must fly with the balloon payload.It is expected that a Phase I effort will consist of a system-level design and a proof-of-concept experiment on one or more key components. Proposers should be familiar with the atmospheric pressure, temperature, solar, infrared (IR) heating, and corrosion aspects of the Venus atmosphere as described in this call. The atmospheric temperature ranges from -30°C at 62 km to 62°C at 52 km, the pressure ranges from about 18 kPa at 62 km to 80 kPa at 52 km (Venus International Reference Atmosphere, VIRA [see Kliore, 1985]), the solar flux can be as high as 2,300 W/m2 at 62 km, and the IR heat flux coming up from the lower atmosphere can be as high as 830 W/m2 at 52 km [Crisp, 1986]. The sulfuric acid vapor abundance is less than less than 1 ppmv at 52 km and above [Oschlisniok, 2012]. The sulfuric acid liquid aerosols have a concentration between 75% (pH -1.5) and 90% (pH -2.0) [Titov, 2018]. Although the cloud droplets are highly acidic, they are very small, typically in the range of 1 to 10 µm in diameter, and fairly diffuse, with cloud droplet abundance only on the order of 100 droplets/cm3 for the 1-µm-sized particles; and on the order of 10 droplets/cm3 for the larger (r > 3µm) particles. The maximum observed aqueous H2SO4 content in the balloon operating environment is on the order of only 30 mg/m3 [Knollenberg, 1980].

Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) and Iridium satellite communications are currently used for balloon payload applications. A commercial S-band TDRSS transceiver and a mechanically steered 18-dBi-gain antenna provide 150 kbps continuous downlink. TDRSS K-band transceivers are available but are currently cost prohibitive. Open port Iridium service is also in use, but the operational cost is high per byte transferred.","Science Mission Directorate (SMD) - NASA HQ (Astrophysics Division) enables multiple Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Science (ROSES) opportunities, Small Explorer (SMEX) Announcement of Opportunity (AO) (Astrophysics), Astrophysics Mission of Opportunity, and Hands-On Project Experience (HOPE) (annually).Improvements to satellite communications for research balloons would enable greater and better data collection, possibly extended flight duration, and other such potential benefits.","

Desired Deliverables Description:

Phase I: Deliver a conceptual design package for a prototype unit that meets the design goals and accuracy. Phase II: Deliver a prototype and an accompanying acceptance package that describes the prototype unit in detail and provides experimental validation of the unit having met the design goals and accuracy as well as all accompanying software/firmware required for operation of the sensor.

State of the Art and Critical Gaps:

Wind speed measurements at balloon float altitudes have several benefits: First, a relative wind sensor will enable the TCS development by providing a means to measure the speed imparted to the balloon by a future TCS concept. Second, science gondolas with fine pointing requirements must point against the relative wind. Currently, a data set of example relative wind does not exist, which requires science groups to design robust control systems for their telescopes or instruments. Third, relative wind is responsible for any convective cooling seen on large structures, such as baffles on telescopes, which is currently poorly understood. In general, relative wind speed measurements will aide in prolonging flights (both with a TCS and by refining flight prediction capabilities) and enable more informed design of gondola structures and heating systems.



Commercially available wind speed sensors (anemometers) have been shown to not be capable of accurately measuring the wind speed above ~15 km in altitude. In addition, this technology (if realized) would enable the development of a trajectory control system for balloon missions, which is critical for achieving the goal of 100-day missions at 36 km in the Southern Hemisphere.

It is anticipated that these products are achievable given the SBIR time and funding constraints.The deliverables for Phase II includes an engineering development unit and testing with a report of the results.","A scientific balloon floats at an average altitude of 110,000 ft or more and carries science payloads up to 8,000 lb. At the end of a scientific balloon mission, the science payload on the gondola (from this point on “science gondola”) is separated from the balloon and falls to Earth on a parachute following the wind currents at the time of release and lands on cardboard crush pads. In most cases this allows recovery of the science gondola, though the payload and gondola may be in areas that are hard to reach using conventional recovery trucks. However, there are rare cases where the science gondola falls either in water or in areas that require special equipment or are difficult for recovery (e.g., inaccessible area).Currently, trajectory predictions for termination are within a few miles and are dependent on models, map overlays (showing restricted air space, national/state parks), and observations from a plane on areas along the trajectory to determine the best area to terminate the balloon and bring the science gondola safely to the ground. Some items that are considered during the termination discussions are science mission minimums, trajectory predications (e.g., national or state parks, lakes, mountains, rivers, infrastructure, crop lands), weather conditions, and risk to the public. Current state of the art does not include steerable systems in balloon parachutes. Success in this endeavor will entail primarily steerability, but this also results frequently in a safety analysis, which will allow more “green lights” for launch than would otherwise be the case.","This subtopic will be relevant to any mission directorate, commercial entity, or other government agency that drops payloads from an altitude, including the Balloon Program. Other potentially interested projects include NASA sounding rockets, UAV, and aircraft programs.","

Minimize required mass/volume/power as well as development cost/schedule resources. Can operate reliably in the expected thermal and radiation environments.Successful proposal concepts should significantly advance the state of the art. Furthermore, proposals developing hardware should indicate an understanding of the intended operating environment, including temperature and radiation. Note that environmental requirements vary significantly from mission to mission. For example, some low-Earth-orbit missions have a total ionizing dose (TID) radiation requirement of less than 10 krad(Si), whereas planetary missions can have requirements well in excess of 1 Mrad(Si).Specific technologies sought by this subtopic include:Radiation-hardened mixed-signal structured application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) platforms to enable miniaturized and low-power science sensor readout and control, with sufficient capability to implement 12-bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs) monotonic and 12- to 16-bit digital-to-analog converters (ADCs) (<100 kHz 16-bit and 1 to 2 MHz 12-bit) and also charge-sensitive amplifiers for solid-state detectors and readout integrated circuit (ROIC) for silicon photomultipliers. Radiation-hardened ASIC devices to enable direct capture of analog waveforms. Multiple-output point-of-load power regulator: This module, preferably implemented utilizing one or more controller ASICs, will source a minimum of three settable output voltages when provided with an input voltage between +5 and +12 V. Output voltages shall be independently settable to any voltage between 3.3 and 0.9 V with efficiency of at least 95%. Regulation, noise filtering, and other operational specifications should be commensurate with industry standards for space-based systems. Output current in the 10 A range to handle field-programmable gate array (FPGA) core requirements. The module should provide standard spacecraft power supply features, including overvoltage protection, fault tolerance, load monitoring, sequencing, synchronization, and soft start and should allow control and status monitoring by a remote power system controller. Using fewer external components is also highly desirable. There is also interest in a capability to provide data over power line communication to the converter for control and monitoring functions. The offeror should determine radiation-tolerance levels achievable utilizing commercially available processes and indicate, in the proposal, the radiation-tolerance goals. High-density high-reliability interconnections: A high-reliability connector or interconnect mechanism that can operate in space environments (vacuum, vibration) and deliver hundreds of signal/power connections while using as little physical board area as possible is desired. The connector wiring and cabling in addition to the connector shape and size should be considered in providing a complete system that further reduces the size and weight of the harnessing. The design should handle everything from carrying power to high-speed (10+ Gbps) impedance-controlled connections. The design should be scalable in different sizes to accommodate fewer connections and save board space. Low insertion force is desirable. Right angle and stacking design options should be considered.",3 to 5,"Level 1: TX 08 Sensors and Instruments

Hardware
Software","Desired Phase I deliverables include designs, simulations, and analyses to demonstrate viability of proposed components.Desired Phase II deliverables:For mixed-signal structured ASIC platforms—include a prototype mixed-signal ASIC implemented with a proof-of-concept end-user design. The proof-of-concept design should demonstrate the stated performance capabilities of the ASIC. For the direct analog waveform capture ASIC—should include a prototype ASIC device implemented on a test board and demonstration of the wave form capture capabilities of the device. For the multiple output point of load switcher—a prototype multi-output point of load regulator. The regulator should be integrated onto a test board and be performance tested under varying resistive, capacitive, and transient load conditions. For the high density high-reliability interconnect—prototypes of the connection system (different size, orientations, wiring, etc.). The connector should be integrated onto a test board where its performance (speed, cross talk, etc.) can be verified.","There is a need for a broader range of mixed-signal structured ASIC architectures. This includes the need for viable options for mixed ASICs with high-resolution, low-noise analog elements, especially 12-bit DACs and 12- to 16-bit ADCs. The current selection of mixed-signal structured ASICs is limited to 10-bit designs, which do not provide the accuracy or resolution to perform the science required of many of the instruments currently being flown. Mixed-signal structured ASICs can integrate many functions and therefore can save considerable size, weight, and power over discrete solutions—significantly benefiting NASA missions. The lack of parts with high-precision analog is greatly limiting their current application.There are multiple output point-of-load converters available from commercial companies. The existing commercial parts require many external components, eliminating their space savings. Commercial parts are not built on radiation-tolerant processes.Current connectors and interconnect harnessing are too large, especially for small satellites and CubeSats. As the size of the printed circuit boards has shrunk, the percent of board space being used by the input/output (I/O) connectors has become unacceptable. The connectors are taking away from circuitry and sensors that could be providing additional functionality and science products. High-density commercial connectors tend to be lacking in their general ruggedness, outgassing, and ability to prevent intermittent connections in high-vibration environments like orbital launches.","Mixed-signal structured ASIC architectures are relevant to increasing science return and lowering costs for missions across all Science Mission Directorate (SMD) divisions. However, the benefits are most significant for miniaturized instruments and subsystems that must operate in harsh environments. These missions include interplanetary CubeSats and SmallSats, outer planets instruments, and heliophysics missions to harsh radiation environments. For all missions, the higher accuracy would provide better science or allow additional science through the higher density integration.Multi-output point-of-load converters and high-density high-reliability interconnects are relevant to miniaturizing electronics. Miniaturized flight electronics allows one to fit more functionality into less volume, allowing smaller spacecraft to perform science that was previously done by larger satellites. These missions include interplanetary CubeSats and SmallSats, outer planets instruments, and heliophysics missions.","

Focus Area 11 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,S4.03Spacecraft Technology for Sample Return Missions, JPL," GRC, GSFC", 2021,Critical Technologies for Sample-Return Missions,"This Subtopic focuses on robotic sample-return (SR) missions that require landing on large bodies (e.g., Luna, Mars Sample Return (MSR)), as opposed to particulate-class SR missions (e.g., Genesis, Hayabusa) or touch-and-go (TAG) missions to relatively small asteroids or comets (e.g., OSIRIS-Rex, Hayabusa2). The mission destinations envisioned are dwarf planets (e.g., Vesta, Ceres) and planet or planet moons (e.g., Phobos, Europa). These are the most challenging missions in NASA's portfolio but also the most scientifically promising, given the vast array of instruments available on Earth to study the retrieved samples. The challenges associated with these SR missions may be grouped into four categories: (1) Mass-efficient spacecraft architectures (e.g., efficient propulsion or materials that significantly reduce the mass of the launch payload required), (2) Sample handling (e.g., subsurface acquisition mechanisms), (3) Sample integrity (e.g., surviving reentry), and (4) Planetary protection/contamination control (PP/CC) (e.g., preventing leakage into the orbital sample (OS) canister). This Subtopic seeks potential solutions to areas (1), (3), and (4), considering it best that technologies associated with (2), sample handling, be directed to Subtopic S4.02. The intent is to have this Subtopic S4.03 manage only those technologies in areas (1), (3), and (4) that are specifically related to SR missions; technology solutions related to other classes of missions should instead be directed to Subtopics S4.04 (Extreme Environments) and S4.05 (Contamination Control and Planetary Protection).The heightened need for mass-efficient solutions in these SR missions stems from their extreme payload mass “gear ratio.” For example, the entire MSR campaign will require three heavy launch vehicle launches with rough spacecraft mass of 5,000 kg each in order to bring back multiple samples with an estimated total mass of 0.5 kg. Clearly, any mass savings in the ascent vehicle’s gross liftoff mass (GLOM) or in the lander mass, for example, would yield many times more savings in the launch payload mass, enhancing the feasibility of these missions.Once acquired, samples must be structurally and thermally preserved through safe landing and transport to Johnson Space Center (JSC) for analyses. Sample integrity technology solutions that address the long, high-radiation return trip, as well as the dynamic and high-temperature environment of reentry, are sought. Potential solutions include near isotropic and crushable high-strength energy-absorbent materials that can withstand the ballistic impact landing. Materials that offer thermal isolation in addition to energy absorption are highly desirable given the reentry environment. In the case of cryogenically preserved samples, the technical challenge includes development of thermal control systems to ensure volatiles are conserved.Finally, acquired samples must be chemically and biologically preserved in their original condition. Examples of PP/CC technology solutions sought include:Materials selection: selection of metallic materials (non-organic) for the interior of the OS capsule as well as materials that allow preferable surface treatments and bake-out sterilization approaches. Surface science topics: Adsorber coatings/materials for contaminant adsorption (getter-type materials, such as aluminum oxide, porous polymer resin) and/or low-surface-energy materials to minimize contaminant deposition. Characterization of contamination sources on lander, rover, capsule, ascent vehicle, and orbiter, for design of adequate mitigation measures.",3 to 6,"Level 1: TX 04 Robotics Systems

Prototype","A Phase I deliverable would be a final report that describes the requisite research and detailed design accomplished under the project.A Phase II deliverable would be successful demonstration of an appropriate-TRL performance test, such as at representative scale and environment, along with all the supporting analyses, design, and hardware specifications.","The kind of SR missions targeted in this solicitation are those that require landing on an extraterrestrial body. This most challenging kind of SR mission has only been successfully done in the Soviet Luna program that returned 326 g of Moon samples in three missions—out of eleven attempts—in the early 1970s. Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS-Rex are TAG SR missions that are expected to return samples in December 2020 from asteroid Ryugu and in September 2023 from asteroid Bennu, respectively. The first segment of NASA's MSR mission is the sample collection rover Perseverance, launch of which took place in July 2020. The MSR sample retrieval segment (lander, fetch rover, Mars Ascent Vehicle) is scheduled to begin Phase A development in October 2020 for a 2026 launch. The third MSR segment will be ESA's Earth return vehicle (ERV).The content and breath of this Solicitation is informed by lessons learned in MSR over the Pre-Phase A years. Future SR missions are in need of technology improvements in each of the critical areas targeted: mass efficiency, sample acquisition, sample integrity, and planetary protection.This solicitation seeks proposals that have the potential to increase the Technology Readiness Level from 3 or 4 to 6 within 5 years, and within the cost constraints of the Phases I, II, and III of this SBIR Program. Such progress would allow full flight qualification of the resulting hardware within 5 to 10 years.","Medium- and large-class SR missions address fundamental science questions such as whether there is evidence of ancient life or prebiotic chemistry in the sampled body. Table S.1 of Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022 (2011) correlates ten ""Priority Questions"" drawn from three Crosscutting Science Themes, with ""Missions in the Recommended Plan that Address Them"". SR missions are shown to address eight out of the ten questions and cover every crosscutting theme, including Building New Worlds, Planetary Habitats, and Workings of Solar Systems.","

Focus Area 11 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,S4.04Extreme Environments Technology, JPL," GRC, GSFC, LaRC", 2021,Extreme Environments Technology,"This subtopic addresses NASA's need to develop technologies for producing space systems that can operate without environmental protection housing in the extreme environments of NASA missions. Key performance parameters of interest are survivability and operation under the following conditions:Very low temperature environments (e.g., temperatures at the surface of Titan and of other Ocean Worlds as low as -180 °C; and in permanently shadowed craters on the Moon). Combination of low-temperature and radiation environments (e.g., surface conditions at Europa of -180 °C with very high radiation). Very high temperature, high pressure, and chemically corrosive environments (e.g., Venus surface conditions, having very high pressure and temperature of 486 °C).NASA is interested in expanding its ability to explore the deep atmospheres and surfaces of planets, asteroids, and comets through the use of long-lived (days or weeks) balloons and landers. Survivability in extreme high temperatures and high pressures is also required for deep atmospheric probes to the giant planets. Proposals are sought for technologies that are suitable for remote-sensing applications at cryogenic temperatures and in situ atmospheric and surface explorations in the high-temperature, high-pressure environment at the Venusian surface (485 °C, 93 atm) or in low-temperature environments such as those of Titan (-180 °C), Europa (-220 °C), Ganymede (-200 °C), Mars, the Moon, asteroids, comets, and other small bodies.Also, Europa-Jupiter missions may have a mission life of 10 years, and the radiation environment is estimated at 2.9 Mrad total ionizing dose (TID) behind 0.1-in-thick aluminum. Proposals are sought for technologies that enable NASA's long-duration missions to extreme wide-temperature and cosmic radiation environments. High reliability, ease of maintenance, low volume, low mass, and low outgassing characteristics are highly desirable. Special interest lies in development of the following technologies that are suitable for the environments discussed above:Wide-temperature-range precision mechanisms: for example, beam-steering, scanner, linear, and tilting multi-axis mechanisms. Radiation-tolerant/radiation-hardened low-power, low-noise, mixed-signal mechanism control electronics for precision actuators and sensors. Wide-temperature-range feedback sensors with sub-arcsecond/nanometer precision. Long-life, long-stroke, low-power, and high-torque force actuators with sub-arc-second/nanometer precision. Long-life bearings/tribological surfaces/lubricants. High-temperature analog and digital electronics, electronic components, and in-circuit energy storage (capacitors, inductors, etc.) elements. High-temperature actuators and gear boxes for robotic arms and other mechanisms. Low-power and wide-operating-temperature radiation-tolerant/radiation-hardened radio-frequency (RF) electronics. Radiation-tolerant/radiation-hardened low-power/ultra-low-power, wide-operating-temperature, low-noise mixed-signal electronics for space-borne systems such as guidance and navigation avionics and instruments. Radiation-tolerant/radiation-hardened wide-operating-temperature power electronics. Radiation-tolerant/radiation-hardened electronic packaging (including shielding, passives, connectors, wiring harness, and materials used in advanced electronics assembly).Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II hardware demonstration, and when possible, deliver a demonstration unit for functional and environmental testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.",3 to 5,"Level 1: TX 04 Robotics Systems

Analysis",Provide research and analysis for Phase I as a final report.Deliverables for Phase II include proof-of-concept working prototypes that demonstrate the innovations defined in the proposal and enable direct operation in extreme environments.,"Future NASA missions to high-priority targets in our solar system will require systems that have to operate at extreme environmental conditions. NASA missions to the surfaces of Europa and other Ocean Worlds bodies will be exposed to temperatures as low as -180 °C and radiation levels that are at megarad levels. Operation in permanently shadowed craters on the Moon is also a region of particular interest. In addition, NASA missions to the Venus surface and deep atmospheric probes to Jupiter or Saturn will be exposed to high temperatures, high pressures, and chemically corrosive environments.Current state-of-practice for development of space systems for the above missions is to place hardware developed with conventional technologies into bulky and power-inefficient environmentally protected housings. The use of environmental protection housing will severely increase the mass of the space system and limit the life of the mission and the corresponding science return. This solicitation seeks to change the state of the practice by support technologies that will enable development of lightweight, highly efficient systems that can readily survive and operate in these extreme environments without the need for the environmental protection systems.","Relevance to SMD (Science Mission Directorate) is high.Low-temperature survivability is required for surface missions to Titan (-180 °C), Europa (-220 °C), Ganymede (-200 °C), small bodies, and comets. Mars diurnal temperatures range from -120 °C to +20 °C. For the Europa Clipper baseline concept with a mission life of 10 years, the radiation environment is estimated at 2.9 Mrad TID behind 0.1-in-thick aluminum. Lunar equatorial region temperatures swing from -180 °C to +130 °C during the lunar day/night cycle, and shadowed lunar pole temperatures can drop to -230 °C.Advanced technologies for high-temperature systems (electronics, electromechanical, and mechanical) and pressure vessels are needed to ensure NASA can meet its long-duration (days instead of hours) life target for its science missions that operate in high-temperature and high-pressure environments.","

Focus Area 11 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,S4.05Contamination Control and Planetary Protection, JPL," GRC, GSFC, LaRC", 2021,CC and PP Implementation and Verification,"The planetary protection (PP) and contamination control (CC) subtopic focuses on mission-enabling and capability-driven technologies to improve NASA's ability to prevent forward and backward contamination. Forward contamination is the transfer of viable organisms from Earth to another body. Backward contamination is the transfer of material posing a biological threat back to Earth's biosphere. NASA is seeking innovative technologies or applications of technologies to facilitate meeting portions of forward and backward contamination requirements to include:Improvements to spacecraft cleaning and sterilization that remain compatible with spacecraft materials and assemblies. Prevention of recontamination and cross contamination throughout the spacecraft lifecycle. improvements to detection and verification of organic compounds and biologicals on spacecraft, to include microbial detection and assessments for viable organism and deoxyribonucleic-acid- (DNA-) based verification technologies to encompass sampling devices, sample processing, and sample analysis pipelines. Active in situ recontamination/decontamination approaches (e.g., in situ heating of sample containers to drive off volatiles prior to sample collection) and in situ/in-flight sterilization approaches (e.g., UV or plasma) for surfaces. Enabling end-to-end sample return functions to assure containment and pristine preservation of materials gathered on NASA missions. For CC efforts, understanding contaminants and preventing contamination supports the preservation of sample science integrity and ensures spacecraft function nominally. NASA is seeking analytical and physics-based modeling technologies and techniques to quantify and validate submicron particulate contamination, low-energy surface material coatings to prevent contamination, and modeling and analysis of particles to ensure hardware and instrumentation meet organic contamination requirements.

The predominant means to control biological contamination on spacecraft surfaces is using some combination of heat microbial reduction processing and solvent cleaning (e.g., isopropyl alcohol cleaning). Notably, vapor hydrogen peroxide is a NASA-approved process, but the variability of the hydrogen peroxide concentration, delivery mechanism, and material compatibility concerns still tends to be a hurdle to infuse it on a flight mission with complex hardware and multiple materials for a given component. Upon microbial reduction, the hardware then is protected in a cleanroom environment (ISO 8 or better) using protective coverings when hardware is not being assembled or tested. Biological cleanliness is then verified through the NASA standard assay, which is a culture-based method. Rapid cleanliness assessments can be performed, but are not currently accepted as a verification methodology, to inform engineering staff about biological cleanliness during critical hardware assembly or tests that include the total adenosine triphosphate (tATP) and limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) assays. Terminal sterilization has been conducted with recontamination prevention for in-flight biobarriers employed for the entire spacecraft (Viking) or a spacecraft subsystem (Phoenix spacecraft arm). In addition to the hardware developed approaches for compliance, environmental assessments are implemented to understand recontamination potential for cleanroom surfaces and air. Although the NASA standard assay is performed on the cleanroom surfaces, DNA-based methodologies have been adopted to include 16S and 18S ribosomal-ribonucleic-acid- (rRNA-) targeted sequencing, while metagenomic approaches are currently undergoing development. Thus, the critical PP gaps include the assessment of DNA from low-biomass surfaces (<0.1 ng/µL DNA, using current technologies, from 1 to 5 m2 of surface), sampling devices that are suitable for low biomass and compounds (e.g., viable organisms, DNA) but also compliant with cleanroom and electrostatic discharge limits, quantification of the widest spectrum of viable organisms, enhanced microbial reduction/sterilization modalities that are compatible with flight materials, and a ground- and flight-based recontamination systems.CC requirements and practices are also evolving rapidly as mission science objectives targeting detection of organics and life are driving stricter requirements and improved characterization of flight-system- and science-instrument-induced contamination. State-of-the-art CC includes:Testing and measurement of outgassing rates down to 3.0×1015 g/cm2/s with massspectrometry, under flight conditions (low and high operating temperatures) and with combined exposure to natural environment (high-energy radiation, ultraviolet radiation, atomic oxygen exposure). Particulate transport modeling and analysis for continuum, rarefied, and molecular flow environments with electrostatic, vibro-acoustic, particle detachment and attachment capabilities. Modeling and analysis of molecular return flux using direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) and the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) formulations.","Protection requirements has emerged in recent years with increased interest in investigating bodies with the potential for life detection such as Europa, Enceladus, Mars, etc. and the potential for sample return from such bodies. The development of such technologies would enable missions to be able to be responsive to PP requirements as they would be able to assess viable organisms and establish microbial reduction technologies to achieve acceptable microbial bioburden levels for sensitive life detection instruments to prevent inadvertent “false positives,” to ensure compliance sample return planetary protection and science requirements, and to provide a means to comply with probabilistic-based planetary protection requirements for biologically sensitive missions (e.g., outer planets and sample return).","

"Focus Area 12 Entry, Descent, and Landing Systems",H5.02Hot Structure Technology for Aerospace Vehicles, MSFC," AFRC, JSC, LaRC", 2021,Hot Structures Technology for Aerospace Vehicles,"This subtopic deals with the development of reusable nonmetallic hot structure technology for structural components exposed to extreme heating environments on aerospace vehicles. Desired hot structure systems encompass multifunctional structures that can reduce or eliminate the need for active cooling or separate thermal protection system (TPS) materials. The potential advantages of using hot structure systems in place of actively cooled structures or a TPS with underlying cool structure include reduced mass, increased mission performance (such as reusability), improved aerodynamics for aeroshell components, improved structural efficiency, and increased ability for nondestructive inspections. Hot structure is an enabling technology for reusability between missions or mission phases, such as advanced propulsion systems requiring multiple engine firings and vehicles requiring aerocapture/aerobraking followed by entry, descent, and landing. The development of hot structure technology for (a) combustion-device liquid rocket engine propulsion systems and (b) aerodynamic structures for aeroshells, control surfaces, wing leading edges, and heatshields is of great interest. Examples of prior flight-proven hot structures include: (a) the nozzle extension for the Centaur RL10B-2 upper-stage rocket engine, and (b) wing leading edges and control surfaces for the Space Shuttle Orbiter, Hyper-X (X-43A), and/or X-37B.This subtopic seeks to develop innovative, low-cost, damage-tolerant, reusable, and lightweight fiber-reinforced hot structure technology applicable to aerospace vehicles and components exposed to extreme temperatures. At a minimum, materials developed under this subtopic should be capable of operating at a temperature of at least 1,371 °C (2,500 °F)—higher temperatures are of even greater interest, such as up to 2,204+ °C (4,000+ °F). These aerospace vehicle applications are unique in requiring the hot structure to carry primary structure vehicle loads and to be reusable after exposure to extreme temperatures during liquid rocket engine firings and/or atmospheric entry. The material systems of interest for use in developing hot structure technology include advanced carbon-carbon (C-C) and ceramic matrix composite (CMC) materials. Potential applications of interest for hot structure technology include: (a) propulsion system components (hot-gas valves, combustion chambers, and nozzle extensions), and (b) primary load-carrying aeroshell structures, control surfaces, leading edges, and heatshields.Proposals should present approaches to address the current need for improvements in operating temperature capability, toughness/durability, reusability, and material system properties, as well as the need to reduce cost and manufacturing time requirements. Focus areas should address one or more of the following:Improvements in manufacturing processes and/or material designs to achieve repeatable uniform material properties, while minimizing data scatter, that are representative of actual vehicle components: specifically, material property data obtained from flat-panel test coupons should correlate directly to the properties of prototype and flight test articles.Material/structural architectures and multifunctional systems providing significant toughness and/or durability improvements over typical 2D interlaminar mechanical properties while maintaining in-plane and thermal properties when compared to state-of-the-art C-C or CMC materials. Examples include incorporating through-the-thickness stitching, braiding, or 3D woven preforms. Advancements in oxidation protection that enhance durability are also of interest: matrix inhibition, oxidation resistant matrices, exterior environmental coatings, etc.Manufacturing process methods that enable a significant reduction in the cost and time required to fabricate materials and components. There is a great need to reduce cost and processing time for hot structure materials and components – current state-of-the-art materials are typically expensive and have fabrication times often in the range of 6 to 12 months, which can limit or exclude the use of such materials. Approaches enabling reduced costs and manufacturing times should not lead, however, to significant reductions in material properties. Advanced manufacturing methods may include but are not limited to the following: (a) rapid densification cycles, (b) high char-yield resins, (c) additive manufacturing (AM), and (d) automated weaving, braiding, layup, etc.",2 to 4,"Level 1: TX 12 Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems, and Manufacturing

Research
Analysis","Research, testing, and analysis should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards Phase II hardware demonstrations. Phase I feasibility studies should also address cost and the risks associated with the hot structures technology.In addition to the final report, delivery of a representative sample(s) of the material and/or technology addressed by the Phase I project should be provided at the conclusion of the Phase I contract—for example: (a) coupons appropriate for thermal and/or mechanical material property tests, or (b) arc-jet test specimens. Plans for potential Phase II contracts should include the delivery of manufacturing demonstration units to NASA or a Commercial Space industry partner during Phase II. Testing of such test articles should be a part of the anticipated Phase II effort. Depending upon the emphasis of the Phase II work, such test articles may include subscale nozzle-extension test articles or arc-jet test specimens/hot structure components.","The current state of the art for composite hot structure components is limited primarily to applications with maximum use temperatures in the 1,093 to 1,593 °C (2,000 to 2,900 °F) range. While short excursions to higher temperatures are possible, considerable degradation may occur. Reusability is limited and may require considerable inspection before reuse. Critical gaps or technology needs include:(a) increasing operating temperatures to 1,649 to 2,204+ °C (3,000 to 4,000+ °F); (b) increasing resistance to environmental attack (primarily oxidation); (c) increasing manufacturing technology capabilities to improve reliability, repeatability, and quality control; (d) increasing durability/toughness and interlaminar mechanical properties (or introducing 3D architectures); (e) decreasing cost, and (f) decreasing overall manufacturing time required.","Hot structure technology is relevant to the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD), where the technology can be infused into spacecraft and launch vehicle applications. Such technology should provide either improved performance or enable advanced missions requiring reusability, increased damage tolerance, and the durability to withstand long-duration space exploration missions. The ability to allow for delivery and/or return of larger payloads to various space destinations, such as the lunar South Pole, is also of great interest.The Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) Program would be ideal for further funding a prototype hot structure system and technology demonstration effort. Commercial Space programs, such as Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS), Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS), and Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP), are also interested in this technology for flight vehicles. Additionally, NASA HEOMD programs that could use this technology include the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Human Landing System (HLS) for propulsion applications.Potential NASA users of this technology exist for a variety of propulsion systems, including the following:Upper-stage engine systems, such as those for the Artemis SLS.In-space propulsion systems, including nuclear thermal propulsion systems.Lunar/Mars lander descent/ascent propulsion systems.Propulsion systems for the Commercial Space industry, which is partnering with and supporting NASA efforts.Finally, the U.S. Air Force is interested in such technology for its National Security Space Launch (NSSL), ballistic missile, and hypersonic vehicle programs. Other non-NASA users include the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Army, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The subject technology can be both enhancing to systems already in use or under development, as well as enabling for applications that may not be feasible without further advancements in high temperature composites technology.","

These simulations, which solve the multispecies, multitemperature Navier-Stokes equations, require detailed models of the chemical and thermal nonequilibrium processes that take place in high-temperature shock layers. Numerical solution of these models results in a large system of highly nonlinear equations that are exceptionally stiff and difficult to solve efficiently. As a result, aerothermal simulations routinely consume 20 to 50 times the compute resources required by more conventional supersonic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, limiting the number of simulations delivered in a typical engineering design cycle to only a few dozen. Moreover, entry system designs are rapidly increasing in complexity, and unsteady flow phenomena such as supersonic retropropulsion are becoming critical considerations in their design. This increases the compute resources required for aerothermal simulation by an additional one to two orders of magnitude, which precludes the delivery of such simulations in engineering-relevant timescales.In order to deliver the aerothermal simulations required for NASA’s next generation of entry systems, access to greatly expanded compute resources is required. However, scaling up conventional central processing unit (CPU-) based supercomputers is problematic due to cost and power constraints. Many-core accelerators, such as Nvidia’s general-purpose graphical processing units (GPGPUs), offer increased compute capability with reduced cost and power requirements and are seeing rapid adoption in top-end supercomputers. As of June 2020, 144 of the top 500 fastest supercomputers leveraged accelerators or co-processors, including 6 of the top 10 [1]. All three of the U.S. Department of Energy’s upcoming exascale supercomputers will be accelerated using GPGPUs [2]. NASA has deployed Nvidia v100 GPGPUs to the Pleiades supercomputer [3]. Critically, NASA’s aerothermal simulation tools are fundamentally unable to run on many-core accelerators, and must be reengineered from the ground up to efficiently exploit such devices.This scope seeks to revolutionize NASA’s aerothermal analysis capability by developing novel simulation tools capable of efficiently targeting the advanced computational accelerators that are rapidly becoming standard in the world’s fastest supercomputers. A successful solution within this scope would demonstrate efficient simulation of a large-scale aerothermal problem of relevance on an advanced many-core architecture, for example, the Nvidia Volta GPGPU, using a prototype software package.",2 to 4,"Level 1: TX 09 Entry, Descent, and Landing

Software","The desired deliverable at the conclusion of Phase I is a prototype software package capable of solving the multispecies, multitemperature, reacting Euler equations on an advanced many-core accelerator such as an Nvidia v100 GPGPU. Parallelization across multiple accelerators and across nodes is not required. The solver shall demonstrate offloading of all primary compute kernels to the accelerator, but may do so in a nonoptimal fashion, for example, using managed memory, serializing communication and computation, etc. Some noncritical kernels such as boundary condition evaluation may still be performed on a CPU. The solver shall demonstrate kernel speedups (excluding memory transfer time) when comparing a single accelerator to a modern CPU-based, dual-socket compute node. However, overall application speedup is not expected at this stage. The solver shall be demonstrated for a relevant planetary entry vehicle such as FIRE-II, Apollo, Orion, or the Mars Science Laboratory.A successful Phase II deliverable will mature the Phase I prototype into a product ready for mission use and commercialization. Kernels for evaluating viscous fluxes shall be added, enabling computation of laminar convective heat transfer to the vehicle. Parallelization across multiple accelerators and multiple compute nodes shall be added. Good weak scaling shall be demonstrated for large 3D simulations (>10M grid cells). The implementation shall be sufficiently optimized to achieve an ~5x reduction in time-to-solution compared to NASA's Data-Parallel Line Relaxation (DPLR) aerothermal simulation code, assuming each dual-socket compute node is replaced by a single accelerator (i.e., delivered software running on eight GPGPUs shall be 5 times faster than DPLR running on eight modern, dual-socket compute nodes). Finally, the accuracy of the delivered software shall be verified by comparing to the DPLR and/or LAURA codes. The verification study shall consider flight conditions from at least two of the following planetary destinations: Earth, Mars, Titan, Venus, and Uranus/Neptune.","NASA’s existing aerothermal analysis codes (LAURA, DPLR, US3D, etc.) all utilize domain-decomposition strategies to implement coarse-grained, distributed-memory parallelization across hundreds or thousands of conventional CPU cores. These codes are fundamentally unable to efficiently exploit many-core accelerators, which require the use of fine-grained, shared-memory parallelism over hundreds of thousands of compute elements. Addressing this gap requires reengineering our tools from the ground up and developing new algorithms that expose more parallelism and scale well to small grain sizes.Many-core accelerated CFD solvers exist in academia, industry, and government. Notable examples are PyFR from Imperial College London [4], the Ansys Fluent commercial solver [5], and NASA Langley’s FUN3D code, which recently demonstrated a 30x improvement in node-level performance using Nvidia v100 GPUs [6]. However, nearly all previous work has focused on perfect gas flow models, which have different algorithmic and resource requirements compared to real gas models. The Sandia Parallel Aerodynamics and Reentry Code (SPARC) solver is the only project of note to have demonstrated efficient real-gas capability at scale using many-core accelerators [7].","This scope is directly relevant to NASA space missions in both HEOMD and SMD with an entry, descent, and landing (EDL) segment. These missions depend on aerothermal CFD to define critical flight environments and would derive large, recurring benefits from a more responsive and scalable simulation capability. This scope also has potential cross-cutting benefits for tools used by ARMD to simulate airbreathing hypersonic vehicles. Furthermore, this scope directly supports NASA’s CFD Vision 2030 Study, which calls for sustained investment to ensure that NASA’s computational aeroscience capabilities can effectively utilize the massively parallel, heterogeneous (i.e., GPU-accelerated) supercomputers expected to be the norm in 2030.","

Software","The desired deliverable at the conclusion of Phase I is a prototype software package capable of solving the two-dimensional, multispecies, multitemperature, reacting Euler equations on unstructured triangular grids at planetary entry velocities (>7 km/s). The software shall demonstrate robust capturing of the bow shock ahead of a simple cylinder at a variety of flight conditions without requiring adjustment of algorithm parameters, for example, artificial viscosity scale factors. The postshock flow field shall be free of the numerical noise in the entropy field, which is typical of conventional second-order finite volume schemes on triangular grids. Convergence to machine precision shall be demonstrated for all calculations.A successful Phase II deliverable will mature the Phase I prototype into a product ready for use on mission-relevant engineering problems. Extension to the laminar, multispecies, multitemperature Navier-Stokes equations shall be implemented. Extension to three spatial dimensions using unstructured tetrahedral grids shall be implemented, with efficient multinode parallelization targeting modern high-performance computing (HPC) platforms such as the NASA Pleiades supercomputer. The software shall be demonstrated on a range of planetary entry problems that include at least two of the following destinations: Earth, Mars, Titan, Venus, and Uranus/Neptune. Surface heat flux predictions shall be verified by comparison with NASA's DPLR and/or LAURA simulation codes, and must be free of numerical noise typically observed when using second-order finite volume codes on unstructured tetrahedral grids. Computational performance, as measured by total time-to-solution for a given heat flux accuracy, shall be characterized and compared to DPLR/LAURA, but no specific performance targets are required.","Multiple academic [4][5][6][7] and NASA [8] groups have demonstrated promising results when using high-order DG/finite element methods (FEMs) to perform steady-state aerothermodynamic analysis at conditions relevant to planetary entry. The bulk of these studies were conducted using structured grids with some degree of shock alignment (though not sufficient alignment to support a second-order finite volume scheme). However, [4] and [5] demonstrate equally accurate results on fully unstructured grids, suggesting that their technologies are capable of meeting the objectives of this scope. An additional shortcoming of current research is that all efforts examine the same 5 km/s flight condition (relatively slow for planetary entry) with simplistic, nonionized flow models. An infusion of resources is needed to mature these promising algorithms into scalable, production-ready software that can be tested across a full entry trajectory with best-practice thermochemical models.","This scope is directly relevant to NASA space missions in both Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) and Science Mission Directorate (SMD) with an EDL segment. These missions depend on aerothermal CFD to define critical flight environments and would see significant, sustained reductions in cost and time-to-first-solution if an effective unstructured simulation capability is deployed. This scope also has strong crosscutting benefits for tools used by ARMD to simulate airbreathing hypersonic vehicles, which have stringent accuracy requirements similar to those in aerothermodynamics. Finally, this scope aligns with NASA’s CFD Vision 2030 Study, which calls for a “much higher degree of automation in all steps of the analysis process” with the ultimate goal of making “mesh generation and adaptation less burdensome and, ultimately, invisible to the CFD process.” In order for the aerothermal community to realize these goals, we must eliminate our dependence on manually designed, carefully tailored, block structured grids. This scope is an enabling technology for that transition.","

Suggested challenge problems are prescribed motion of a cylinder relative to the computation domain subject to Mach 6+ supersonic flow or 2D axisymmetric simulation of a shock tube with an initial pressure ratio >50.

The software shall demonstrate a 10x speedup relative to a nonadaptive, time-marched calculation without significantly degrading simulation accuracy as measured by an appropriate solution metric (average reflectance measurement system (RMS) pressure fluctuation, final capsule pitch angle, etc.).","Multiple academic, government, and commercial software packages exist that implement some form of solution-adaptive mesh refinement. NASA’s LAURA and DPLR codes offer simplistic clustering algorithms for structured grids that solve the limited problem of resolving strong bow shocks [7][8]. NASA’s FUN3D code implements an advanced metric-based, anisotropic refinement capability that has been demonstrated on large-scale aerospace calculations [7]. However, unsteady solution-adaptive algorithms have yet to be demonstrated for EDL-relevant problems outside of academic research codes. Significant investment is required to implement these algorithms into a production-quality flow solver with the performance and scaling characteristics required to address NASA’s requirements for unsteady flow simulation.","This scope has extremely broad applicability across multiple NASA mission directorates. In particular, ARMD, HEOMD, SMD, and STMD each contend with complex, unsteady flow phenomena that could be more readily analyzed with the aid of the proposed technology: flutter analysis, parachute inflation, fluid slosh, and atmospheric modeling are just a few examples. In EDL specifically, a robust time-space adaption capability would enable simulation of supersonic retropropulsion at Mars using NASA’s existing supercomputing assets. Capsule stability could be analyzed in the preliminary design phase, allowing mission designers to utilize low-heritage capsule shapes without adding significant cost or risk to the project. Drag skirt separation could be modeled in detail to reduce risk prior to a technology demonstration mission. The potential benefits of this technology are widespread, making this a critical investment area for the Agency.","

Fiber-optic systems are also immune to electromagnetic interference (EMI), which reduces design and qualification efforts. This would be highly beneficial to future planetary missions requiring thermal protection systems (TPSs). In addition, as NASA looks to the future of science missions to the outer planets, extreme entry environments will require the new, 3D-woven Heatshield for Extreme Entry Environment Technology (HEEET) TPS recently matured within the Agency. Gathering flight performance data on this new material will be key—particularly the measurement of recession, which was so very important on the Galileo probe mission to Jupiter. Minimizing the sensor intrusion of the outer mold line is critical in this case because the extreme environment dictates that the TPS be as aerothermally monolithic as possible. In applications to planetary entry vehicles greater than about 1 m in diameter, however, the HEEET TPS is expected to contain seams that might be used for accommodating instrumentation.Recession measurements in carbon fiber/phenolic TPSs such as Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) and AVCOAT are also of interest. When ablation is not severe and/or rapid, accurate measurements have proven difficult with the historic Galileo-type sensor, which was based on the differential resistance resulting from sensor materials that have charred.To be considered against NASA state-of-the-art TPS sensing systems for future flight missions, fiber-optic systems must be competitive in sensing capability (measurement type, accuracy, and quantity) and associated data acquisition system mass, size, power, and cost. Therefore, NASA is looking for a fiber-optic system that can meet the following requirements:TPS Temperature Measurement Range: -200 to 1,250 ºC (up to 2,000 ºC is preferred). Accuracy: +/-5 ºC desired. Surface Pressure Measurement Range: 0 to 15 psi. Accuracy: < +/-0.5%.Destinations such as Mars, Venus, and Titan pose many challenges for EDL data acquisition systems, including radiation, g-loading, and volume constraints. Recent notable examples of such systems are the Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing Instrument (MEDLI) sensor suite, which successfully acquired EDL data in 2012, and the upcoming MEDLI2 system, which will gather data during EDL at Mars in February of 2021. The NASA MEDLI and MEDLI2 data systems are very well designed and robust to the extreme environments of space transit and EDL, but this comes at a great financial burden to these missions. The high cost prohibits smaller mission classes such as Discovery and New Frontiers from using MEDLI-like systems, therefore limiting the EDL science that can be conducted by NASA. In an effort to bring EDL instrumentation to all missions, NASA is seeking a low-cost, robust, high-accuracy data acquisition system that can meet the following requirements:Performs instrument signal conditioning and analog-to-digital conversion, and includes a spacecraft bus serial interface.

Improved understanding of entry environments and TPS performance could lead to reduced design margins, enabling a greater payload mass-fraction and smaller landing ellipses. Improved real-time measurement knowledge during entry could also minimize the landing dispersions for placing advanced payloads onto the surface of atmospheric and airless bodies.NASA science missions are frequently proposed that include high-speed Earth return (New Frontiers, Discovery, and Mars Sample Return) and Venus and Mars entry. Capsules used for these missions must withstand both convective and radiative aeroheating, and NASA now requires EDL instrumentation for these missions. Current radiative measurement techniques (radiometers) provide only an integrated heating over a limited wavelength range; past interpretation of such flight data [Ref. 3, 4] shows the need for spectrally resolved measurements from spectrometers. For Earth and Venus, the radiative component may be the dominant source of heating, and emission comes from the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV), which NASA currently has no capability to measure. For Mars and Venus, the aftbody radiation is dominated by midwave infrared (MWIR). Again, NASA does not have a method to measure MWIR radiation in flight; the current radiometers integrate across several band systems. Miniaturized spectrometers that can measure in VUV and MWIR would have immediate application to Science Mission Directorate (SMD) planetary missions. Such spectrometers may also inform what ablation species are emitted from the heat shield and backshell during entry.","

Fiber-optic systems are also immune to electromagnetic interference (EMI), which reduces design and qualification efforts. This would be highly beneficial to future planetary missions requiring thermal protection systems (TPSs). In addition, as NASA looks to the future of science missions to the outer planets, extreme entry environments will require the new, 3D-woven Heatshield for Extreme Entry Environment Technology (HEEET) TPS recently matured within the Agency. Gathering flight performance data on this new material will be key—particularly the measurement of recession, which was so very important on the Galileo probe mission to Jupiter. Minimizing the sensor intrusion of the outer mold line is critical in this case because the extreme environment dictates that the TPS be as aerothermally monolithic as possible. In applications to planetary entry vehicles greater than about 1 m in diameter, however, the HEEET TPS is expected to contain seams that might be used for accommodating instrumentation.Recession measurements in carbon fiber/phenolic TPSs such as Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) and AVCOAT are also of interest.

"Focus Area 12 Entry, Descent, and Landing Systems",Z7.03 Entry and Descent System Technologies, LaRC, ARC, 2021,Entry and Descent System Technologies,"Background: NASA is advancing deployable aerodynamic decelerators to enhance and enable robotic and human space missions. Applications include Mars, Venus, and Titan, as well as payload return to Earth from low Earth orbit. The benefit of deployable decelerators is that the entry vehicle structure and thermal protection system are not constrained by the launch vehicle shroud. They have the flexibility to more efficiently use the available shroud volume and can be packed into a much smaller volume for Earth departure, addressing potential constraints for payloads sharing a launch vehicle. For Mars, this technology also enables delivery of very large (20 metric tons or more) usable payload, which will likely be needed to support human exploration. The technology also allows for reduced cost access to space by enabling the recovery of launch vehicle assets. This subtopic area solicits innovative technology solutions applicable to deployable entry concepts. Specific technology development areas include:Advancements in textile manufacturing technologies that can be used to simplify production, reduce the mass, or reduce the stowed volume of mechanically deployed structures, inflatable structures, or their flexible thermal protection system. Thermal protection concepts can also lead to improvements in thermal management efficiency of radiant and conductive heat transport at elevated temperatures (exceeding 1,200 °C). Concepts can be either passive or active dissipation approaches. For smaller scale inflatable systems for small-spacecraft/satellite applications, less than 5 m in diameter, thin-ply or thin-film manufacturing approaches that can be used to reduce the minimum design gauge are of particular interest for inflatable structures. High-temperature-capable structural elements to support mechanically deployable decelerators that surpass the performance capability of metallic ribs, joints, and struts. Anticipated systems would include composite elements or hybrid approaches that combine metallic structures with high-temperature-capable interface materials to improve thermal performance. Minimum-mass approaches that address volumetric/packing efficiencies at small-scale (approx. 1 to 2 m) implementations are of interest for small-satellite applications. Development of gas-generator technologies used as inflation systems that result in improved mass efficiency and system complexity over both current pressurized cold gas systems and present state-of-the-art gas generators for inflatable structures. Inflation gas technologies can include warm or hot gas generators, sublimating powder systems, or hybrid systems; however, the final delivery gas temperature must not exceed 200 °C. Lightweight, high-efficiency gas inflation technologies capable of delivering gas at 250 to 10,000 standard liters per minute (SLPM) are sought. This range spans a number of potential applications. Thus, a given response need not address the entire range. Additionally, the final delivery gas and its byproducts must not harm aeroshell materials, such as the fluoropolymer liner of the inflatable structure. Minimal solid particulate is acceptable as a final byproduct. Water vapor as a final byproduct is also acceptable for lower flow (250 to 4,000 SLPM) and shorter duration missions, but it is undesirable for higher flow (8,000 to 10,000 SLPM) and longer duration missions. Chillers and/or filters can be included in a proposed solution, but they will be included in assessing the overall system mass versus amount of gas generated.",1 to 4,"Level 1: TX 09 Entry, Descent, and Landing

Developing more efficient, lighter, and thinner flexible thermal protection system component materials with higher temperature capability could potentially enable more efficient designs and extend the maximum range of use of the concepts. Novel and innovative high-temperature structural concepts are needed for the mechanically deployed decelerator. Development of gas generator technologies that improve mass efficiency over current pressurized cold gas systems for inflatable structures is needed.","NASA needs advanced deployable aerodynamic decelerators to enhance and enable robotic and human space missions.

Furthermore, although the physics of the atmosphere and the characteristics of the regolith are different for the Moon, the capability to model PSIs on the Moon will feed forward to Mars, where it is critical for human exploration.Currently, flight data are collected from early planetary landing, and those data are fed into developmental tools for validation purposes. The validation dataset, as well as the expertise, grows as a result of each mission and is shared across and applied to all other missions. We gain an understanding of how various parameters, including different types of surfaces, lead to different cratering effects and plume behaviors. The information helps NASA and industry make lander design and operations decisions. Ground testing (“unit tests”) is used early in the development of the capability in order to provide data for tool validation.The current post-landing analysis of planetary landers (on Mars) is performed in a cursory manner with only partially empirically-validated tools, because there has been no dedicated fundamental research investment in this area.

Future exploration missions will utilize new ablative TPS materials that release decomposition products into the gas stream ahead of the vehicle, influencing flow-field behavior. Data and observations from materials testing programs using NASA’s arc jet facilities are critical for validation of high-fidelity modeling and simulation tools used to design and margin TPS specifications for entry vehicles. However, the complex multiphysics processes that manifest as entry aeroheating of ablative TPSs present formidable challenges for model validation. The available diagnostic techniques for arc jet testing provide little direct evidence of the subject aerothermal and thermophysical processes.NASA is seeking advanced and new optical and laser-spectroscopic techniques applied to arc jet testing programs. Experimental methods for arc jet facility characterization strive to quantify thermodynamic and gas dynamic properties of the arc jet stream and serve multiple purposes, such as verification of test conditions (facility operations), validation of arc heater and flow-field simulations, and measurement of incident/boundary conditions for material response simulations. Of equal importance are methods that can detect and identify pyrolysis gases and particles injected into the shocked gas region ahead of TPS material test articles, providing needed insight to the complex interactions of the flow field with material response. Experimental methods that measure recession, temperature, and optical properties of the TPS surface enable characterization of surface thermal response phenomenology.The off-body gas phase diagnostics are to detect and quantify:Major species in the arc jet stream (N, O, N2, NO for air; CO and CO2 for facilities capable of operating with CO2 mixtures). Ablation species and recombination products in the shock layer (C, CN, CH, H, Ca). Spalled particles from test articles penetrating the shock layer.Also of importance are measurements of velocity and free stream and shock layer temperatures, including vibrational temperature. Planar or line imaging techniques are desired to characterize spatial distributions with 1-mm or smaller resolution at kHz data rates. Burst mode (>100 kHz) imaging approaches that enable correlation of temporal-spatial intermittencies are of particular interest.The requested surface imaging diagnostics are to measure test-article temperature and spectral emissivity, topology, and recession rate. Hyperspectral techniques are preferred if they enable characterization of multiple surface properties simultaneously while discriminating from shock layer radiation. Spatial resolutions and acquisition rates of <1 mm and >30 Hz, respectively, are desired. Adaptation of standoff surface spectroscopy techniques may hold promise for time-resolved species detection and identification.Spallation characterization requires measurements of ejected particle size distributions, 2D and 3D trajectories, and velocity distributions. Techniques for both stagnation and shear testing configurations are desired. Imaging spatial resolution and field of view needs to account for particle trajectories that travel upstream and penetrate shock waves. Methods that provide insight to the chemical composition of spalled particles would be particularly valuable. Anticipated particle size and speeds are 1 to 100 µm and 1 to 200 m/s, respectively.",3 to 6,"Level 1: TX 09 Entry, Descent, and Landing

Hardware",Phase I: Assessment study of potential diagnostic techniques. Phase II: Prototype instrument demonstration in relevant environment with hardware delivery to NASA.,"The requirements for spatially resolved, species-specific measurements of high-temperature-reacting gas properties necessitate the use of optical-spectroscopic methods. The state of the art at NASA’s arc-heated facilities are techniques based on nanosecond-pulsed laser-induced fluorescence (ns-LIF). Pointwise flow property measurement requires approximately 60 to 90 sec per acquisition to recover properties calibrated to engineering units (velocity, temperature, species densities) at one location. The low sensitivity and long standoff distances in arc-heated facilities preclude line or planar imaging. The long acquisition times result in a poor use of expensive testing resources. The ns-LIF approach is not suitable for post-shock and near-surface regions, as the moderate pressures, high temperatures, and strong gas and surface luminosity confound signal interpretation, effectively prohibiting quantitative ablation species detection. Emission spectroscopy techniques for free-stream and shock-layer measurements have been used with success for many years, but these are limited to observation of excited-state populations along integrated lines of sight. Tunable laser absorption spectroscopy can target ground-state or excited-state populations of certain species of interest; however, the low-density/high-temperature test conditions and the short path lengths yield absorbances too low for detection with demonstrated laser absorption techniques.Recent advances in tunable amplified sources pumped by kHz and burst-mode femtosecond-pulse lasers has enabled the development of several nonlinear laser spectroscopy techniques. These new techniques have capabilities that directly address the sensitivity, temporal, and spatial resolution shortcomings identified above.For spallation diagnostics, both active interrogation/response and passive imaging techniques have potential for characterizing size distributions, trajectories, and velocity distributions. NASA’s current capability for observing and quantifying spallation is the use of high-speed gated video, which is limited to situations where particle luminosity can be distinguished from background sources.","Several potential future missions, outlined in decadal surveys, crewed exploration mission studies, and other supporting analyses, have ED/EDL (entry and descent or entry, descent, and landing) architectures: Mars Sample Return, high-speed crewed return, high-mass Mars landers, Venus, and gas/ice giant probes. With few exceptions, entry vehicle TPS for these missions will be composed of materials currently under development and without certification heritage in multiple gases. Arc jet testing at conditions relevant for certification will invariably be required for each of these proposed missions. Ground testing at more extreme environments for future missions will challenge existing capabilities. There is a compelling need now to bring research-level diagnostic technologies forward to ensure that facility operations can confidently demonstrate required performance to TPS technology projects.Conventional instrumentation will continue to be the primary source of facility characterization data. The purposes of the advanced techniques are to provide validating evidence for the conventional instrumentation, reveal error and bias in interpretation of heat flux measurements, and ultimately reduce uncertainty in facility performance data provided to test programs.NASA planetary exploration programs supporting ED/EDL missions are the intended beneficiaries of this subtopic. The first-line project is the Space Technology Mission Directorate's Entry Systems Modeling Project.","

"Focus Area 12 Entry, Descent, and Landing Systems","Z7.06Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) Terrestrial Testing Technologies", ARC, LaRC, 2021,Advanced Instrumentation for NASA's Shock Tube and Ballistic Range Facilities,"Arc-heated high-enthalpy test facilities at NASA’s Ames and Langley Research Centers are used for evaluation and certification of high-temperature materials and structures of an entry vehicle’s thermal protection system (TPS). Future exploration missions will utilize new ablative TPS materials that release decomposition products into the gas stream ahead of the vehicle, influencing flow-field behavior. Data and observations from materials testing programs using NASA’s arc jet facilities are critical for validation of high-fidelity modeling and simulation tools used to design and margin TPS specifications for entry vehicles. However, the complex multiphysics processes that manifest as entry aeroheating of ablative TPSs present formidable challenges for model validation. The available diagnostic techniques for arc jet testing provide little direct evidence of the subject aerothermal and thermophysical processes.NASA is seeking advanced and new optical and laser-spectroscopic techniques applied to arc jet testing programs. Experimental methods for arc jet facility characterization strive to quantify thermodynamic and gas dynamic properties of the arc jet stream and serve multiple purposes, such as verification of test conditions (facility operations), validation of arc heater and flow-field simulations, and measurement of incident/boundary conditions for material response simulations. Of equal importance are methods that can detect and identify pyrolysis gases and particles injected into the shocked gas region ahead of TPS material test articles, providing needed insight to the complex interactions of the flow field with material response. Experimental methods that measure recession, temperature, and optical properties of the TPS surface enable characterization of surface thermal response phenomenology.The off-body gas phase diagnostics are to detect and quantify:Major species in the arc jet stream (N, O, N2, NO for air; CO and CO2 for facilities capable of operating with CO2 mixtures). Ablation species and recombination products in the shock layer (C, CN, CH, H, Ca). Spalled particles from test articles penetrating the shock layer.Also of importance are measurements of velocity and free stream and shock layer temperatures, including vibrational temperature. Planar or line imaging techniques are desired to characterize spatial distributions with 1-mm or smaller resolution at kHz data rates. Burst mode (>100 kHz) imaging approaches that enable correlation of temporal-spatial intermittencies are of particular interest.The requested surface imaging diagnostics are to measure test-article temperature and spectral emissivity, topology, and recession rate. Hyperspectral techniques are preferred if they enable characterization of multiple surface properties simultaneously while discriminating from shock layer radiation. Spatial resolutions and acquisition rates of <1 mm and >30 Hz, respectively, are desired. Adaptation of standoff surface spectroscopy techniques may hold promise for time-resolved species detection and identification.Spallation characterization requires measurements of ejected particle size distributions, 2D and 3D trajectories, and velocity distributions. Techniques for both stagnation and shear testing configurations are desired. Imaging spatial resolution and field of view needs to account for particle trajectories that travel upstream and penetrate shock waves. Methods that provide insight to the chemical composition of spalled particles would be particularly valuable. Anticipated particle size and speeds are 1 to 100 µm and 1 to 200 m/s, respectively.",3 to 6,"Level 1: TX 09 Entry, Descent, and Landing

Hardware",Phase I: Assessment study of potential diagnostic techniques or technology upgrades. Phase II: Prototype instrument demonstration in relevant environment (preferably with hardware delivery to NASA).,"The EAST facility’s instrumentation acquires data for shocked gas phenomenology and facility performance characterization. Measurements of radiance, absorbance, electron density, and temperature are used for validation of comprehensive radiation transport simulations of planetary atmospheres. Those measurements are primarily acquired using calibrated optical-spectroscopic instruments with sufficient temporal and/or spatial resolution to correlate observed magnitudes with localized, spectrally resolved absolute radiant fluxes or columnar property densities (including electron densities). Ancillary instrumentation is used to measure shock arrival times and transient pressures at the tube wall to establish shock speeds adjacent to the science instruments.Measurement techniques that correlate observables to atomic and molecular state populations and radiance magnitudes enable validation of radiance models. Emission spectroscopy techniques, which capture the transient characteristics of excited atomic and molecular state populations, have reached a high degree of maturity and performance.However, post-shock electron and ground-state or other dark-state population dynamics also influence shock radiance. Measurement of these states rely on more complicated absorption, induced fluorescence, or scattering (spontaneous and coherent) techniques. The lack of light sources and/or detectors with suitable spectral and temporal characteristics, or the challenges of implementation in impulse facilities, have limited the opportunities for such measurements. Techniques that enable measurement of these states would greatly expand opportunities for radiation transport model validation, particularly for conditions in which self-absorption would influence emission spectroscopy measurements. Specific quantities of interest are rotational/translation and vibrational temperatures, electron temperatures, and ground-state population densities of N2, N2+, N, O, CO, CN, H2, H.Spatiotemporal resolution is necessary to discern nonequilibrium relaxation processes behind a traveling shock wave and is the key requirement for EAST diagnostics. Field imaging at a single instant in time, or time-resolved imaging of a single point in space, must have resolutions equivalent to >1 mm and >1 µs to capture these relaxation processes.For the HFFAF, shadowgraph and schlieren photography are used to provide time-resolved imagery for aerodynamic force and moment analyses of scaled flight vehicles in free flight. A high-speed shutter (40-ns duration) and a spark-gap light source enable images to be captured without motion blur or image fogging from shocked gas radiance enveloping a test model. The shuttering system relies on Kerr cells filled with benzonitrile and a 35 kV pulse-shaping and switching network. Advances are sought for the eventual replacement of the 32 heritage light source/shutter systems with components that offer equal or greater performance as well as improved safety and reliability.","Several potential future missions outlined in decadal surveys, crewed exploration mission studies, and other supporting analyses have ED/EDL (entry and descent or entry, descent, and landing) architectures: Mars sample return, high-speed crewed return, high-mass Mars landers, and Venus and gas/ice giant probes. Entry vehicles to these destinations will encounter radiative heating to varying degrees. Radiative heating of a vehicle’s backshell has been recognized as a significant concern, so ensuring a full range of diagnostic techniques for expanding flows has become a high priority for the EDL community.Characterizing the aerodynamic stability of emerging deployable drag devices for entry vehicles is also of high importance for future high-mass lander missions. The HFFAF will be a key ground-test facility for acquiring crucial free-flight aerodynamic data for study and simulation validation.NASA planetary exploration programs supporting ED/EDL missions are the intended beneficiaries of this subtopic. Technology development projects supporting these programs are potential beneficiaries of new instrumentation for the EAST and HFFAF.","

The goal of this subtopic is to increase the mission impact of NASA's investments in supercomputing systems and associated operations and services. Specific objectives are to:Decrease the barriers to entry for prospective supercomputing users. Minimize the supercomputer user's total time-to-solution (e.g., time to discover, understand, predict, or design). Increase the achievable scale and complexity of computational analysis, data ingest, and data communications. Reduce the cost of providing a given level of supercomputing performance for NASA applications. Enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of NASA's supercomputing operations and services.Expected outcomes are to improve the productivity of NASA's supercomputing users, broaden NASA's supercomputing user base, accelerate advancement of NASA science and engineering, and benefit the supercomputing community through dissemination of operational best practices. The approach of this subtopic is to seek novel software and hardware technologies that provide notable benefits to NASA's supercomputing users and facilities and to infuse these technologies into NASA supercomputing operations. Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, NASA's high-end computing (HEC) projects: the High End Computing Capability project at Ames and the Scientific Computing project at Goddard. To assure maximum relevance to NASA, funded SBIR contracts under this subtopic are engaged to interact with one or both HEC projects and with key HEC users where appropriate. During the project the lead PI is encouraged to interact with the technical monitor on NASA HEC needs. Projects that require access to NASA HEC resources must provide adequate justification, and proposers should realize that it takes significant amount of time to gain access to on-site resources due to security requirements, which could jeopardize Phase I deliverable timelines. In addition, these resources are heavily used and would be limited for use for SBIR projects.The technology areas of this subtopic are aligned with two objectives of the NSCI, the National Strategic Computing Initiative, announced by the White House in July 2015. These technologies that are amenable to quick, small efforts for advancement: (1) Technologies to accelerate delivery of a capable exascale computing system delivering approximately 100× the performance of current systems across a range of applications (NSCI Objective 1) and (2) Technologies to increase coherence between the technology base used for modeling and simulation and that used for data analytic computing (NSCI Objective 2).",5 to 7,"Level 1: TX 11 Software, Modeling, Simulation, and Information Processing

Focus Area 13 Information Technologies for Science Data,S5.03Accelerating NASA Science and Engineering through the Application of Artificial Intelligence, GSFC," ARC, JPL, LaRC", 2021,Accelerating NASA Science and Engineering Through the Application of Artificial Intelligence,"NASA researchers are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies across science and engineering to address questions that previously could not be studied, in order to open up new insights. From both the Government and commercial sectors the volume and variety of datasets is increasing at an exponential rate, making it more of a challenge to NASA science and engineering. This subtopic is looking for innovative proposals using AI/ML to address the following unique problems across NASA. Proposals MUST specify and be in alignment with existing and/or future NASA programs to address or extend a specific need.This subtopic has the following three critical areas: (1) AI/ML at the Extreme Edge, (2) Rapid Detection of Land Coverage Change, and (3) Rapid Identification of Events in High-Resolution Earth System Model Data. This goal is accomplished by more completely specifying smaller, better defined areas that rest squarely within Focus Area 13 (Information Technologies for Science Data). Proposals for fault management should be addressed in S5.05 Fault Management Technologies (Focus Area 3 Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration). Further, proposals for small spacecraft trajectory control should be addressed in Z3.02 Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) for Small Spacecraft Swarm Trajectory Control (Focus Area 11 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems), and proposals for autonomous systems should be addressed in the STTR Topic T4 Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration (subtopic - Integrated Data Uncertainty Management & Representation for Trusted Autonomy in Space).Proposals should address one of the following focus areas:AI/ML at the Extreme Edge With the increase in data rates for instruments, there is an increasing need to compute at the edge, often in constrained computing environments. NASA is interested in the application of AI/ML on spacecraft, rovers, within a constellation of SmallSats, or other remote sensing platforms where the latency and bandwidth between the remote platform and the ground station are not sufficient to adequately download all data. An example of this is the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission where a fraction (approximately 2%) of the data taken will be transferred back to Earth. How can training of models be done efficiently at the edge to detect anomalies, perform classifications, segmentation, or run other types of AI/ML models? Rapid Detection of Land Cover Change Remote-sensing data of the Earth (both from NASA and commercial sources) is also continuing to increase at dramatic rates, and NASA is interested in using AI/ML to enable the rapid detection of changes in the land use and anomalies across multiple data sets. This will require the potential fusion of multiple satellite datasets, intersensor calibration, geolocation, and more. Rapid Identification of Events in High-Resolution Earth System Model Data The Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) uses a general circulation model (GCM) called the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) high-performance application to produce model output for instrument design. These nature runs are free-running atmospheric models that are driven by sea surface temperatures with resulting datasets being very large (on the order of petabytes). Instrument teams then use the GEOS output to study the potential impact of additional observations on specific weather phenomena such as hurricanes, weather fronts, mesoscale convective cells, and more. NASA is interested in models that can be trained to rapidly identify these various weather phenomena in the GEOS nature run data. This will be used to create a searchable catalogue of these events for use in observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs).Research proposed to this subtopic should demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I, and in partnership with scientists and/or engineers, show a path toward a Phase II prototype demonstration, with significant communication with missions and programs to later plan a potential Phase III infusion. It is highly desirable that the proposed projects lead to solutions that will be infused into NASA programs and projects.",4 to 6,"Level 1: TX 11 Software, Modeling, Simulation, and Information Processing

It is expected that the training sets, models, and resulting data products will be publicly accessible.In general, the desired outcomes for this subtopic include: (1) new or accelerated science and engineering products, (2) training data sets and trained models specifically for a given problem but that can also be used as a basis for furthering other science and engineering research and development, and (3) resulting data products that can be used and infused in NASA science projects and potentially used to develop new missions.More specifically,Phase I should be used to establish a proof of concept with deliverables including a final report, any software developed, training sets, etc. Phase II will expand on this proof of concept to a full prototype with a very similar set of deliverables, including a final report, software, training sets, etc.","NASA science and engineering is making large strides in the use of AI technologies (which includes both machine learning and deep learning). However, the datasets and requirements are growing so rapidly that additional support is needed to fill in gaps. In addition, emerging computational platforms now provide significant improvements in computing capabilities to enable AI to be applied to a wide variety of applications in science and engineering. These emerging computational capabilities have the potential to dramatically speed up AI calculations, and these systems are even being used as the reference architecture for exascale high-performance computing systems.","Broad applicability across throughout the decadal surveys and satellite development requirements.

Focus Area 13 Information Technologies for Science Data,S5.04Integrated Science Mission Modeling, JPL, GSFC, 2021,Innovative System Modeling Methods and Tools,"NASA seeks innovative systems modeling methods and tools addressing the following needs:Define, design, develop, and execute future science missions by developing and utilizing advanced methods and tools that empower more comprehensive, broader, and deeper system and subsystem modeling while enabling these models to be developed earlier in the lifecycle. Ideally, the proposed solutions should leverage MBSE (Model-Based Systems Engineering)/SysML (System Markup Language) approaches being piloted across NASA, allow for easier integration of disparate model types, and be compatible with current agile design processes. Enable disciplined system analysis for the design of future missions, including modeling of decision support for those missions and integrated models of technical and programmatic aspects of future missions. Evaluate technology alternatives and impacts, science valuation methods, and programmatic and/or architectural trades. Specific areas of interest are listed below. Proposers are encouraged to address more than one of these areas with an approach that emphasizes integration with others on the list: Conceptual phase models and tools that allow design teams to easily develop, populate, and visualize very broad, multidimensional trade spaces; methods for characterizing and selecting optimum candidates from those trade spaces, particularly at the architectural level. There is specific interest in models and tools that facilitate comprehensive comparison of architectural variants of systems. Capabilities for rapid-generation models of function or behavior of complex systems at either the system or the subsystem level. Such models should be capable of eliciting robust estimates of system performance given appropriate environments and activity timelines, and should be tailored: To support emerging usage of autonomy, both in mission operations and flight software as well as in growing usage of autocoding. To operate within highly distributed, collaborative design environments, where models and/or infrastructure that support/encourage designers are geographically separated (including Open Innovation environments). This includes considerations associated with near-real-time (concurrent) collaboration processes and associated model integration and configuration management practices.To be capable of execution at variable levels of fidelity/uncertainty. Ideally, models should have the ability to quickly adjust fidelity to match the requirements of the simulation (e.g., from broad-and-shallow to in-depth and back again). Target models (e.g., phenomenological or geophysical models) that represent planetary surfaces, interiors, atmospheres, etc., and associated tools and methods that allow for integration into system design/process models for simulation of instrument responses. These models may be algorithmic or numeric, but should be useful to designers wishing to optimize remote sensing systems for those planets. Note that this topic area addresses a broad potential range of science mission-oriented modeling tools and methods. This includes the integration of these tools into broader model-based engineering frameworks, and also includes proposals with MBSE/SysML as the primary focus.",3 to 5,"Level 1: TX 11 Software, Modeling, Simulation, and Information Processing

Research","Phase I should provide a final report that describes the methodology and proof of concept of adaptability of the model for NASA use.At the completion of Phase II, NASA desires a working prototype suitable for demonstrations with ""real"" data to make a compelling case for NASA usage. Use and development of the model—including any and all work performed to verify and validate it—should be documented.","There currently are a variety of models, methods, and tools in use across the Agency and with our industry partners. These are often custom, phase-dependent, and poorly interfaced to other tools. The disparity between the creativity in the early phases and the detail-oriented focus in later phases has created phase transition boundaries, where missions not only change teams but tools and methods as well. We aim to improve this.As NASA continues its move into greater use of models for formulation and development of NASA projects and programs, there are recurring challenges to address. This subtopic focuses on encouraging solutions to these cross-cutting modeling challenges.These cross-cutting challenges include: greater modeling breadth (e.g., cost/schedule), depth (scalability), variable fidelity (precision/accuracy vs. computation time), trade space exploration (how to evaluate large numbers of options), and processes that link them together. The focus is not on specific tools, but demonstrations of capability and methodologies for achieving the above.The explosion of MBX (model-based everything) has led to a proliferation of models, modeling processes, and the integration/aggregation thereof. The model results are often combined with no clear understanding of the fidelity/credibility. While some NASA personnel are looking for greater accuracy and ""single source of truth,"" others are looking for the generation and exploration of massive trade spaces. Both greater precision and greater robustness will require addressing the cross-cutting challenges cited above.","Several concept/feasibility studies for potential large (flagship) Astrophysics missions are in progress: Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor (LUVOIR), Origins Space Telescope (OST), Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx), and Lynx. Following the 2020 Astrophysics decadal rankings, one of these will likely proceed to early Phase A, where the infusion of new and advanced systems modeling tools and methods would be a potential game-changer in terms of rapidly navigating architecture trades, requirements development and flow-down, and design optimization.A variety of planetary missions requires significant modeling and simulation across a variety of possible trade spaces. The portions of this topic area focused on breadth and variable fidelity will support them.","

Focus Area 13 Information Technologies for Science Data,S5.06Space Weather Research-to-Operations/Operations-to-Research (R2O/O2R) Technology Development, GSFC," ARC, JPL, JSC, LaRC, MSFC", 2021,Space Weather Research-to-Operations/Operations-to-Research (R2O/O2R) Technology Development,"Space weather has the potential to disrupt telecommunications; aircraft and satellite systems; electric power subsystems; and position, navigation, and timing services. Given the importance of these systems to our national well-being, NASA’s Heliophysics Division invests in activities to improve the understanding of these phenomena and to enable new monitoring, prediction, and mitigation strategies. The national direction for this work is organized by the Space Weather Operations, Research, and Mitigation (SWORM) Working Group, which is a Federal interagency coordinating body organized under the Space Weather, Security, and Hazards (SWSH) Subcommittee. The SWSH is a part of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Committee on Homeland and National Security, organized under the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). The SWORM coordinates Federal Government departments and agencies to meet the goals and objectives specified in the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan released in March 2019. NASA’s role under the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan is to provide increased understanding of the fundamental physics of the Sun-Earth system through space-based observations and modeling, the development of new space-based space weather technologies and missions, and monitoring of space weather for NASA's space missions. This includes research that advances operational space weather needs. This subtopic solicits new, enabling space weather technologies as part of NASA’s response to these national objectives. While this subtopic will consider all concepts demonstrably related to NASA’s R2O/O2R responsibilities outlined in the Strategy and Action Plan, four areas have been identified for priority development:Space Weather Forecasting Technologies and Techniques: Innovative technologies and techniques are solicited that explore and enable the transition of tools, models, data, and knowledge from research to operational environments. This includes the preparation and validation of existing science models that may be suitable for transition to operational use. Consultation with existing NASA capabilities that prepare space weather forecasting products for later use—such as the Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG) at Johnson Space Center (JSC), the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), and the Short-term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) Center at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC)—may be appropriate. Areas of special interest include, but are not limited to:Lunar space environment characterization tools that can be employed by NASA to enhance protection of crewed and uncrewed missions to cis-lunar and lunar surface missions. Specifications and/or forecasts of the energetic particle and plasma conditions encountered by spacecraft within Earth’s magnetosphere, as well as products that directly aid in spacecraft anomaly resolution; and end-users such as spacecraft operators. Approaches that potentially lead to a 2- to 3-day forecasting of atmospheric drag effects on satellites and improvement in the quantification of orbital uncertainties in low-Earth-orbit (LEO) altitude ranges (up to ~2000 km). Techniques that enable the characterization and prediction of ionospheric variability that induces scintillations, which impact communication and global navigation and positioning systems. Longer range (2 to 3 days) forecasting of SPEs (solar particle events) and an improved all-clear SPE-forecasting capability.Space Weather Advanced Data-Driven Discovery Techniques: A particular challenge is to combine the sparse, vastly distributed data sources available with realistic models of the near-Earth space environment. Data assimilation and other cutting-edge data- driven discovery innovations are solicited that enable tools and protocols for the operational space weather community. Priority will be given to proposals that: Develop data assimilation space weather applications or technologies desired by established space weather operational organizations. Integrate data from assets that typically do not share similar time series, utilize different measurement techniques (e.g., imaging vs. in situ particles and fields), or are distributed throughout the heliosphere. Provide new data-driven operational forecasting tools that can be straightforwardly validated by the CCMC or another equally robust validation methodology. Integrate underutilized resources (e.g., space-based radio occultation for ionospheric specification or U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) ground conductivity measurements related to geomagnetically induced currents). Space Weather Mitigation Technologies: The 2019 National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan specifically calls out the need to test, evaluate, and deploy technologies and devices to mitigate the effects of space weather on communication systems, geomagnetic disturbances on the electrical power grid, or radiation events on satellites. Additionally, it identifies a need for robust situational awareness capabilities, driven by improved understanding and characterization of the effects space weather phenomena have on Earth and in the space environment, to inform decision making and enable the execution of missions susceptible to disruptions from space weather. It also includes the development of processes to improve the transition of research approaches to operations.Space Weather Instrumentation: Heliophysics science relies on a wide variety of instrumentation for its research and often makes its data available in near real time for space weather forecasting purposes. Concepts are solicited for instrumentation concepts, flight architectures, and reporting systems that enable enhanced, more informative, robust, and effective measurements for space weather monitoring and forecasting systems. Opportunities for improving measurements include increased spatial and temporal resolution, fidelity, promptness, and measurement system reliability. This includes the miniaturization of existing systems and/or technologies deployable as an array of CubeSats, as a hosted payload on satellite or other platform, or as a small complete mission making use of a rideshare opportunity.In order to be considered for investment, SBIR technologies should demonstrate comparable, or better, precision and accuracy when compared to the current state of the art. Further, SBIR instrument designs should avoid duplicating current NASA research spacecraft arrays or detector systems, including those currently in formulation or development (e.g., Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP), Geospace Dynamics Constellation (GDC), Medici, Explorer concepts, etc.).Proposals must demonstrate an understanding of the current state of the art, describe how the proposed innovation is superior, and provide a feasible plan to develop the technology and infuse it into a specific activity listed within the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan.",3 to 8,"Level 1: TX 11 Software, Modeling, Simulation, and Information Processing

Software","Space weather is a broad umbrella encompassing science, engineering, applications, and operations. The ultimate goal of this SBIR subtopic is to generate products or services (“deliverables”) that enable end-user action. The deliverables can be applied, for example, to space weather hazard assessments, to real-time situational awareness, or to plan protective mitigation actions. Deliverables can be in the form of new data, new techniques, new instrumentation, and/or predictive models that are prepared/validated for transition into operations.Phase I deliverables are proof-of-concept data and/or detailed technique, instrument, or model development plans with sufficient fidelity to assess technical, management, cost, and schedule risk.Phase I deliverables should also delineate the scope and benefit of the proposed products that could be realized as a result of Phase II and what further scope and benefit necessarily requires further development after Phase II. Phase II deliverables are functioning prototype versions of the proposed technologies that have been tested in a realistic environment or within a standard space weather community development and validation framework. The extent of the prototype development and testing will vary with the technology and will be evaluated as part of the Phase II proposal.Phase II deliverables should also include delineate any further work that would be required to bring the technologies to full operational and commercial use.","We do not yet know how to predict what needs to be predicted, we do not yet know how quantitatively good/bad our operational capabilities are (metrics), mechanisms do not yet exist to enable a broad range of the community to participate in the improvement of operational models, and the research environment advances understanding rather than the improvement of operational products.Space weather poses a constant threat to the Nation’s critical infrastructure, our satellites in orbit, and our crewed and uncrewed space activities. Extreme space weather events can cause substantial harm to our Nation’s security and economic vitality.Preparing for space weather events is an important aspect of American resilience that bolsters national and homeland security and facilitates continued U.S. leadership in space. A robust space weather program and its associated forecasting capabilities are essential for NASA’s future exploration success.","This SBIR subtopic enables NASA to demonstrate progress against NASA Goal 1.4: Understand the Sun and its interactions with Earth and the solar system, including space weather.These applied research projects directly address NASA's role within the SWORM Working Group, which is a Federal interagency coordinating body organized under the SWSH Subcommittee. The SWSH is a part of the NSTC Committee on Homeland and National Security, organized under the OSTP. The SWORM coordinates Federal Government departments and agencies to meet the goals and objectives specified in the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan released in March 2019.The Heliophysics Space Weather Science and Applications (SWxSA) Program establishes an expanded role for NASA in space weather science under a single element. It is consistent with the recommendation of the National Research Council (NRC) Decadal Survey and the OSTP/SWORM 2019 National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan. It competes ideas and products, leverages existing agency capabilities, collaborates with other agencies, and fosters partnership with user communities. The SWxSA program is distinguishable from other heliophysics research elements in that it is specifically focused on investigations that significantly advance understanding of space weather and then apply this progress to enable more accurate characterization and predictions with longer lead time. The Heliophysics Living with a Star (LWS) Program has established a path forward to meet NASA’s obligations to the research relevant to space weather and is a significant source of input to SWxSA.Further involvement by the emerging Heliophysics space weather commercial community has the potential to significantly advance the space weather application obligations portion of the mandate.Astronauts are not protected by the Earth's atmosphere and are exposed to space radiation such as galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles. A robust space weather program and associated forecasting capabilities is essential for NASA's future exploration success.","

"Focus Area 14 On-orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (OSAM)",T12.06Extensible Modeling of Additive Manufacturing Processes, JPL,, 2021,Process Modeling of Additive Manufacturing,"The subtopic of modeling of additive processes is highly relevant to NASA as the Agency is currently on a path to implement additive processes in spaceflight systems with little or no ability to model the process and thereby predict the results. In order to reliably use this process with a variety of materials for spaceflight applications, NASA has to have a much deeper understanding of the process. NASA is currently considering these processes for the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE), Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals (SHERLOC), ion engines, and other spacecraft structural and multifunctional applications. Additive manufacturing of development and flight hardware with metallic alloys is being developed by NASA and its various partners for a variety of spacecraft applications. These components are expected to see extreme environments coupled with a need for high-reliability (e.g., manned spaceflight), which requires a deeper understanding of the manufacturing processes. Modeling of the additive processes to provide accurate dimensional designs, preferred microstructures that are defect free is a significant challenge that would dramatically benefit from a joint academic-industry approach. The objective would be to create process models that are compatible with current alloys systems and additive manufacturing equipment, which will provide accurate prediction of outcomes from a variety of additive manufacturing process parameters and materials combinations. The primary alloys of interest to NASA at this time include: Inconel 625 and 718, stainless steels, such as 304 and 316, Al10SiMg, Ti-6Al-4V, and copper alloys (GrCop-84). It is desired that the modeling approach address a focused material system, but be readily adaptable to eventually accommodate all of these materials. Therefore, the model should incorporate modest parameter changes coupled with being easily extensible for future alloys of interest to NASA. NASA is interested in modeling of the Selective Laser Melting (SLM), Electron Beam Melting (EBM), and Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) processes.",1 to 2,"Level 1: TX 12 Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems, and Manufacturing

The deliverables can be either stand-alone software or modules for existing, commercially available software. The Phase I deliverable should be preliminary modeling results, an accurate description of the software with revision tracking, and an architecture plan demonstrating the output data (if stand-alone software) or modularity (if the software connects to commercially existing products). The Phase II deliverable should be a copy of the software, along with modeling results, as well as a final report stating relevant data, such as boundary conditions, assumptions, process simplifications used for quicker computing, etc. The output data should be in a clearly defined format with a clear description and discussion of how it can be imported into other modeling tools used for additive manufacturing, to create a truly extensible framework. If the productis a module for existing software, then the final report should demonstrate functionality with that software (including computing elements required, version of the software, etc.) and that the results can feed into other aspects of the commercially available software.",Additive manufacturing will be used for spaceflight applications. NASA and its suppliers currently have very little knowledge of what is happening with these processes. Modeling of these additive processes is essential for NASA to be able to use these processes reliably. NASA is currently working on a specification for these processes and modeling would help that effort as well.,"Process modeling of additive manufacturing is relevant to Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD), Science Mission Directorate (SMD), and Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), all of which have extant efforts in additive manufacturing. HEOMD is focusing heavily on the use of additive manufacturing for propulsion systems (e.g., RS-25 and RL10) for SLS, SMD is using additive manufacturing on the Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry (PIXL) on the Mars 2020 mission, the Psyche Mission, as well as various ESI initiatives through STMD.","

Targeted applications for the technology include processing of spent components into feedstock for in-space manufacturing and/or processing of large-scale structures (such as spent upper stages) into material forms for further use. While the focus should be on material processing (which may include shredding, melting, solidifying, and other processes necessary to obtain a final feedstock form), other ancillary techniques such as sorting, purification, and material delivery/transport may also be considered as part of an overall concept of operations. How the system will be deployed and operated in either an IVA or EVA environment should also be considered. The Phase I effort should also include a laboratory demonstration of the core recycling technique with an aerospace-grade metallic material and some characterization of properties post-recycling. Relevant metrics such as power consumption, system footprint, and mass of system should also be reported, with an emphasis on scalability and adaptation to the relevant space environment. This work will collectively inform preliminary design of a metal recycling capability for in-space use. An additional constraint is that the system must be operated remotely with very little intervention/setup. Even in an IVA environment with crew, the availability of crew time to tend or service a recycling system will be very limited.

The capability to break down spent components and larger structures and repurpose them into a useful product is needed on long-duration space missions where logistics are constrained. Recycling of polymer materials on the International Space Station (ISS) into manufacturing feedstock (for 3D printing) has been previously demonstrated, but there are no current recycling capabilities for metals on the ISS. For external applications of metal recycling, NASA has funded some Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) work previously on repurposing of spent rocket stages left in-orbit. Recycling, reuse, and repurposing of metals is seen as a critical gap for on-orbit servicing, assembly, and manufacturing (OSAM) and shifting the logistics paradigm from pre-positioning of spare parts to point-of-use manufacturing.","The research requested through this solicitation is relevant to NASA programs, including (but not limited to) the following: ISS, Exploration Crew Module, Gateway, Lunar Base Camp, OSAM-1, OSAM-2 and in-Space Assembled Telescope (iSAT).","

"Focus Area 14 On-orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (OSAM)","Z3.04Autonomous Modular Assembly Technology for On-Orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (OSAM)", LaRC, MSFC, 2021,"Autonomous Modular Assembly Technology for On-Orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (OSAM)","As NASA seeks to extend its presence into deep space, ground-based human intelligence applied to supervision, control, and intervention of operations will no longer be viable due to system and mission complexity and communication delays. Therefore, trusted and certified-safe autonomous systems with machine intelligence and robotic capabilities of responding to both nominal and unexpected situations will be needed. These systems should be capable of:Sensing and perception. Acquiring measurements on-orbit or on planetary surfaces. Achieving situational awareness. Making decisions. Taking action. Teaming with humans and other machine agents. Using experiential data to update capabilities. Verifying autonomy algorithms and behavior. Validating as-assembled structure shape and interface integrity.As such, autonomy, system modularity, metrology, and modeling and simulation are four critical aspects required to enable OSAM. The hardware and software components of an in-space assembled structure must be modular to facilitate servicing, component replacement, and reconfiguration of the spacecraft. Assembly by autonomous robots can reduce the workload of astronauts and ground crew and can mitigate inefficiencies due to communication delays associated with teleoperation. The OSAM paradigm requires multiple autonomous agents to collaborate in a complex, dynamic environment. These agents will need to accurately perceive both their environment (the worksite) and each other in order to efficiently allocate tasks, plan trajectories, and respond to disturbances—all in the presence of uncertainties such as unknown payload characteristics and unmodeled effects. Modular structures will increase ease of access to space. Modular platforms could host flight hardware and share power, data, GN&C (guidance, navigation, and control), and thermal regulation capabilities. Under this paradigm, technology demonstrations could be performed without the need to design and operate an entire spacecraft. Modules could simply occupy space on an already existing platform. This constitutes a plug-and-play architecture that will require a common interface between modules such that required structural loads can be supported as well as power, data, and other services.Modeling and simulation of structures and assembly agents is necessary for verifying autonomous agent algorithms and behavior used for structures that cannot be assembled on the ground. Accurate sensing of complex and uncertain environments is necessary to provide autonomous agents with situational awareness to accomplish assembly tasks. Validation of the autonomous system behavior and in-space assembled structure accuracy in situ will require in-space metrology capabilities.The scope of this subtopic includes modular hardware and software systems:Element 1: Algorithms and software for sensing, planning, and control of both autonomous robots and mission/task management agents. Element 2: Novel hardware designs (modular robots and structures). Element 3: Hardware and software for global (worksite-scale) metrology systems for accurately sensing agent and structure pose within an on-orbit or lunar assembly worksite. Element 4: Novel approaches to dynamics-based mathematical modeling for complex rigid-body connections and independent verification and validation for dynamics-based rigid multi-body mathematical models.A solution for autonomous modular technologies for OSAM will be built on the following foundational areas:Heterogeneous multi-agent planning and control: Algorithms for collaboration on shared tasks for assembly of large modular space structures; task allocation among multiple agents; trajectory planning through the worksite and real-time updating of tasks and trajectories to respond to unplanned scenarios; robust and adaptive control for guaranteed performance or graceful degradation of performance for robotic manipulators and/or novel assembly agents; and teaming of humans and machines for planning, validation, and post-assembly analysis. Strategies and solutions for error detection and correction during the assembly process: Perception systems and/or classification algorithms independent from the assembly agent for verifying assembly steps and characterizing assembly errors. Fault/anomaly detection, diagnosis, and response to restore nominal operations or derive an acceptable alternative goal. Metrology systems: Global metrology systems or sensing tools that can map a worksite to facilitate agent and structure assembly path-planning for real-time task management and situational awareness and facilitate verification and validation of assembly tasks. A scalable system that can accurately measure structures at an in-space (orbital or surface) worksite with a focus on minimal supporting infrastructure is desired. Concepts with potential for integration and repurposing after construction are favored. Modular structures, systems, and tools: Deployables that are rigidizable by an accompanying in situ system (i.e., trusses or functional modules), can be serviced (due to modularity), are capable of moving along truss structures of variable geometries, and/or can interface with agents or be stored/stowed at a worksite where the agent mostly acts as a driver for a mobility system. Of particular interest are approaches to efficiently connect truss modules together—hardware concepts that support the interconnection of modules in the 100- to 5,000-kg range using some form of space robotics. The objective is to minimize the parasitic mass of the completed spacecraft from the modularity features that are required for intermodule assembly. Features can be added and removed to reduce this parasitic mass. Proposals are preferred that include features to connect both electrical (power and data) and structural features, noting that the connections can occur sequentially. Joining strategies that support fluid connections are of interest but are not necessary to be responsive to this subtopic area. The structural connection should occur at a minimum of three discrete locations, fixing the rigid-body motion of the two modules in all six degrees of freedom while isolating (minimizing) forces resulting from thermal-induced strain between the modules consistent with a low Earth orbit (LEO) orbit. The three (or more) connections do not have to occur simultaneously. Modeling and simulation: Novel approaches to dynamics-based mathematical modeling for complex rigid-body connections with nonlinear effects (for example, slider, ball, or slot connections) and independent verification and validation for dynamics-based rigid multibody mathematical models. Of particular interest are accurate dynamics-based models for joining of modules on-orbit or in planetary environments.",3 to 5,"Level 1: TX 10 Autonomous Systems

Software",Phases I and II should both result in the following deliverables:Software implementations of designed algorithms. Documentation verifying the efficacy of the designed algorithms. Physical prototypes of designed hardware. Design documentation for any designed hardware.Level of detail in the documentation should be commensurate with project phase.,"As humans venture into deeper space, communication latency will increase to the point that autonomous operations are crucial. Current technologies for autonomous robots are low Technology Readiness Level (TRL), application specific, and fragile with respect to environmental uncertainties. To enable OSAM, these technologies must be made more resilient. Many interesting ideas exist in academia but have yet to be made into a viable product.Existing interfaces for modular trusses are purely structural. A critical gap is the development of interfaces that can exchange power, data, and other services over the interface.","Achieving a robust and resilient autonomous solution for OSAM requires the intersection of many disciplines, including mechanical and electrical systems, robotics, dynamics modeling, control theory, and computer science. NASA goals that would directly benefit from this work are future lunar exploration missions, including sustained human presence on the Moon and persistent space platforms.","

"Focus Area 15 Materials, Materials Research, Structures, and Assembly",H5.01Lunar Surface Solar Array Structures, LaRC, GRC, 2021,Lunar Surface Solar Array Structures,"NASA intends to land near the lunar South Pole (between 85 and 90 S latitude) by 2024 in Phase I of the Artemis Program and then establish a sustainable long-term presence by 2028 in Phase II. At exactly the lunar South Pole (90 S), the Sun elevation angle varies between -1.5º and 1.5º during the year. At 85 S latitude, the elevation angle variation increases to between -6.5º and 6.5º. These persistently shallow Sun grazing angles result in the interior of many polar craters never receiving sunlight (and accumulating volatiles including water ice) while some nearby elevated ridges and plateaus receive sunlight up to 100% of the time in the summer and up to about 70% of the time in the winter. For this reason, these elevated sites are promising locations for human exploration and settlement because they avoid the excessively cold 354-hr nights found elsewhere on the Moon while providing nearly continuous sunlight for site illumination, moderate temperatures, and solar power [Refs. 1-2]. This subtopic seeks structural and mechanical innovations for 10 kW relocatable solar arrays near the South Pole for powering in situ resource utilization (ISRU) equipment, lunar bases, dedicated power landers and rovers, and that can deploy and retract at least 5 times. Retraction will allow valuable solar array hardware to be relocated, repurposed, or refurbished and possibly also to minimize nearby rocket plume loads and dust accumulation. Also, innovations to raise the bottom of the solar array by up to 10 m above the surface to reduce shadowing from local terrain are required [Ref. 3]. The ability to be relocated is assumed to be through use of a separate surface-mobility system (i.e., not part of the solar array system), but design of array structures and mechanisms should accommodate loads likely to be encountered during transport along the lunar surface. Suitable variations of existing array concepts [e.g., Ref. 4-5] are of special interest. Design guidelines for these deployable/retractable solar arrays are:Deployed area: 35 m2 (10 kW at beginning of life) per unit. Single-axis sun tracking about the vertical axis. Up to 10-m height extension boom to reduce shadowing from local terrain. Deployable, stable base for supporting tall vertical array on unprepared lunar surface. Base must accommodate a local 15º terrain slope. Adjustable leveling to within 1º of vertical. Retractable for relocating, repurposing, or refurbishing. Number of deploy/retract cycles in service: >5; stretch goal >10. Lunar dust, radiation, and temperature resistant components. Specific mass: >75 W/kg including all mechanical and electrical components. Specific packing volume: >20 kW/m3 including all mechanical and electrical components. Factor of safety of 1.5 on all components. Lifetime: 10 years. Suggested areas of innovation include:Novel array and support base packaging, deployment, retraction, and modularity concepts. Lightweight, compact components including booms, trusses, ribs, substrates, and mechanisms. Novel actuators for telescoping solar arrays such as gear/rack, piezoelectric, ratcheting, or rubber-wheel drive devices. Mechanisms with exceptionally high resistance to lunar dust. Load-limiting devices to avoid damage during deployment, retraction, and solar tracking. Optimized use of advanced lightweight materials (but not materials development). Integration of existing structural health monitoring technologies. Validated modeling, analysis, and simulation techniques. Modular and adaptable solar array concepts for multiple lunar surface use cases. Completely new concepts; e.g., thinned rigid panel or 3D-printed solar arrays, nonrotating telescoping “chimney” arrays, or lightweight reflectors to redirect sunlight onto solar arrays or into dark craters. Proposals should emphasize structural and mechanical innovations, not photovoltaics, electrical, or energy storage innovations, although a complete solar array systems analysis is encouraged. If solar concentrators are proposed, strong arguments must be developed to justify why this approach is better from technical, cost, and risk points of view over unconcentrated planar solar arrays. Solar array concepts should be compatible with state-of-the-art solar cell technologies with documented environmental degradation properties. Design, build, and test of scaled flight hardware or functioning lab models to validate proposed innovations is of high interest.",4 to 5,"Level 1: TX 12 Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems, and Manufacturing

Software","In Phase I, contractors should prove the feasibility of proposed innovations using suitable analyses and tests. In Phase II, significant hardware or software capabilities that can be tested at NASA should be developed to advance their Technology Readiness Level (TRL). TRLs at the end of Phase II of 4 or higher are desired.","Deployable solar arrays power almost all spacecraft, but they primarily consist of hinged, rigid panels. This traditional design is too heavy and packages too inefficiently for lunar surface power. Furthermore, there is usually no reason to retract the arrays in space, so self-retractable solar array concepts are unavailable except for rare exceptions such as the special-purpose International Space Station (ISS) solar array wings. In recent years, several lightweight solar array concepts have been developed but none of them have motorized retraction capability either. The critical technology gap filled by this subtopic is a lightweight, vertically deployed, retractable 10-kW solar array for surface electrical power near the lunar South Pole for diverse needs including ISRU, lunar bases, dedicated power landers, and rovers.","Robust, lightweight, redeployable solar arrays for lunar surface applications are a topic of great current interest to NASA on its path back to the Moon. New this year, the subtopic extends the focus area from landers to other powered elements of the lunar surface architecture along with refined design guidelines. There are likely several infusion paths into ongoing and future lunar surface programs, both within NASA and also with commercial entities currently exploring options for a variety of lunar surface missions. Given the focus on the lunar South Pole, NASA will need vertically deployed and retractable solar arrays that generate 10 to 40 kW of power. The 10-kW-class solar array structures are also applicable for Science Mission Directorate (SMD) ConOps (concept of operations) on the Moon to recharge batteries on a Mars Science Laboratory- (MSL-) class rover.","

"Focus Area 15 Materials, Materials Research, Structures, and Assembly",T12.05Use of Additive Manufacturing for Thermal Protection Systems, JSC," ARC, GSFC, LaRC", 2021,Use of Additive Manufacturing for Thermal Protection Systems,"Background NASA has a need to significantly improve the manufacturing processes of Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) used on human-rated spacecraft and robotic missions with the intention of reducing cost and improving quality and system performance. The fabrication and installation of current TPS are labor intensive, cost prohibitive, and result in many seams between the segments. Future human missions to Mars will require the landing of large-mass payloads on the surface, and these large entry vehicles will require large areas of TPS to protect the structure. A sustained lunar presence will require the development of lunar-return vehicles, which will also need TPS. In order to reduce the cost and complexity of these vehicles, new TPS materials and compatible additive manufacturing (AM) techniques are needed such that both spacecraft TPS and structures can be manufactured with automated systems. Furthermore, a future capability to use AM to fabricate and repair TPS in space will be needed. Basic requirements and goals for the development of this technology are provided in this solicitation. Objectives The overall objective is to develop the materials and compatible AM technologies to automate the fabrication of an integrated spacecraft structure and TPS. There are two approaches to designing the spacecraft aeroshell: (1) parasitic TPS: design and fabricate the flight structure and apply the thermal protection to the structure surface and (2) integrated aeroshell: design and fabricate a high-temperature flight structure that forms the outer mold line and apply insulative thermal protection to the inner surfaces of the structure. Both of these approaches are of interest to NASA and have applications to future NASA missions. For the first approach, the objective for this solicitation is to develop the materials and processes to deposit and adhere the thermal protection to an existing structure. It can be assumed that the structure has already been designed and fabricated. For the second approach, the objective is to develop the materials and processes to fabricate both the high-temperature structure and the integrated, internal insulation. The proposer should select one of the design approaches to address. The intent of this solicitation is to develop the materials and technologies for automating the fabrication and integration of a thermal protection onto a spacecraft. Therefore, NASA is not interested in materials and methods to fabricate a better block of material that would need to be manually bonded onto a structure with gaps between the blocks. Material Characteristics AM has the potential to provide capabilities to design a material to achieve the desired properties and to vary the material constituents during the fabrication process. Fibers can be added and aligned to obtain desired mechanical and thermal properties. Additives can be used to reduce density and modify other key properties and to aid the fabrication process. Although it is not a requirement for this solicitation, material systems that have a potential future development path for reusability are desirable. The desired material properties depend on the spacecraft flight regime and the aeroshell design approach. For the purpose of this solicitation, three TPS options have been defined and the approximate desired material properties provided. Low-Density, Low Heat Flux (<60 W/cm2) Parasitic TPS:Density ~0.3 g/cc (or lower) CTE <5×10–6 1/°F Through-the-thickness thermal conductivity <0.1 W/m/K (at 1 atm and 70 °F) In-plane tensile strength >1.3 MPaHigh Heat Flux (100 to 600 W/cm2) Parasitic TPS:Density ~0.6 g/cc (or lower) CTE <5×10–6 1/°F Through-the-thickness thermal conductivity <0.2 W/m/K (at 1 atm and 70 °F) In-plane tensile strength >3 MPa Char yield >50%Moderate Heat Flux (>200 W/cm2) Integrated Aeroshell:Density: Structure ~1.5 g/cc; Insulation 0.3 to 0.5 g/cc CTE <5×10–6 1/°F Through-the-thickness thermal conductivity: Structure ~5 W/m/K; Insulation: <0.1 W/m/K (at 1 atm and 70 °F) In-plane tensile strength: Structure >120 MPa; Insulation: >1.3 MPa Char yield >50%Since additive manufacturing techniques provide the capability to vary the material during fabrication, combinations of the materials in a single system is of interest. For example, a system may consist of an outer layer of High Heat Flux Parasitic TPS and then transition to a low-density, low heat flux material closer to the structure. The proposer can select one or a combination of the material categories to address in their proposal. In order to achieve the desired properties and inhibit material failure in high aerodynamic shear environments, strategies that print a honeycomb or iso-grid reinforcement with filled cells may also be considered. Printing and Curing Approach The selected printing approach must be capable of fabricating the TPS using the selected materials and with limited manual intervention. The system must be scalable to fabricate TPS for flat and curved surfaces for vehicles several meters in diameter. A significant concern for all of the printed and cured materials is large porosity and voids. The proposer should describe controls to minimize these defects. Defects can be controlled by material and cure process selection and/or by print techniques. Print technique controls could include rollers/deflectors to consolidate the material and/or sensors and feedback loops during printing. Material curing, depending on the resin system, is often achieved by a thermal cycle in an oven. For this solicitation, oven cures are acceptable as long as the thermal cycle does not exceed 180 °C for the parasitic TPS. This constraint is driven by temperature limits on the flight structure. If curing is needed, it is highly desirable to cure the material in situ using the material chemistry, local heating, laser sintering, or ultraviolet/radiofrequency energy. The high-level goals for a scaled-up TPS additive manufacturing system are provided below.System should include all of the elements for the entire workflow from material formulation to fabrication and final finishing and print quality controls. System functions should be automated with minimal manual processes such that it can be operated by fewer than three technicians. Post-print processing should be minimized. For parasitic TPS, a 5-m-diameter dome should be completely fabricated within 1 month; 3 months for an integrated aeroshell of this size.",2 to 4,"Level 1: TX 12 Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems, and Manufacturing

Hardware","During Phase I, the proposer should:Develop the conceptual design of the entire manufacturing process tailored to the appropriate feed-stock proposed. Demonstrate the capability to fabricate using AM the candidate materials. Conduct material property tests and compare to goals. Conduct aerothermal tests of the printed material. Deliver to NASA small test articles for testing.During Phase II, the proposer should:Design and assemble a prototype automated system to fabricate the TPS. Demonstrate the capability to fabricate the TPS for nonplanar surfaces. Conduct material property tests for larger range of conditions. Conduct integrated TPS/structure tests such as flexure tests. Conduct aerothermal tests of the printed material.","Current state of the art (SOA) for manufacturing and installing thermal protection on NASA space vehicles is too labor intensive and costly. Furthermore, the heat shield designs are constrained by manufacturing processes that result in segmented blocks with gap fillers that create flight performance issues. To develop an automated additive manufacturing process for spacecraft heat shields that are monolithic, the development of the materials and technologies to deposit and cure the materials on the flight structures are needed.",Both Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) and Science Mission Directorate (SMD) would benefit from this technology. All missions that include a spacecraft that enters a planetary atmosphere require TPS to protect the structure from the high heating associated with hypersonic flight. Improved performance and lower cost heat shields benefit the development and operation of these spacecraft. Human missions to the Moon and Mars would benefit from this technology. Commercial Space programs would also benefit from TPS materials and manufacturing processes developed by NASA.,"

"Focus Area 15 Materials, Materials Research, Structures, and Assembly",T12.07Design Tools for Advanced Tailorable Composites, LaRC, MSFC, 2021,Design Tools for Advanced Tailorable Composites,"Affordable space exploration beyond the lower Earth orbit will require innovative lightweight structural concepts. Use of composite material systems is one of the means of lightweighting exploration vehicles, space habitats, and other space hardware. Lightweighting potential stemming from application of composite materials oftentimes fails to fully exploit the potential for reducing mass due to the lack of design tools tailored to yield designs with optimal load paths. Consequently, highly tailorable material systems are commonly used to produce quasi-isotropic (“black aluminum”) or otherwise off-optimal designs.This solicitation seeks to advance the design capabilities for layered pre-impregnated composite materials reinforced with either continuous or short fibers and with a wide variety of ply thicknesses, from ultrathin (with the fiber areal weight in single digits when expressed in grams per square meter (gsm)), to standard (approx. in the 145- to 190-gsm range). A design tool development and its demonstration to a relevant structure is sought. The design tool shall be developed leveraging the broadly adopted and accessible engineering codes including but not limited to MSC.Patran/Nastran, Abaqus, Hypersizer, Hyperworks, LSOPT, etc. Development in a form of “wrapper” or “plug-in” codes is strongly preferred over redeveloping functionalities that readily exist and can be incorporated within the design tool. Intuitive user-friendly code interfaces for the design definition set up are also highly desirable.Demonstration problems of interest include fiber-steered or otherwise highly tailored structural designs representative of cryogenic tanks, pressurized habitats, and other primary space structure components, including dry and unpressurized, such as lander truss cages or landing gears. Advantages of a new highly tailored composite design shall be demonstrated by its weight-saving potential over a legacy/conventional design while observing typical manufacturability constraints (determined, e.g., based on a literature survey). Other aspects, such as improved damage tolerance, extended service time, reusability, lower cost, or multifunctionality are also considered significant. Demonstration of improved performance of a highly tailored design relative to a conventional composite design (e.g., black aluminum approach) satisfies the requirements of this solicitation. However, comparisons to the metallic designs are also of interest as they ultimately can demonstrate the design goodness progression in the three-element series involving metallic, conventional composite, and highly tailored composite designs. Examples of relevant applications include but are not limited to current vehicle architectures being constrained for the return to the Moon missionsare to fit within a 15-ft-diameter shroud, thus tank and habitat maximum dimensions are likely on the order of this 15-ft-diameter constraint. For tanks, nominal operating pressures in the range of 40 to 65 psi are considered common. The internal pressures for habitats can be guided by the International Space Station's internal pressure of 14.7 psi.While a global-local analysis might be beneficial and warranted in the overall design process, demonstration problems can include smaller structural components, such as hardpoint attachment brackets, fittings, clevises, etc. Ability of the proposed design approach and related code to tailor not only general sections/acreages but also highly discontinuous sections of primary structures, such as hatches, windows, or hardpoint attachments present within the thin-wall overall architecture are highly sought features of the proposed design tool.",5 to 6,"Level 1: TX 12 Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems, and Manufacturing

Research","Phase I of the award shall deliver a proposed implementation of the design tool with a functioning code, however, its capabilities can be truncated relative to the overall proposed development. The truncated code shall include enough capabilities to be able to produce a simplified demonstration case that would also constitute a part of the Phase I deliverable. The Phase II deliverable shall include a releasable version of the design tool with the complete proposed functionality and a refined demonstration study case. For both Phase I and II developments, an open code architecture is of value such that the end users can gain insight into the implementation and possibly alter or add functionalities. From a practical standpoint, use of Python in conjunction with Abaqus implementation or PCL in conjunction with MSC.Patran/Nastran implementation might be considered examples of “open architectures.” Use of an existing design optimization tool, for example, LSOPT, is also allowed and encouraged.",Present composite designs are typically limited to straight fiber arrangements and lamination stacking sequences resulting in quasi-isotropic material properties. No commercially available design tools exist to produce advanced highly tailorable designs with optimized load paths.,"Examples of potential uses include: Space Technology Mission Directorate, Artemis/HLS programs, developers of air-launched systems (e.g., Generation Orbit Launch Services; Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate) next-generation airframe technology beyond ""tube and wing"" configurations (e.g., hybrid/blended wing body).","

"Focus Area 15 Materials, Materials Research, Structures, and Assembly","Z4.04Real-Time Defect Detection, Identification, and Correction in Wire-Feed and Fused-Filament Additive Manufacturing", LaRC, MSFC, 2021,"Real-Time Defect Detection, Identification, and Correction in Wire-Feed and Fused-Filament Additive Manufacturing","Additive manufacturing (AM) (also referred to here as 3D printing) offers the ability to build lightweight components that are optimally suited for use in aerospace applications. AM can also support sustainable exploration of the surfaces of the Moon and Mars by enabling needed components to be fabricated onsite. Significant strides have been made in the development of AM, with 3D-printed components now being part of active aircraft and spacecraft. While the use of AM has enabled nontraditional designs and decreased part counts, full inspection of each component is typically required postbuild to determine fitness for the final application. Complex geometries, rough as-built surface finishes, and porosity can hinder inspection. If 100% inspection is not possible, proof test logic or some other method of proving fitness for use must be applied. Defects that occur can force a complete reprint. The ultimate promise of AM is to enable on-demand production of customized unique components. For utility in space applications, printed parts have to be fully functional, with zero to minimal postprocessing. Ideally, parts need to be built with acceptable form, fit, and function the first time, with sufficient documentation to allow direct entry into service. To enable the full realization of the potential of 3D printing, a capability for closed-loop control of the process that integrates in situ monitoring, real-time defect detection and identification, and print parameter modification is required. Wire-feed or extrusion-type AM, with its relative simplicity, wide range of feedstocks, and build volume flexibility, is a popular 3D-printing technique that is well suited to space applications. Fused filament fabrication (FFF) of thermoplastics and electron beam free-form fabrication (EBF3) of metals are useful examples of wire-feed processes to illustrate the limitations placed on AM by presently available design and process control tools. After designing an object using 3D modeling software, the geometry is passed to a slicing and tool path planning code, which generates the list of instructions needed by the printing hardware. Once received by the printer, no further modifications or corrections can be made, and the process continues to completion. Proposals are invited to advance the manufacturing technology by incorporating an in situ defect detection and correction capability into wire-feed processing of metallic parts and FFF or related extrusion processing of thermoplastic, thermoset, or composite components. In Phase I, contractors should prove the feasibility of integrating sensor feedback with appropriate software tools and computation resources to be able to detect defects during fabrication of parts with complex geometries, evaluating the potential impact of the defects to the part performance and the correction of those defects. Solutions sought include software that can be integrated into the 3D-printing workflow, hardware requirements to run that software for real-time data processing, and sensors capable of operating in the build environment to provide data, also in real time. The proposed approach should be demonstrable at least on the coupon scale for shapes such as circles or boxes. The proposed solution must include all of the following: (1) defect sensing and detection, (2) assessment of the impact of the defect on part performance, and (3) corrective actions other than scrapping of the build. Proposals that do not clearly include these three elements will be considered out of scope. Phase II should demonstrate the feasibility of Phase I concepts to arrive at closed-loop solutions to build parts in which information on the processing generated from gathering and analyzing sensor data is used for the prediction of part performance, unique to each individual part, as it is being built. Incorporation of defect correction during fabrication, rather than requiring a print to be scrapped and restarted, should be demonstrated on sample parts.",2 to 3,"Level 1: TX 12 Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems, and Manufacturing

The complexity of defects that are detected and corrected, as well as the size of the parts, should demonstrate the challenges that would come up in full-scale use of the control processes. Printed part sizes should be at least 10 cm per side for cubes, with detectable defects down to the mm scale or smaller. The defects should have a demonstrable effect on the part performance, such as a decrease in mechanical properties, that is then corrected for by the process.","AM is seeing rapidly expanding applications in many areas, including in aerospace. Despite this growth in AM, filling its full potential has always been limited by quality-control issues and certification of the manufactured parts, as each component that is built is unique. Some work has begun to add defect detection and correction to powder-based manufacturing processes, such as direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) and wire-feed AM. There has, however, not been the requisite advance in ensuring that defect detection and identification is coupled with the real-time correction of those defects and ensuring final performance of the manufactured part in a particular application.Gap: Real-time defect detection, identification, and correction in AM processes that would ensure the performance of the as-printed parts without relying on postproduction inspection processes, with parts built with acceptable form, fit, and function the first time, with sufficient documentation to allow direct entry into service, has not been demonstrated.","This topic fits under STMD (Space Technology Mission Directorate). It supports Advanced Manufacturing of Lightweight Structures. Enhancing quality control in AM opens up its use in many industrial applications as well as its use by NASA. In particular, in-space use of AM in future Gateway, lunar, and Mars exploration missions will require that parts that are produced are ready for use as-produced, because there will be limitations in availability of material for reprinting as well as limitations on crew time and equipment for postprinting inspection.","

"Focus Area 15 Materials, Materials Research, Structures, and Assembly","Z4.05Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) Sensors, Modeling, and Analysis", LaRC," ARC, GSFC", 2021,"Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) Sensors, Modeling, and Analysis","NASA’s NDE SBIR subtopic will address a wide variety of NDE disciplines. These disciplines include but are not limited to structural health monitoring (SHM), novel NDE sensor development, and NDE modeling and analysis. All three of these disciplines can be used on aerospace structures and materials systems, including but not limited to Inconel, titanium, aluminum, carbon fiber, Avcoat, ATB-8, Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA), and thermal blanket structures. Sensor systems, SHM, and modeling can target any set of these materials in common aerospace configurations, such as micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) shielding, truss structures, and stiffened structures. In addition, NDE can target material and material systems in a wrought state in process, and NDE techniques that could be used to inspect additively manufactured components post production would be favored. Current NDE computational tools do not have sufficient resolution to provide representation on the order of finite-element models (FEMs) allowing for a digital twin. Depending on the size of the critical flaw in the material system/structure, this resolution can range from 500 nm to 100 cm realistically. As NDE tool resolution grows, larger volumes ofdata are created, and thus new computational tools are required. At the same time, low-cost emerging computational hardware, such as graphics processing units (GPUs), is enabling the growing use of advanced physics-based models for improved NDE inspection and for advanced data analysis methods such as machine learning. In addition, as NASA strives to go deeper and longer, new tools need to be developed in order to support long-duration spaceflight. NDE Sensors and Data Analysis Technologies enabling the ability to perform inspections on large complex structures will be encouraged. Technologies should provide reliable assessments of the location and extent of damage. Methods are desired to perform inspections in areas with difficult access in pressurized habitable compartments and external environments for flight hardware. Many applications require the ability to see through assembled conductive and/or thermal insulating materials without contacting the surface. Techniques that can dynamically and accurately determine position and orientation of the NDE sensor are needed to automatically register NDE results to precise locations on the structure. Advanced processing and displays are needed to reduce the complexity of operations for astronaut crews who need to make important assessments quickly. NDE inspection sensors are needed for potential use on free-flying inspection platforms. Integration of wireless systems with NDE may be of significant utility. It is strongly encouraged that proposals provide an explanation of how the proposed techniques and sensors will be applied to a complex structure. Examples of structural components include but are not limited to multiwall pressure vessels, batteries, tile, thermal blankets, micrometeoroid shielding, International Space Station (ISS) radiators, or aerospace structural components.Additionally, techniques for quantitative data analysis of sensor data are desired. It is also considered highly desirable to develop tools for automating detection of material foreign object debris (FOD) and/or defects and evaluation of bondline and in-depth integrity for lightweight rigid and/or flexible ablative materials. Typical internal void volume detection requirements for ablative materials are on the order of less than 6 mm, and bondline defect detection requirements are less than 25 mm.Additive manufacturing is rapidly becoming a manufacturing method targeting fracture-critical components; as such, NDE requirements will become more stringent. Additively manufactured components represent a novel challenge for NDE due to the layering nature of the process and its effect on diffracting energy sources. Development of NDE techniques, sensors, and methods addressing these issues would be highly desired, but techniques addressing weld inspection will also be considered. Most of the aerospace components will be metallic in nature, and critical flaws are on the range of 1 mm or smaller and can be volumetric or fracturelike in nature.Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)Future manned space missions will require spacecraft and launch vehicles that are capable of monitoring the structural health of the vehicle and diagnosing and reporting any degradation in vehicle capability. This subtopic seeks new and innovative technologies in SHM and integrated vehicle health management (IVHM) systems and analysis tools.Techniques sought include modular/low mass-volume systems; low-power, low-maintenance systems; and systems that reduce or eliminate wiring, as well as standalone smart-sensor systems that provide processed data as close to the sensor as practical and systems that are flexible in their applicability. Examples of possible systems include surface-acoustic-wave- (SAW-) based sensors, passive wireless sensor tags, flexible sensors for highly curved surfaces, and direct-write film sensors. Damage detection modes include leak detection, ammonia detection, micrometeoroid impact, and others. Reduction in the complexity of standard wires and connectors and enabling sensing functions in locations not normally accessible with previous technologies is also desirable. Proposed techniques should be capable of long-term service with little or no intervention. Sensor systems should be capable of identifying material state awareness and distinguishing aging-related phenomena and damage-related conditions. It is considered advantageous that these systems perform characterization of age-related degradation in complex composite and metallic materials. Measurement techniques and analysis methods related to quantifying material thermal properties, elastic properties, density, microcrack formation, fiber buckling and breakage, etc., in complex composite material systems and in adhesively bonded/built-up and/or polymer-matrix composite sandwich structures are of particular interest. Some consideration will be given to the IVHM/SHM ability to survive in on-orbit and deep space conditions, allow for additions or changes in instrumentation late in the design/development process, and enable relocation or upgrade on orbit. The system should allow NASA to gain insight into performance and safety of NASA vehicles as well as commercial launchers, vehicles, and payloads supporting NASA missions.Inclusion of a plan for detailed technical operation and deployment is highly favored.NDE ModelingTechnologies sought under this SBIR include near real-time realistic NDE and SHM simulations and automated data reduction/analysis methods for large datasets. Simulation techniques will seek to expand NASA’s use of physics-based models to predict inspection coverage for complex aerospace components and structures and to utilize inverse methods for improved defect characterization. Analysis techniques should include optimized automated reduction of NDE/SHM data for enhanced interpretation appropriate for detection/characterization of critical flaws in space-flight structures and components, and may involve methods such as machine learning and domain transformation. NASA's interest area is lightweight structural materials for spaceflight, such as composites and thin metals. Future purposes will include application to long-duration space vehicles as well as validation of SHM systems.Techniques sought include advanced material-energy interaction (i.e., NDE) simulations for high-strength lightweight material systems and include energy interaction with realistic damage in complex 3D component geometries (such as bonded/built-up structures). Primary material systems can include metals, but it is highly desirable to target composite structures. NDE/SHM techniques for simulation can include ultrasonic, laser, microwave, terahertz, infrared, x-ray, x-ray computed tomography, fiber optic, backscatter x-ray, and eddy current. It is assumed that any data analysis methods will be focused on NDE techniques with high-resolution, high-volume data. Modeling efforts should be physics-based, and it is desired that they can account for material aging characteristics and induced damage, such as micrometeoroid impact. Examples of damage states of interest include delamination, microcracking, porosity, and fiber breakage. Techniques sought for data reduction/interpretation will yield automated and accurate results to improve quantitative data interpretation to reduce large amounts of NDE/SHM data into a meaningful characterization of the structure. It is advantageous to use coprocessor/accelerator-based hardware (e.g., field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and GPUs) for simulation and data reduction. Combined simulation and data reduction/interpretation techniques should demonstrate ability to guide the development of optimized NDE/SHM techniques, lead to improved inspection coverage predictions, and yield quantitative data interpretation for damage characterization.",1 to 6,"Level 1: TX 08 Sensors and Instruments

Development of new techniques are enabling Orion to meet its 100% inspected mission directive. In addition, as NASA strives to go deeper and longer, new tools need to be developed in order to support long-duration spaceflight.","Several missions could benefit from technology developed in the area of NDE. Currently, NASA is returning to manned spaceflight. The Artemis program's Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System have had inspection difficulties, and continued development and implementation of NDE tools will serve to keep our missions flying safely. Currently, Orion is using several techniques and prototypes that have been produced under the NDE SBIR topic. The Space Launch System is NASA’s next heavy-lift system, capable of sending hundreds of metric tons into orbit. Inspection of the various systems is ongoing and will continue to have challenges, such as verification of the friction stir weld on the fuel tanks. As NASA continues to push into deeper space, smart structures that are instrumented with SHM systems can provide real-time mission-critical information on the status of the structure.","

"Focus Area 15 Materials, Materials Research, Structures, and Assembly",Z4.06Manufacturability Assessment as a Design Constraint for Advanced Tailorable Composites, LaRC, MSFC, 2021,Manufacturability Assessment as a Design Constraint for Advanced Tailorable Composites,"While use of composite material systems in space vehicle structures is increasing, their broader implementation is still facing multiple challenges. One of these challenges, especially relevant in the context of advanced tailorable composites, is a manufacturability assessment that could be leveraged as a design constraint early in the development. Absence of a reliable and comprehensive manufacturability assessment often restricts exploitation of the full potential of the composite material system and promotes conservative fabrication approaches that can negate potential mass benefits of composites. Suboptimal designs such as quasi-isotropic lamination stacking sequence treat the material as “black aluminum,” failing to permit tailored load paths possible with composites. Consequently, a material system that can enable large reductions in system mass ends up being used in the design process in a way that results in structural components that are much heavier than necessary.This solicitation seeks to advance the analytical predictive manufacturability assessment capabilities for layered composites. Such an assessment is required as a constraint in the structural design and optimization process. Layered pre-impregnated composite materials reinforced with either continuous or short fibers, and with a broad spectrum of ply thicknesses, are in the scope of this solicitation. For the continuous-fiber composites, the typical fiber areal weights range from approximately 30 grams per square meter (gsm) to just under 200 gsm. For short-fiber applications, the ultrathin plies in the single-digit gsm range are also of interest. Since a broad variety of composite material systems is within the scope of this solicitation, the scope of related manufacturability constraints can be tailored to the proposed material system. Consequently, the examples of manufacturability considerations provided in this solicitation are not all-inclusive, and parameters not listed below can be offered up for investigation when a compelling rationale is presented. The list of potential implementations of advanced tailorable composites is also provided to aid in the determination of manufacturing constraints of primary importance. The overarching approach should be based on recognizing that the more aggressive the tailoring of a composite material system, the greater the risk of developing defects in the manufacturing process. While avoiding any defects can be one countermeasure, quantifying the effects of defects can provide additional insights. Specifically, if the effect of defect can be quantified and it can be demonstrated that the benefits gained from the associated design tailoring can overcome the adverse effect of a small defect, then a rationale for the more aggressive tailoring can be justified. Examples of defects include, but are not limited to, tow gaps, overlaps, foldovers, or poor compaction/separation from the underlying plies. In cases where a placement imperfection can be subjected to restorative actions, analysis of how successful such actions can be is also of value.The manufacturability assessment shall be based on analytical tools validated with experimentation/actual manufacturability trials. Examples of the performance-based manufacturing constraints for the continuous-fiber composites include, but are not limited to, determination of the minimum allowable steering radius, relative proximity of ply terminations such that no significant adverse interaction occurs, and minimizing thermal warping in the cure process when nonsymmetric lamination stacking sequence is present. For example, one of the important examples of the manufacturability assessment for short-fiber composites is determination of an initial preform thickness distribution that would produce a desired thickness distribution after forming that involves preform expansion and/or turning or steering (i.e., forming similar to deep-stamping or closed-cross-section forming with a clamshell tool and an expandable bladder). Similarly, estimation of the short-fiber orientation distortions in the forming process and predictive countermeasures to this behavior are also sought.Subscale manufacturing demonstrations representative of the challenges that can be encountered in the full-scale applications are sought as the manufacturability predictive analysis validation cases. The full-scale structures of interest that can be scaled down for the manufacturing demonstrations include cryogenic tanks, crew modules, pressurized habitats, and other dry and unpressurized primary structural components or portions of thereof. Discrete features such as hatches, access and windows cutouts, and hard point attachments can be considered as manufacturability challenges to be encountered in the full-scale applications in addition to the general acreage considerations. Furthermore, manufacturability assessment for short-fiber composites is expanded to allow smaller size demonstrations, for example, those representative of hard point attachment brackets, hinges, clevises, etc.",5 to 6,"Level 1: TX 12 Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems, and Manufacturing

A manufacturing demonstration article and the computational tool available for release shall be delivered at the conclusion of Phase II.","Present composite designs are typically limited to straight fiber arrangements and lamination stacking sequences resulting in quasi-isotropic material properties. Apart from the lack of structural design and optimization tools, highly tailored fabrication of composites presents manufacturing challenges and is prone to introducing manufacturing defects. Manufacturability assessment is often performed via the trial-and-error approach, which is costly, time consuming, and very limited in scope. A validated computational manufacturability assessment tool would enable more rapid and comprehensive manufacturability assessment that can inform the design effort in its early stages.","Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), Artemis/HLS (human landing systems) programs, developers of air-launched systems, e.g., Generation Orbit Launch Services.

Focus Area 16 Ground & Launch Processing,H10.01Advanced Propulsion Systems Ground Test Technology, SSC, KSC, 2021,Advanced Propulsion Test Technology Development,"Rocket propulsion development is enabled by rigorous ground testing to mitigate the propulsion system risks that are inherent in spaceflight. This is true for virtually all propulsive devices of a space vehicle including liquid and solid rocket propulsion, chemical and nonchemical propulsion, boost stage, in-space propulsion, and so forth. It involves a combination of component and engine-level testing to demonstrate the propulsion devices were designed to meet the specified requirements for a specified operational envelope over robust margins and shown to be sufficiently reliable prior to its first flight. This topic area seeks to develop advanced ground test technology components and system level ground test systems that enhance chemical and advanced propulsion technology development and certification. The goal is to advance propulsion ground test technologies to enhance environment simulation; minimize test program time, cost, and risk; and meet existing environmental and safety regulations. It is focused on near-term products that augment and enhance proven, state-of-the-art propulsion test facilities. This project is especially interested in ground test and launch environment technologies with potential to substantially reduce the costs and improve safety/reliability of NASA's test and launch operations. In particular, technology needs include stable combustion of oxygen and hydrogen in a low-pressure duct, developing robust materials, and advanced instruments and monitoring systems capable of operating in extreme temperature and harsh environments. This subtopic seeks innovative technologies in the following areas:Design of technology/techniques for oxygen injection into a duct that assures stable combustion with hot (>1,700 R) hydrogen at low pressure (<25 psia), having an oxidizer to fuel mixture ratio of 9 for an oxygen flow rate of approximately 2.7 lbm/sec. This technology solution must be extensible to a system having an oxygen flow rate of approximately 270 lbm/sec. Devices for measurement of pressure, temperature, strain, and radiation in a high temperature and/or harsh environment. Development of innovative rocket test facility components (e.g., valves, flowmeters, actuators, tanks, etc.) for ultrahigh pressure (>8,000 psi), high flow rate (>100 lbm/sec), and cryogenic environments. Robust and reliable component designs which are oxygen compatible and can operate efficiently in high-vibroacoustic environments. Advanced materials to resist high-temperature (<4,400 °F), hydrogen embrittlement, and harsh environments. Tools using computational methods to accurately model and predict system performance, that integrate simple interfaces with detailed design and/or analysis software, are required. Stennis Space Center (SSC) is interested in improving capabilities and methods to accurately predict and model the transient fluid structure interaction between cryogenic fluids and immersed components to predict the dynamic loads and frequency response of facilities. Improved capabilities to predict and model the behavior of components (valves, check valves, chokes, etc.) during the facility design process are needed. This capability is required for modeling components in high pressure (to 12,000 psi), with flow rates up to several thousand lb/sec, in cryogenic environments and must address two-phase flows. Challenges include: accurate, efficient, thermodynamic state models; cavitation models for propellant tanks, valve flows, and run lines; reduction in solution time; improved stability; acoustic interactions; and fluid-structure interactions in internal flows.For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards Phase II hardware/software demonstration with delivery of a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.",4 to 6,"Level 1: TX 13 Ground, Test, and Surface Systems

Specifically, the goal is to reduce costs of propellants and other fluids; reduce logistics costs; reduce times required for ground processing and launch; reduce mission risk; and reduce hazards exposure to personnel.There is a broad range of technologies needed to support rocket propulsion testing. Dynamic fluid flow simulation is used to characterize and model the facility performance in a highly dynamic environment with NASA, Department of Defense (DOD), and commercial customers. Multiple issues remain with modeling combustion instabilities and component/facility performance. These issues can have catastrophic results if not understood completely. New test programs will require the materials to withstand extreme temperatures and harsh environments. Next-generation testing requires the ability to produce very high temperature hydrogen at high near-continuous flow rates to verify component and facility performance. The extreme and harsh environment also requires advancements in mechanical components and instrumentation.","This subtopic is relevant to the development of liquid propulsion systems development and verification testing in support of the Human Exploration and Mission Operations Directorate (HEOMD), all test programs at SSC, and other propulsion system development centers.","

Focus Area 16 Ground & Launch Processing,H10.02Autonomous Operations Technologies for Ground and Launch Systems, KSC," ARC, LaRC, SSC", 2021,Autonomous Operations Technologies for Ground and Launch Systems,"For the scope of this solicitation, ground systems are considered to be the planetary or lunar surface-based infrastructure and processes used to assemble, validate, support, and maintain launch vehicles and payloads (including nonspacecraft payloads) in preparation for flight. Launch systems are considered to be the planetary or lunar surface-based infrastructure and processes used to transition launch vehicles to flight operation. Autonomous operations technologies (AOT) are required to manage ground and launch systems activities where human intervention/interaction/presence needs to be minimized or eliminated, such as in hazardous locations/operations and in support of remote operations. AOT are required to reduce operations and maintenance (O&M) costs of flight system and payload processing operations on the ground, and to increase ground systems availability to support mission operations. AOT will also be required for extended surface O&M on the Moon and Mars. AOT performs functions such as system and component fault prediction and diagnostics, anomaly detection, fault detection and isolation, and enables various levels of autonomous control and recovery from faults, where recovery may include system repair and/or reconfiguration. AOT are enabled by Health Management (HM) technologies, methodologies, and approaches; command, monitoring and control architectures; computing architectures; software for decision making and control; and intelligent components and devices. AOT will be integrated into activities performed by rocket engine test facilities, propellant servicing systems, and processing and launch of vehicles and payloads. AOT will enable surface O&M, which requires a high degree of autonomy and reliability for unattended operations during extended periods of time. AOT will complement in situ resource utilization (ISRU) operations by supporting ISRU ground systems infrastructure with O&M autonomy. AOT enables Autonomous Propellant Management (APM), which requires unattended or minimally attended storage, transfer, monitoring, and sampling of cryogenic propellants, or other propellants used in launch vehicles and maneuvering systems. APM includes preplanned nominal processes, such as vehicle fill and drain, as well as contingency and off-nominal processes, such as emergency safing, venting, and system reconfiguration. AOT solutions may enable the autonomous command, monitoring, and control of entire integrated systems, such as a propellant loading system and all other associated support systems involved in the loading process. AOT will also support tasks such as systems setup, testing and checkout, troubleshooting, maintenance, upgrades, and repair. These additional tasks drive the need for autonomous element-to-element interface connection and separation, multi-element inspection, and recovery of high-value cryogenic propellants and gases to avoid system losses. AOT software may include prerequisite control logic (PCL) and reactive control logic (RCL), and may utilize machine learning or other forms of artificial intelligence to manage nominal system behavior and adapt to off-nominal conditions. In addition to propellants, propellant management systems may utilize additional commodities to prepare a vehicle for launch, such as high-pressure gases for purging, pressurization, or conditioning. Propellant management systems may also include power and data interfaces with the vehicle to configure vehicle valves or other internal systems and observe vehicle states during propellant management operations. Specifically, this subtopic seeks the following:Development of technologies for automated/autonomous propellant (including cryogenic propellants) management and the servicing of commodities for launch vehicles and payloads. Development of high-fidelity physics-based cryogenic-thermal models and ground process simulations capable of real-time and faster than real-time performance. Development of automated/autonomous algorithms for ground systems applications. Machine learning environments (simulation and learning agent) for ground systems processes and applications. Development of high-fidelity models and simulations for complex payload system processing, servicing, maintenance, etc. Development of test and evaluation (T&E), and verification and validation (V&V) methods for automated/autonomous algorithms, models, and simulations. Development of technologies for ground systems Health Determination and Fault Management. Prediction, prognosis, and anomaly detection algorithms and applications.

Intelligent devices (sensors, actuators, and electronics with self-diagnosis capabilities, calibration on demand, self-healing capabilities, etc.). Standardization of architectures and interfaces for ground and launch systems.

Focus Area 16 Ground & Launch Processing,T13.01Intelligent Sensor Systems, SSC," ARC, LaRC, SSC", 2021,Advanced Instrumentation for Rocket Propulsion Testing,"Rocket propulsion system development is enabled by rigorous ground testing to mitigate the propulsion system risks inherent in spaceflight. Test articles and facilities are highly instrumented to enable a comprehensive analysis of propulsion system performance. Advanced instrumentation has the potential for substantial reduction in time and cost of propulsion systems development, with substantially reduced operational costs and evolutionary improvements in ground, launch, and flight system operational robustness.Advanced instrumentation would provide a wireless, highly flexible instrumentation solution capable of measurement of heat flux, temperature, pressure, strain, and/or near-field acoustics. Temperature and pressure measurements must be acquired from within the facility mechanical systems or the rocket engine itself. These advanced instruments should function as a modular node in a sensor network, capable of performing some processing, gathering sensory information, and communicating with other connected nodes in the network. The collected sensor network must be capable of integration with data from conventional data acquisition systems adhering to strict calibration and timing standards to support static propulsion system testing standards. Synchronization with Inter-Range Instrumentation Group—Time Code Format B (IRIG-B) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceability is critical to propulsion test data analysis.Rocket propulsion test facilities also provide excellent testbeds for testing and using the innovative technologies for possible application beyond the static propulsion testing environment. These sensors would be capable of addressing multiple mission requirements for remote monitoring such as vehicle health monitoring in flight systems, autonomous vehicle operation, or instrumenting inaccessible measurement locations, all while eliminating cabling and auxiliary power. It is envisioned these advanced instrumentation would support sensing and control applications beyond those of propulsion testing. For example, inclusion of expert system or artificial intelligence technologies might provide great benefits for autonomous operations, health monitoring, or self-maintaining systems.This subtopic seeks to develop advanced wireless instrumentation capable of performing some processing, gathering sensory information and communicating with other connected nodes in the network. Sensor systems should have the ability to provide the following functionality:Acquisition and conversion to engineering units for quantifying heat flux, temperature, pressure, strain, and/or near-field acoustics such that it contributes to rocket engine system performance analysis within established standards for error and uncertainty. Capable of in-place calibrations with NIST traceability. Collected data must be time-stamped to facilitate analysis with other collected datasets. Transfer data in real time to other systems for monitoring and analysis. Interface to flight-qualified sensor systems, which could be used for multivehicle use. Determine the quality of the measurement and instrument state of health. Self-contained to collect information and relay measurements through various means by a sensor-web approach to provide a self-healing, autoconfiguring method of collecting data from multiple sensors, and relaying for integration with other acquired datasets. Function reliably in extreme environments, including rapidly changing ranges of environmental conditions, such as those experienced in space. These ranges may be from extremely cold temperatures, such as cryogenic temperatures, to extremely high temperatures, such as those experienced near a rocket engine plume.",3 to 6,"Level 1: TX 13 Ground, Test, and Surface Systems

Hardware
Software","For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility with a final report at Phase I and show a path towards Phase II hardware/software demonstration with delivery of a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.","Highly modular, remote sensors are of interest to many NASA tests and missions. Real-time data from sensor networks reduces risk and provides data for future design improvements. Wireless sensors offer a highly flexible solution for scientists and engineers to collect data remotely. They can be used for thermal, structural, and acoustic measurement of systems and subsystems and also provide emergency system halt instructions in the case of leaks, fire, or structural failure. Other examples of potential NASA applications include (1) measuring temperature, strain, voltage, and current from power storage and generation systems, (2) measuring pressure, strain, and temperature in pumps and pressure vessels, and (3) measuring strain in test structures and ground support equipment and vehicles, including high-risk deployables.There are many other applications that would benefit from increased real-time sensing in remote hard-to-test locations. For example, sensor networks on a vehicle body can give measurement of temperature, pressure, strain, and acoustics. This data is used in real time to determine safety margins and test anomalies. The data is also used post-test to correlate analytical models and optimize vehicle and test design. Because these sensors are small and low mass, they can be used for ground test and for flight. Sensor module miniaturization will further reduce size, mass, and cost.No existing wireless sensor network option meets NASA’s current needs for flexibility, size, mass, and resilience to extreme environments.","This subtopic is relevant to the development of liquid propulsion systems development and verification testing in support of the Human Exploration and Mission Operations Directorate. It supports all test programs at Stennis Space Center (SSC) and other propulsion system development centers, and potential advocates are the Rocket Propulsion Test (RPT) Program Office and all rocket propulsion test programs at SSC.","

Current state-of-the-art, sprayable radiation-stable coatings are able to coat complex, irregular surfaces, but they are porous and will become imbedded with dust and particulates. Other surface films tend to be less optically stable and may charge in the plasma environment, thereby attracting lunar regolith to their surfaces. Mirrors have the limitations of requiring flat surfaces and are not conformal in nature. Currently, no single thermal control surface appears to provide stability, durability, and meet optical property requirements for sustained durations in space and lunar environments.",Many Science Mission Directorate (SMD) missions will greatly benefit from this dust mitigation thermal coating technology: any lunar-relating project and projects involved with robotic science rovers and landers.,"

Final report.,"The LHP evaporator contains a porous wick, which provides the capillary pumping capability to sustain the fluid flow in the loop. The smaller the pore size of the wick, the higher its capillary pumping capability. However, a smaller pore size results in a higher flow resistance that must be overcome by the capillary force. Traditional sintered metal wicks have a pore size on the order of 1 µm and porosity around 0.4 to 0.6. In order to replace the traditional porous wick, the new wick produced by the advanced manufacturing technology must have comparable pore size and porosity. The smallest pore size currently produced by direct metal laser sintering is on the order of 10 µm.","Traditional LHPs are used on many NASA missions including ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite), ICESat-2, Swift, Aura, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series (GOES-R), and Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT).

ALSEPs (Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Packages) were deployed on several Apollo missions and had select experiments that operated for many lunar cycles. However, both Lunokhod and ALSEP benefited from radioisotope heat and power sources, which are either too expensive or not likely to be available for near-term future lunar science experiments. In fact, most modern lunar surface mission planning is based on solar power and batteries and typically avoids the challenges associated with surviving the full lunar cycle or shadowed regions.While interest in lunar science and the development of abilities to deliver payloads to the lunar surface are resurgent, the capability to operate through the entire lunar environment is critical. In the absence of perpetual power supplies like radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), thermal management approaches to accommodate the lunar extremes, extended day/night cycles, and shadowed regions are seen as enabling.","Science Mission Directorate (SMD) lunar surface science investigations will employ small, low-power payloads that will require advanced thermal control approaches and techniques to survive and operate for extended duration through extreme thermal environments on the lunar surface.NASA has plans to purchase services for delivery of payloads to the Moon through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contract. Under this subtopic, proposals may include efforts to develop payloads for flight demonstration of relevant technologies in the lunar environment. The CLPS payload accommodations will vary depending on the particular service provider and mission characteristics. Additional information on the CLPS program and providers can be found at this link: https://www.nasa.gov/content/commercial-lunar-payload-services. CLPS missions will typically carry multiple payloads for multiple customers. Smaller, simpler, and more self-sufficient payloads are more easily accommodated and would be more likely to be considered for a NASA-sponsored flight opportunity. Commercial payload delivery services may begin as early as 2020, and flight opportunities are expected to continue well into the future.

Focus Area 17 Thermal Management Systems,Z2.01Spacecraft Thermal Management, JSC," GRC, GSFC, JPL, MSFC", 2021,Spacecraft Thermal Management,"NASA seeks new technologies that will facilitate low-mass and highly reliable thermal control systems for the exploration of our solar system. This solicitation specifically targets proposals for new technologies and methods that clearly address one of the following areas:Novel three-way valves that can operate to either mix or split single-phase fluid flow passively. Lunar lander/surface asset thermal technologies. Embedded cooling of power electronics. Concepts for closed-loop extravehicular activity (EVA) thermal systems.These areas are considered of equal priority, and no award preference is expected for one area over another.Passive Three-Way Valves NASA seeks novel three-way valves that can operate as either a mixing valve (two liquid input ports and one liquid output port) or splitting valve (one liquid input port and two liquid output ports) that can be used to passively control loop temperatures by the degree fraction of radiator bypass. Such miniature passive thermal control valves could find use in a number of single-phase mechanically pumped fluid thermal control systems. Proposed technologies must address the following design goals:Design shall autonomously operate without power. <0.1% flow rate through the shutoff port, with a goal of having a provision for no leakage/adjustable leakage through the use of a pre-installed orifice. Control range of 5 to 10 oC, with pre-adjustable setpoint control. Operational temperature limits -55 to 90 oC, nonoperational limits of -55 to 125 oC. Designs shall be compatible with FC-72 working fluid as well as with those used on the International Space Station (ISS) thermal control loops (water and ammonia). Retrofit of soft goods is acceptable. Mass desired <250 g (maximum mass 500 g). Unit volume <50 cm3 (maximum 100 cm3). Leak rate 1×10-6 scc/s gHe at 200 psia. Minimum 4,000 full actuation cycles, desired 17,500 cycles. Rad hard to 300 krad. 200 psia maximum expected operating pressure, 200 psia proof pressure, 800 psia burst pressure. Pressure drop <1.5 psi at 1.5 L/min of FC-72 working fluid. Lunar Surface Thermal Technology Development NASA is seeking focused efforts to develop large human-class lunar lander technologies. Technologies should address a gap associated to long-duration habitation on the lunar surface, where temperatures range from -193 °C or lower in shadow regions (including night) to 120° C at the equatorial subsolar point. System technologies should be orientation insensitive; for example, lander side-mounted radiators must provide their function regardless of lunar surface temperature condition. Technologies are needed that allow a single vehicle design to operate in all these environments. Technologies should address reduction in mass, volume, and power usage relative to current solutions. Adding heaters can lead to increased vehicle mass due to additional power generation and storage requirements and are not considered a novel architecture approach. Proposed radiator technologies should also address micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) robustness and protection potential where appropriate. Examples of other challenges to address in this area include the deposition of dust on radiators leading to degraded optical properties, contamination-insensitive evaporators/sublimators to enable long mission life, and self-healing coolant tubes for MMOD-impact resilience. Technologies should be suitable for use in medium-sized landers that operate near 1-kW average heat dissipation capacity. Alternatively, technologies that utilize the conditions provided by the lunar environment to provide a critical function may also be considered; for example, air-water separator technologies that leverage the gravity field of the lunar surface, or concepts that explore the viability of utilizing the lunar surface regolith to provide long-duration thermal control function. As appropriate, such systems should also address functional capability in the microgravity environment that will be experienced prior to lunar surface operations. Proposed technologies should also be extensible to human-class landers that will have variable heat loads and average loads between 2 and 6 kW. All technologies should support a minimum flight duration of 5 years and be compatible with the encountered aerospace environment. This subtopic is different from S3.06 subtopic, which is focused on thermal control technologies for payloads and smaller robotic landers. Technologies directly applicable to that scale vehicle should consider reviewing the S3.06 Thermal Control Systems subtopic. Embedded Cooling of Power Electronics To optimize the performance of state-of-the-art power and propulsion systems, it is often advantageous to directly embed thermal control mechanisms within the packaged hardware. The key advantages are to enable a lower temperature drop between the heat source and heat rejection to allow for higher rejection temperatures, to remove heat from concentrated areas (avoid localized hot spots), and to provide more uniform temperatures within the electronics package. Applications for such technologies range from very high power nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) systems, to compact laser diodes, to embedded cooling of rotating equipment. Here we specifically desire concepts that have the potential to efficiently manage high-performance power electronics in common compact packages. At the device level, applications such as low-inductance GaN packages rely on low thermal impedance heat-sinking strategies which also facilitate mechanical compliance and often electrical isolation. Current state-of-the-art thermal gap fillers have functional thermal impedances of 1.5 to 11 K/W for 12-mm2 GaN devices with thermal transfer of 200 to 400 mW/mm2 [Ref. 6]. Solutions that improve these thermal impedances values by >50% are sought. At the system level, NASA has interest in the cooling of standard 3U boards to assist in the Advanced Modular Power Systems (AMPS) program. This program calls for semiconductor to circuit board power transfer of >200 mW/mm2, circuit board to backplane interface >5mW/mm2, and backplane interface through wedgelock rail >15 mW/mm2 with minimum thermal impedance [Ref. 7]. Example solutions include but are not limited to single-phase liquid jet cooling, heat pipes, and evaporation techniques. Any proposed solution should consider the material compatibility with the heat source and heat delivery to the vehicle’s primary active thermal control system as well as any adverse effects on the cooled electronics. Here, solutions may consider integration with either a traditional single-phase (liquid) vehicle active thermal loop or a two-phase (liquid-vapor) mechanically pumped active thermal loop. Power requirements to operate active systems must be addressed with the goal to minimize power. The transient performance of the proposed mechanism should be considered within the scope of the award in order to identify any key limitations of the design. Closed-Loop EVA Thermal Technologies EVA thermal control has traditionally relied on the dissipation of water to space. The current suit relies on a water sublimator, whereas the next-generation exploration spacesuit will include a water evaporator. In either case, water is consumed at an average rate of ~1 lb/hr over the course of the spacewalk. Here, NASA seeks novel closed-loop EVA thermal control technologies that have general potential for integration into future iterations of spacesuit design. Concepts should address the following key performance parameters, at a minimum:Nominal average heat rejection >350 W. Accommodate peak heat rejection of at least 700 W for 15 min, with little or no consumable loss. Support EVA duration of at least 4 hr, stretch goal of 8 hr. Demonstrate viability of integration with the liquid cooling garment operating at a minimum continuous temperature between 8 and 10 oC. Time to regenerate/recharge the system <12 hr. Any regeneration/recharge impacts to the spacecraft should be addressed within the scope of the award (vehicle mass, power, volume impact assessment). Mechanism power <20 W including any controller electronics.",3 to 5,"Level 1: TX 14 Thermal Management Systems

Any delivered math models should include supporting data that validates the assumptions used within the model.","These focus areas strive to reduce mass, volume, and power of a thermal control system in the next generation of robotic and human-class spacecraft. Additionally, the exploration of embedded thermal control technologies may have a direct impact on the AMPS program in the near term and provide valuable insight into techniques for other embedded cooling applications. These improvements may come through either novel hardware solutions or modernization of software tools used to assess human vehicle interactions. The current state of the art in thermal control results in vehicle power and mass impact of greater than 25% to 30% due to old technologies still in use. Furthermore, as missions become more variable (dormancy, environments, etc.), the need for intelligent control (both actively and passively) within the thermal control system becomes more apparent. Science payloads will continue to decrease in size, increase in power, and require precise temperature control, all of which cannot be readily provided by traditional thermal control methods due to vehicle-level impacts of overall performance, mass/volume, and power.","Advanced Modular Power System Europa Clipper/Lander Lunar Lander Long-duration habitats (Moon, Mars, etc.) EVA","

Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,A1.01Aerodynamic and Structural Efficiency - Integration of Flight Control with Aircraft Multidisciplinary Design Optimization, ARC," AFRC, LaRC", 2021,Integration of Flight Control with Aircraft Multidisciplinary Design Optimization,"Successful design tools for advanced aircraft concepts typically require close interaction among the various design disciplines involved: aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, flight control, etc. This is particularly true for advanced modern transports such as the Boeing 787 and nontraditional aircraft concepts currently being studied at NASA, such as the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing or the blended wing body, where the level of coupling across the various disciplines can be very complex. It has been shown that substantial benefits could be realized by including many of these disciplines within a single multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) process, rather than optimizing each discipline in isolation. Furthermore, nontraditional flight control design philosophies are becoming increasingly more common as the aircraft industry is responding to the new urban air mobility (UAM) market. The NASA X-57, for example, could employ many modes of flight control distributed throughout the aircraft enabled by distributed electric propulsion. Thus, integration of flight control into an aircraft MDO process can produce more advanced aircraft design capabilities through improved and integrated methods and tools.This subtopic seeks proposals that develop new methods and tools that enable the inclusion of flight control in an aircraft MDO process. The proposed control approach should directly contribute to aircraft overall design objectives, such as fuel burn, aircraft takeoff gross weight, or other aircraft performance metrics. The resulting tightly coupled MDO environment should be capable of handling the interactions among relevant disciplines, such as structures, aerodynamics, flight control (including the control effector design parameters and actuator weight/power), and propulsion. Design variables may include structural details (e.g., skin thickness, structural layout, and materials), aerodynamic details (planform shape, jig twist, and airfoil shape distributions), control law details (type, objective function, and control gains), control effector and sensor design parameters (size, layout, locations, and quantity), propulsion design parameters (thrust distribution, integrated allocation, and scheduling), etc. The control law may be parameterized in such a way that the resulting parameters are suitable to a numerical optimizer. Control design tools may utilize advanced distributed sensors such as fiber optic shape sensors or surface pressure sensors to achieve improved aircraft design objectives.Appropriate design constraints should be imposed within the integrated MDO tool to ensure proper aerodynamic limits, such as stall and buffet; structural limits, such as maneuver and gust load response and flutter margins; as well as control-centric constraints, such as stability margins, control actuator power and authority, position and rate limits, and sensor and actuator requirements that dictate controllability and observability.Applications of these integrated MDO approaches could be implemented for realistic and relevant aircraft configurations to demonstrate the impact of the proposed methods. Performance gains should be actively derived from the system response to a control policy such as cruise-drag optimization, gust load alleviation, flutter suppression, flight-propulsion control, and multiobjective flight control. To integrate flight control into an MDO environment with a large number of design variables and constraints, new tools that would enable increased computational efficiency, such as adjoint-based optimization, are of interest using appropriate-fidelity aircraft models capable of capturing nonlinear aerodynamics. The proposed tools could be stand-alone or added capabilities to available open-sourced NASA MDO environments.This subtopic does not seek proposals that propose vehicle conceptual design and analysis studies or control methods that have no clear transition paths to commercial applications.",2 to 5,"Level 1: TX 15 Flight Vehicle Systems

Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,A1.02Quiet Performance - Airframe Noise Reduction, LaRC, GRC, 2021,Airframe Noise Reduction,"Innovative methods and technologies are necessary for the design and development of efficient and environmentally acceptable aircraft. In particular, the impact of aircraft noise on communities around airports is the predominant limiting factor on the growth of the nation's air transportation system. Reductions in aircraft noise could lead to wider community acceptance, lower airline operating costs where noise quotas or fees are employed, and increased potential for air traffic growth on a global scale. In support of the Advanced Air Vehicles Program (AAVP), Integrated Aviation Systems Program (IASP), and Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program (TACP), improvements in noise prediction and noise control are needed for subsonic, transonic, and supersonic vehicles targeted. Solutions are sought that target airframe noise sources and the noise sources due to the aerodynamic and acoustic interaction of the airframe and engines. Innovations in the following specific areas are solicited:Prediction and/or mitigation of aerodynamic noise sources including those from the airframe, propulsion-airframe interactions, or aeroacoustic integration effects associated with high-aspect ratio truss-braced vehicles. Concepts for active and passive control of broadband aeroacoustic noise sources for conventional, truss-braced, and other advanced aircraft configurations.

Advanced material systems for airframe noise control are still in their infancy, especially in the context of certifiability and robustness. Novel material systems that could be applied to component noise sources on the aircraft are needed, such as shape memory alloy actuators, or active or adaptive systems. In addition, future aircraft designs, such as high-aspect ratio, truss-braced configurations, are envisioned that either leverage noise benefits of complex geometrical configurations or introduce noise challenges with engine/airframe integration. Efficient computational tools that enable rapid-turn evaluations of multiple configurations at the design stage are lacking. Numerical methods to study complex engine/airframe configurations are complex and difficult to leverage at the aircraft design stage where configuration details are not specified. Improvements to numerical methods and models for studying the noise aspects of advanced airframe configurations, including engine integration, would ease consideration of acoustics in the design, rather than leaving acoustics to the late design stage where noise control solutions are costly and less effective. Improved tools would also enable more rapid evaluation and development of novel noise control approaches that may be needed for these novel aircraft configurations.","AAVP: The Advanced Air Transport Technology (AATT) and Commercial Supersonic Technology (CST) Projects would benefit from noise reduction technologies that could reduce the aircraft noise footprint at landing and takeoff. Configurations with novel engine placement, such as above the fuselage, can reduce the noise footprint, but technologies are needed to efficiently model the performance and noise impacts of these novel engine installations. In addition, novel configurations and technologies such as truss-braced wing and small-core turbofan engines will introduce new noise challenges that must be addressed to enable their successful deployment.TACP: The Transformational Tools and Technologies (TTT) Project would benefit from tool developments to enhance the ability to consider acoustics earlier in the aircraft design process. The TTT project would also benefit from the development and demonstration of simple material systems, such as advanced liner concepts with reduced drag or adaptive material and/or structures that reduce noise, as these component technologies could have application in numerous vehicle classes in the AAVP portfolio, including subsonic and supersonic transports as well as vertical lift vehicles.","

Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,A1.05Computational Tools and Methods, LaRC," ARC, GRC", 2021,Computational Tools and Methods,"Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) plays an important role in the design and development of a vast array of aerospace vehicles, from commercial transports to space systems. With the ever-increasing computational power, usage of higher fidelity, fast CFD tools and processes will significantly improve the aerodynamic performance of airframe and propulsion systems, as well as greatly reduce nonrecurring costs associated with ground-based and flight testing. Historically, the growth of CFD accuracy has allowed NASA and other organizations, including commercial companies, to reduce wind tunnel and single-engine component tests. Going forward, increased CFD fidelity for complete vehicle or engine configurations holds the promise of significantly reducing development costs, by enabling certification by analysis. Confidence in fast, accurate CFD and multidisciplinary analysis tools allow engineers to reach out of their existing design space and accelerate technology maturation schedules. Uncertainty quantification is a key technology in enhancing confidence in the prediction capability of the computational tools. NASA’s CFD Vision 2030 Study (https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140003093.pdf) highlighted the many shortcomings in the existing computational technologies used for conducting high-fidelity simulations, including multidisciplinary analysis and optimization, and made specific recommendations for investments necessary to overcome these challenges. High-quality mesh generation was recognized by the Vision Study as a bottleneck in the CFD workflow as it impacts both the solution accuracy and the time to solution. Therefore, improved mesh technology is a continued need for high-fidelity simulations and proposals are solicited in two focused areas related to the overall grid generation theme. First, adaptive mesh capabilities have been very successful in unstructured and Cartesian grid paradigms, but application to structured overset grids have been limited to mesh refinement based on solution gradients which leads to too many grid points for full-scale three-dimensional configurations. Mesh redistribution algorithms use a fixed number of grid points, and locally refine (and coarsen) the mesh to equally distribute the error. This allows the ""best"" solution for a fixed computation cost with respect to the defined error metric. Adaptive mesh redistribution algorithms are needed for structured overlapping grids that are robust in that given a valid structured overlapping grid system with no negative volumes, no orphan points, and a valid error-metric field, the redistributed mesh must also have no negative volumes and no orphans. The error metrics need to be based on solution and geometric gradients, solution Hessian, and adjoint-based error measures for achieving accurate lift and drag, pressure signatures, resolved turbulent kinetic energy, etc. These error-metric fields should be able to be read in and/or computed internally from an existing CFD solution. The error metric should be relevant to the CFD analysis being performed and the redistributed mesh should minimize the error with respect to the chosen metric. Finally, the cost of the redistribution algorithm (excluding the computation of the error-metric field in the case of an adjoint-based error metric) should only be a small percentage of the cost of a steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) CFD solve on the structured overlapping grid being analyzed, less than 10%. Many private companies utilize NASA-structured overset grid tools such as Chimera Grid Tools and OVERFLOW, and several mesh generation software companies continue to develop and enhance their own structured grid generation capabilities. The addition of a solution- (or adjoint-) based adaptive mesh redistribution software package will have a large impact on reducing the generation of accurate overset grids, database generation, reduce uncertainty in computed solutions, and provide quantitative measures of solution error. This will impact the quality of CFD analysis being performed and lead to better products by industry. The second focused grid-related area for which proposals are being solicited is automated and scalable mesh generation for wall-modeled large eddy simulations (WMLES). Unstructured approaches can be used to discretize highly complex flow configurations but, in addition to automation, there is a need to generate the mesh robustly and efficiently regardless of geometric complexity. The mesh quality aspect is especially critical for scale resolving simulations where numerical methods benefit significantly from element regularity and alignment. The goal of the solicited work is to encourage development of such mesh generation software that can be interfaced and integrated with NASA CFD solvers. The requirements for the solicited mesh software include: (1) it should be able to efficiently handle arbitrarily complex geometries; (2) the software should be message passing interface (MPI) parallel, scalable to billion+ cell meshes as are typical for NASA applications; (3) the mesh generation process needs to take a water-tight bounding volume definition as input, where the surface of the bounding volume can be marked with prescribed mesh resolution(s), in addition to any user prescribed volume refinement metrics (such as adjoint-based error metrics, prescribed volumes, etc.). Such mesh technology has the potential to drastically improve turn-around time for scale resolving simulations for complex configurations and enabling wider use of high-fidelity CFD analysis for challenging turbulent flow problems. This research effort is expected to enable NASA solvers to interface with the resulting tool. The meshing tool should be designed to perform well on the emerging high-performance computing hardware. An additional area of research may include adaptive mesh refinement while a WMLES is progressing. Another focused area of research and development within this subtopic is the prediction of aeroelastic effects with uncertainty quantification. Application of computational aeroelastic simulations involving complex flow fields (e.g., flow separation) toward practical engineering applications is hindered by many factors beyond the large computational cost. The large volume of output data must be postprocessed nondeterministically, and new data-based methods are required to adequately understand the output, and further draw connections between the flow and events/mechanisms of interest, such as aeroelastic flutter. These methods may include machine learning, nonlinear transforms, classical parameters indicative of flutter onset (e.g., aerodynamic center location and generalized aerodynamic forces), higher-order statistical characterizations, etc. In addition to statistical flow outputs, the inputs to the flow simulations are often uncertain as well; methods are then required to propagate these uncertainties through the flow simulation in a cost-effective manner, and properly accommodate the uncertainties in the data-driven postprocessing methods. A possible and desired outcome is a toolbox of nonintrusive software that wraps around aeroelastic CFD simulations. Included in the envisioned work and products are uncertainty quantification- (UQ-) based postprocessing tools that would serve to guide an analysis team to characterize flutter onset (among other aeroelastic phenomena) in a nondeterministic manner. Phase I demonstrations of the UQ methodologies and tools on a single NASA-FUN3D flutter problem are desired. Phase II efforts would require more complete development of an automated and user-friendly toolbox. The awardees could then wrap the developed UQ tools around other CFD/aeroelastic solvers for commercialization. In summary, proposals are being solicited in the above three focused areas under this subtopic. Successful awardees in all three research areas should note that it is NASA's intention to use developed software tools with NASA's CFD solvers.

Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,A1.06Vertical Lift Technology and Urban Air Mobility, GRC," AFRC, ARC, LaRC", 2021,Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) Electric Propulsion Safety and Reliability,"The expanding Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicle industry has generated a significant level of enthusiasm among aviation designers and manufacturers, resulting in numerous vehicle configurations. The majority of the prototype UAM vehicles have more than 4 rotors or propellers, have electric propulsion, carry 2 to 6 passengers, fly more like a helicopter (vertical takeoff and landing) than a fixed-wing aircraft and will fly relatively close to the ground and near buildings. There are many technical challenges facing industry‘s development of safe, quiet, reliable, affordable, comfortable, and certifiable UAM vehicles and vehicle operations. One of those challenges is the subject of this SBIR subtopic, namely, safety and reliability of the electric power system and electric powertrain for these UAM /eVTOL vehicles.This solicitation is seeking advancements in technologies that will improve the safety and reliability of the electrical power system/powertrain of UAM vehicles. There are three areas of main interest for this solicitation focused on the safety and reliability of the electrical power/powertrain system: (1) prognostic and diagnostic technologies for electric motors, (2) fault protection of high-voltage power system, and (3) advancements in thermal management technologies for electric motor systems. Based on industrial motor research and field data, use of continuous monitoring of conditions, such as temperature and vibration, can reduce the failure rate of motors by about two-thirds [Ref. 1]. This conclusion is based on data from large motors, but the physics of aviation motor degradation may be similar and future service experience may produce a similar overall trend. Due to the power levels envisioned for UAM vehicles, most will require high voltage (>540 V) operation, with the corresponding high-voltage direct current (DC) protection devices to ensure safe systems [Ref. 2]. Advancements in thermal management technologies, noted below, are also of interest given that temperature influences the overall safety and reliability of the power/powertrain system.The application of the requested technologies should be relevant to the NASA Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology (RVLT) project’s reference concept vehicles [Refs. 3-4], which embody the key vehicle characteristics of the UAM vehicle configurations being designed throughout industry. Technologies proposed for this solicitation should be relevant to 100 kW class motor-rotor powertrain elements with scalability in the 20 to 500 kW class.Through this solicitation, NASA is seeking advanced technologies supporting UAM electric/hybrid-electric propulsion in the areas of:Prognostic/diagnostic technologies:Operational performance diagnostics and prognostics technologies for electric motors and motor controllers to improve life and reliability of the system and reduce unscheduled maintenance for improved affordability. Technologies of interest related to motors/motor controllers include novel sensor and/or sensing technologies, data analysis algorithms, and methods to classify, fuse, or otherwise combine multiple sources of information for diagnostics, prognostics, and remaining useful life assessments. Proposers should consider the anticipated vehicle usage that will require differing motor power requirements for different phases of likely UAM flight profiles and maneuvers (power transients). The proposers should quantify any additional mass and/or power required (for example, mass of any additional sensors and associated cabling). Solutions that add minimal or no extra mass are of higher value and interest. The topic scope for the operational performance diagnostics and prognostics technologies is limited to the powertrain, motor controllers, and associated supporting systems for lubrication and cooling. The scope does not include batteries, fuel cells, fuel burning engines, avionics, communications equipment, or airframe structures. High-voltage protection devices:The high voltages expected in these systems will require properly rated protection devices. These do not currently exist for aeronautics-rated applications. While DC and alternating current (AC) architectures are both under consideration by designers, the focus here is on DC systems as these are the first being investigated by NASA. For this call, advanced technology high-voltage protection devices proposed should be applicable for systems with these characteristics: Voltage of 540 to 1,000 V, 100 to 200 A continuous operation with <5 msec clearing time. Other aspects of interest are current-limiting capability, high efficiency, and high reliability.Thermal management technologies: Lightweight, durable, and efficient thermal management solutions for 100 kW continuous-class electric motors are sought. Preferable are solution technologies that could be scaled and applied to aviation motors in a continuous power range of 20 to 500 kW. The most prevalent motor topology proposed and studied for this application are the permanent magnet motor family. Both passive and active approaches for thermal management may be applicable. Examples of technologies sought include integrated channels in rotor components, integrated heat pipes, and solutions enabled by additive manufacturing. Intended outcomes are effective and invasive solutions for motor rotors and windings with minimal mass and efficiency penalty. Solutions that demonstrate an improvement in reliability of the cooling system will be given extra consideration. Proposals should address the continuous motor specific power enabled by the innovations and the associated mass and efficiency penalties.",2 to 4,"Level 1: TX 01 Propulsion Systems

Prototype","Phase I of the SBIR should develop design concepts for specific technology advancements that address safety and reliability supported by analytical studies including modeling and simulation. Phase I effort should establish Phase II goals and should quantify projections of improvements to safety, reliability, and unscheduled maintenance assuming success of Phase II goals.Phase II of the SBIR should further develop the designs and validate achievement of goals through additional analysis, modeling, and simulation and through system/component functionality experiments. Phase II incorporates experiments with aircraft relevant hardware available commercially or through partnership with an aircraft component supplier and modified with innovative technology from this SBIR effort.","There are over 200 UAM vehicle concepts in varying stages of development. The immediate focus of the vehicle developers is overcoming obstacles on the path to certification. The public has experience flying in large transport aircraft and regional fixed-wing aircraft and are calibrated to associated safety levels for commercial air transportation. Detailed certification requirements for UAM vehicles are still under development by the relevant certifying authorities. For UAM aircraft, research is needed that addresses safety and reliability expectations of the traveling public and certifying authorities.","This subtopic is relevant to the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology (RVLT) Project under the Advanced Air Vehicle Program. The goal of the RVLT Project is to develop and validate tools, technologies, and concepts to overcome key barriers for vertical lift vehicles. The project scope encompasses technologies that address noise, speed, mobility, payload, efficiency, environment, and safety for both conventional and nonconventional vertical lift configurations. This subtopic directly aligns with the mission goals and scope in addressing safety and reliability of nonconventional vertical lift configurations.","

Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,A1.07Electric Power Generation Via Thermionic Conversion for Hypersonic Applications, LaRC, GRC, 2021,Thermionic Energy Harvetsing,"When employing a nonrotating propulsive device (engine), conventional generators for electrical power are not generally a viable design option; therefore, an alternative option is to utilize direct thermal-to-electric power conversion methods. One such technique is thermionic energy extraction applied to the primary flow path. Thermionic devices have been shown to be efficient in exploiting extreme temperature differentials, like those that typically characterize hypersonic flight environments, and also have a higher/larger energy density than that of standard batteries. The applications of thermionic devices in hypersonic vehicles are numerous, and broaden the design space, since 10 to 100 kW/m2 of electrical power are compatible with realistic hardware implementation strategies. Significant, prior efforts in the 1960s, by both the U.S. and Soviet Union, were explored for space applications, but hypersonic atmospheric applications have not been extensively investigated.For hypersonic atmospheric applications, the operational environments, relevant to the thermionic conversion process, are characterized by free-stream flight trajectories having dynamic pressures bounded by 750 to 3,500 (lbf/ft)/ft, and internal-flow path, peak static temperatures associated with adiabatic-flame temperatures (of a combusting hydrocarbon/air stoichiometric mixture). Additionally, volumetric and weight constraints of a novel thermionic device need to be competitive, and/or exceed, existing state-of-the-art battery technology in order to create viable design alternatives for system-design exploration. Although U.S. governmental restrictions typically apply to hypersonic-flight systems, this is not deemed to be a limiting factor in this Phase I activity, due to the low TRL; however, this issue will need to be further addressed during a Phase II award cycle, via coordination with appropriate U.S. governmental and industrial entities.",1 to 3,"Level 1: TX 03 Aerospace Power and Energy Storage

Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,A1.08Aeronautics Ground Test and Measurement Technologies, LaRC," ARC, GRC", 2021,Boundary Layer Velocity Profile Measurement On Models in Wind Tunnels,"NASA's aeroscience ground test facilities include wind tunnels, air-breathing engine test facilities, and simulation and loads laboratories. They play an integral role in the design, development, evaluation, and analysis of advanced aerospace technologies and vehicles. These facilities provide critical data and fundamental insight required to understand complex phenomena and support the advancement of computational tools for modeling and simulation. The primary objective of the Aeronautics Ground Test and Measurements Technologies subtopic is to develop innovative tools and technologies that can be applied in NASA’s aeroscience ground test facilities to revolutionize testing and measurement capabilities and improve utilization and efficiency. Of primary interest are technologies which can be applied to NASA’s portfolio of large-scale ground test facilities.Spatially and temporally resolved velocity measurements are sought to study boundary layers on test articles in NASA’s large-scale ground test facilities. Proposed measurement capabilities could be used to measure boundary layer thickness, velocity profiles, and transition from laminar to turbulent flow, as well as detecting flow separation that could potentially be used for flow control. Measurement systems should be reliable and robust enough to be implemented in various wind tunnel facilities such as the National TransonicFacility, the 11-Foot Transonic Unitary Plan Facility, the Transonic Dynamics Tunnel, and 8- by 6-Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel. These facilities operate using a variety of media, including air, nitrogen, and other gases such as R134a.Technology for measuring boundary layers on models in cryogenic wind tunnels is relatively undeveloped so innovative techniques which can operate at cryogenic conditions are especially of interest. In one potential application in a transonic cryogenic wind tunnel, the boundary layer thickness can be as small as 0.1 mm (e.g., on a wing) but could be as large as 10 mm (e.g., on a fuselage). In this same application, the flow velocity could range from -50 to 200 m/sec. While light projection and remote detection capabilities will be considered, fiber optic light delivery could be advantageous, particularly if the fiber optic transmission could utilize an existing pressure tap (or multiple taps) in the wind tunnel model. Scattering from light transmitted by a fiber optic embedded in the model could be detected by a remote, high magnification detection system or locally on the model (though that would result in additional cost to modify the wind tunnel model, which is less attractive).Discrete sensor systems could be proposed that both transmit and collect light from a single location. Considerations for selection include the following: the ability to measure at multiple spatial locations, with higher spatial resolution, with higher temporal resolution, over a wider range of conditions, with higher accuracy and higher precision, and probes with potential for measuring multiple parameters (multiple velocity components or temperature, density, or other). Molecular- and particle-based approaches will also be considered. Such a sensor may have medical or industrial applications. Plans for device calibration and risk mitigation should be provided. Expected accuracy, precision, and spatial and temporal resolution should be estimated.",2 to 5,"Level 1: TX 13 Ground, Test, and Surface Systems

Research","Phase I: The desired deliverable would be a detailed system design for measuring thin boundary layers on model surfaces in both air and cryogenic conditions. This concept or system design should preferably be verified by simulation or testing and capable of being developed into a prototype system as part of a Phase II effort.Phase II: Desired deliverables include a prototype system to measure boundary layers on a representative aerodynamic surface at room and cryogenic temperatures, a robust process for calibrating the system, and well-documented results from functional/operation tests including quantified uncertainty. It is anticipated that the technology would be demonstrated in a NASA ground-based test facility as part of the Phase II effort or shortly thereafter under Phase III funding.","As NASA continues in the quest to advance computational methods and predictive tools as part of CFD 2030, one of the nemeses to significant advancement and validation is the lack of velocity information in the boundary layer. At both low and high speeds, making this measurement requires probe-based systems to be positioned close to the surface or optical-based systems to be focused near the surface. This is quite challenging due to (1) the thickness of the boundary layer, which can be as small as 0.1 mm, (2) conditions on the surface of the test article, (3) vibration of the test article, and (4) drastic temperature changes in the wind tunnel, which can range from room temperature to as low as -200 °C at cryogenic temperatures. There is currently no measurement system available to measure thin boundary layers, especially at cryogenic conditions, and NASA’s inability to obtain this critical data in ground-based facilities at near-flight Reynolds numbers limits the validation of numerical simulations and predictive tools for use in design and certification by analysis. The proposed technology could possibly have application on flight vehicles and in the medical field as well.","The Transformational Tools and Technologies Project would use this technology to provide critical data to validate computational tools at near-flight Reynolds numbers as it pursues technical challenges to realize the CFD 2030 Vision and enable new aerospace vehicles to be certified by analysis. The technology would also have application for tests supporting the Advanced Air Transport Technology Project, the Commercial Supersonic Technology Project, the Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology Project, and the Aerosciences Evaluation and Test Capabilities (AETC) Portfolio.","

Focus Area 18 Air Vehicle Technology,A1.09Vehicle Sensor Systems to Enable Situational Awareness, GRC," AFRC, ARC, LaRC", 2021,Technologies to Enable Situational Awareness for Autonomous as well as Increasingly Autonomous Air Vehicles,"Achieving a vision for a safer and more efficient National Airspace System (NAS) with increasing traffic and the introduction of new vehicle types and unpiloted vehicles requires increasingly intelligent vehicle systems able to respond to complex and changing environments in a resilient and trustworthy manner. Future air vehicles, especially autonomous vehicles and those that support Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), must operate with a high degree of awareness of their own well-being, and possess the integrated intelligence to efficiently conduct operations while providing warning of off-nominal states. A vehicle’s capability to independently assure safety may be the only recourse in some situations, and for piloted vehicles addresses the recurring issue of inappropriate crew response. Internal to the vehicle, predictive maintenance reduces maintenance cost and vehicle down time through improved vehicle availability and throughput. Understanding the vehicle state also has impact on vehicle performance, efficiency, and environmental impact. External to the vehicle, vehicle awareness of the environment and ability to detect potential hazards in the surrounding airspace is crucial to the overall safety of the NAS and a vehicle’s ability to meet flight objectives.This subtopic seeks technologies to enable intelligent vehicle systems, including subsystem and avoidance technologies, with an internal and external situational awareness to assure safety; optimize mission completion, efficiency and performance in nominal conditions; and respond to off-nominal conditions. The emphasis is on piloted vehicles augmented with autonomous capabilities, as well as increasingly autonomous unmanned air vehicles (including AAM). This subtopic includes vertical lift vehicles in general, but excludes sensor systems specifically designed for monitoring powertrain health; such proposals should propose to A1.06. Vertical Lift Technology and Urban Air Mobility. Situational awareness of new or alternate vehicle configurations, including distributed and hybrid electric propulsion, are also of interest. Areas of interest include:Sensing and perception technologies that provide the ability of the vehicle to detect and extract internal and external vehicle information. Information fusion technologies to integrate information from multiple, disparate sources and evaluate that information to determine health and operational state. Onboard hardware and software systems that are modular, scalable, redundant, high reliability, and secure with minimal vehicle impact. Diagnostic technologies that provide critical markers trending to unsafe state. Networked sensors and algorithms to provide necessary vehicle full-field state information ranging from the component level to the subsystem and system level. Integrated systems technologies that enable the diagnosis of multiple hazards, while effectively dealing with uncertainties and unexpected conditions. Approaches that enable improved in-flight vehicle state safety awareness with adaptive methods to achieve improved efficiency, performance, and reduced environmental impact. Methods that significantly enhance the fidelity and relevance of information provided to ground systems by the vehicle in-flight for use in on-demand maintenance. Perception software capabilities including multispectrum sensor fusion, real-time perception system assurance software, and wake detection. Low-SWaP-C (size, weight, power, and cost) detection hardware that can detect objects at far distances, e.g., 1,500 ft to 3 nmi, including visual cameras, infrared (IR)cameras, event cameras, gated camera, Lidar, radar, and sonic hardware.

There should be evidence of efforts taken to infuse the technology into applications or a clear written plan for near term infusion of the technology. This may be part of the final report. Resulting products can include hardware, software, demonstrations, reports, products, components, and integrated systems.","It is predominately left to pilots (not the vehicle) to interpret current state and infer future states based on experience and expertise. Commercial Aviation Software Team (CAST), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and the National Research Council (NRC) have called for research on systems that can predict the state of the aircraft, including the state of autonomous systems, to provide notifications of trending to unsafe states. In order for there to be trust in autonomy, vehicle situational awareness needs to be tailored for independent autonomous systems without human intervention. Significant new capabilities are needed to enable safe vehicle operation in the airspace independent of human intervention. Sensing systems as intended here not only include the sensing element itself, but may also include the supporting technologies necessary to provide a meaningful measurement. Such supporting include hardware (e.g., networking capability) but also software (e.g., sensor fusion).There has been development in internal vehicle component health management technology with some adoption; integrated subsystem/vehicle system full-field health management is limited and do not presently enable a completely autonomous vehicle system. Further, measurement and monitoring technologies need to be adapted with the introduction of new vehicle types to provide information relevant to understanding the specific vehicle state. The objective is to provide sufficient, dependable information with limited vehicle impact to enable, e.g., time appropriate cognition and decision making. [For Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) vehicles, proposals involving such cognition and decision making can be submitted to Subtopic A2.02. Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Technologies.]Relevant to AAM, current exterior perception technologies are focused on specific domains that are not relevant to AAM. AAM applications fly faster and in a less cluttered environment than automobiles. Nominal operations are expected to be at speeds between 40 and 200 mph and altitudes below 5,000 ft over a range under a few hundred miles. They also fly at a lower altitude than commercial airlines, making them more susceptible to weather conditions, while resulting in a more obstacle-rich environment. Most perception systems and software are currently focused on the auto industry where required ranges are shorter and update rates need to be faster, or they are designed for extremely low SWaP unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that do not have passenger carrying safety requirements. Known gaps include the following: maintaining an aviation-grade safety assurance of perception systems, reaching the required detection distances, detection of objects in low-contrast/degraded environments, and detection and knowledge of hyperlocal weather phenomena.","This technology development is directly relevant to the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) Thrust 6 Autonomy Roadmap in order to allow more intelligent vehicle systems, and has strong relevance to NASA autonomy activities. NASA also plans to have an increasing role in the expanding market of AAM. Autonomy applications will only be able to make decisions as good as the information and insight at hand. The approach is to mature technology through this subtopic for ongoing implementation into NASA missions and commercial applications. This subtopic will also help define the limits of commercially available technology to meet the needs of increasingly intelligent systems to operate autonomously and in new transportation paradigms.Autonomy is also a core capability increasingly relevant across a range of NASA mission directorates. For Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), autonomy is central to planetary exploration and Earth monitoring, enabling more capable missions that provide improved science without the burden of human intervention. For example, the capability of an autonomous probe to maintain operations in uncertain or unforeseen conditions without human intervention can be critical to the success of the mission. Vehicle situational awareness may be mandatory in remote missions where it is difficult for a human to be in the loop in a timely manner. Likewise, the safety of the astronauts in a manned mission may depend on appropriate vehicle response to rapidly changing conditions.","

The documentation includes a set of Strategic Thrusts that are research areas that NASA will invest in and guide. It encompasses a broad range of technologies to meet future needs of the aviation community, the Nation, and the world for safe, efficient, flexible, and environmentally sustainable air transportation. Furthermore, the convergence of various technologies will also enable highly integrated electric air vehicles to be operated in domestic or international airspace. In response to the recently updated Strategic Thrust #4 (Safe, Quiet, and Affordable Vertical Lift Air Vehicles), a new subtopic titled “Full-Scale (2+ Passenger) Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) Scaling, Performance, Aerodynamics, and Acoustics Investigations” is being introduced.Proposals are sought in the following areas: (1) design and execution of experiments to gather research-quality data to validate aerodynamic and acoustic modeling of full-scale, multirotor eVTOL aircraft, with an emphasis on rotor-rotor interactions and (2) development and validation of scaling methods for extending and applying the results of instrumented subscale model testing to full-scale applications.

Focus Area 19 Integrated Flight Systems,A2.02Enabling Aircraft Autonomy, AFRC," ARC, GRC, LaRC", 2021,Enabling Aircraft Autonomy,"The increased use of automation on aircraft offers significant advantages over traditional manned aircraft for applications that are dangerous to humans, long in duration, and require a fast response and high degree of precision. Some examples include remote sensing, disaster response, delivery of goods, industrial inspection, and agricultural support. Advanced autonomous functions in aircraft can enable more capability and promises greater economic and operational advantages. Some of these advantages include a higher degree of resilience to off-nominal conditions, the ability to adapt to dynamic situations and less reliance on humans during operations.There are many barriers that are restricting greater use and application of autonomy in air vehicles. These barriers include, but are not limited to, the lack of methods, architectures, and tools that enable:Cognition and multi-objective decision making. Cost-effective, resilient, and self-organizing communications. Prognostics, survivability, and fault tolerance. Verification and validation technology and certification approaches.NASA and the aviation industry are involved in research that would greatly benefit from breakthroughs in autonomous capabilities that could eventually enable the Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). A few of the areas of research and missions are listed below:Remote missions utilizing one or more unmanned aircraft system (UAS) would benefit from autonomous planning algorithms that can coordinate and execute a mission with minimal human oversight Detect and avoid algorithms, sensor fusion techniques, robust trajectory planners and contingency management systems that can enable AAM and higher levels of UAS integration into the national airspace Fault detection, diagnostics, and prognostics capabilities to inform autonomous contingency management systems.This solicitation is intended to break through these and other barriers with innovative and high-risk research.The Integrated Aviation Systems Program's FY2021 SBIR solicitation is focused on tackling these barriers to enable greater use of autonomy in NASA research, in civil aviation use, and, ultimately, in the emerging AAM market. The following four research areas are the primary focus of this solicitation, and any submissions must show a strong relevance to these areas to be considered. The primary research areas are:Cognition and multi-objective decision making—Technologies need to be developed that transform the raw data into actionable information and make decisions based on this information. Detect and avoid in the national airspace utilizing multiple sensors is an example of one challenge this particular research is attempting to address. Artificial intelligence-based methods such as machine learning will be considered if it provides a novel approach. Cost-effective, resilient, and self-organizing communications—Methods that ensure reliable, trusted-source communications with increasingly complex and interconnected systems are needed to minimize the impact of infrastructure outages (e.g., Global Positioning System (GPS) or ground station) and that are resilient against both internal and external cyberphysical attacks. Several key areas of interest are: Resilient Position Navigation and Timing (RPNT) approaches for Global Navigation Satellite Systems- (GNSS-) denied or GPS-denied/degraded environments. Resilient wireless communications in the presence of jamming, terrain, or weather caused interference. Mesh/self-organizing networks. Quantum communication technologies, in particular, quantum repeaters and quantum key distribution methods. Prognostics, survivability, and fault tolerance—Techniques that can understand vehicle health, critical failures, can anticipate failures, and autonomously replan or execute emergency landings safely. Prognostics technologies capable of providing accurate predictions in a computationally constrained environment, such as that expected for small vehicles. Examples include, but are not limited to, new, efficient approaches and algorithms and hybrid edge/cloud approaches. Verification and validation technology and certification approaches—New methods of verification, validation, and certification need to be developed which enable application of complex systems to be certified for use in the National Airspace System (NAS). Proposed research could include novel hardware and/or software architectures that enable alternate or expedite traditional verification and validation requirements. Proposals should reference material on emerging standards for autonomy certification, including ASTM autonomy guidelines and emerging Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) considerations for small aircraft, UAS, and Urban Air Mobility (UAM).It is important to note that any proposals for UAS development will not be considered unless it can demonstrate strong relevance to aforementioned research interests.",3 to 6,"Level 1: TX 10 Autonomous Systems

Focus Area 19 Integrated Flight Systems,A2.03Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Integration, HQ, LaRC, 2021,AAM Community Integration - Weather Infrastructure Testbed,"AAM is a concept for safe, sustainable, affordable, and accessible aviation for transformational local and intraregional missions. AAM includes many potential mission types (e.g., passenger transport, aerial work, and cargo transport) that may be accomplished with many different aircraft types (e.g., manned and unmanned; conventional, short, and/or vertical takeoff and landing; all electric and hybrid electric; etc.) and are envisioned to bring aviation into people’s daily lives. Although passenger-carrying urban air mobility (UAM) is an AAM mission with much investment, other AAM missions, including but not limited to “thin haul”/regional air mobility, small package delivery, and medical transport, are also of interest. Responses to this subtopic are not limited to strictly any single AAM mission.Although limited manned, passenger-carrying UAM and other air taxi operations occur today, this market is ripe to expand as technologies such as electric propulsion and increasing autonomy converge enabling novel aircraft with enhanced capabilities. With time, the small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) market and manned UAM and air taxi markets may converge into a broader AAM market including both manned and unmanned vehicles. To start down the path to enabling this, ARMD has proposed an organizational framework, identified a set of barriers organized according to this framework that must be overcome to enable this market, and has identified NASA’s potential contributions to overcome these market impeding barriers.The AAM framework consists of five pillars: (1) aircraft design, (2) individual aircraft operations, (3) airspace design, (4) airspace and fleet operations, and (5) community integration. This solicitation focuses specifically on the community integration pillar (Refs 1-3, 6-8). Proposers seeking funding for aircraft design and individual aircraft operations should submit to vehicle technology subtopic in A1 and proposers seeking airspace design and operations funding should submit to the A3 topic.Scope 1 Weather Data Infrastructure Testbed—Weather data sensors are part of the weather infrastructure proposed in the UAM Maturity Level 4 (UML-4) ecosystem ConOps (concept of operations) (Refs 4 and 8).These sensors provide current weather conditions. The data they collect is an input into the UAM system for use by vehicle and vertiport operators and Providers of Services/UTM Supplemental Service Providers (PSUs/USSes) (Ref 6) and will also be utilized to validate forecasting models. This testbed should consider the innovative use of existing and new, fixed and mobile, and nontraditional weather sensors as part of the architecture; testing and validation of the accuracy of the sensors and data; new weather forecast techniques and/or ultrahigh spatial and temporal resolution weather forecast models tailored for UAM; and/or the assimilation of weather data from these sensors into weather models. The effort should consider the work being done by ASTM’s F38 WK73142 (Ref 5) and work towards a goal of increasing measurement density and scalability while incentivizing private sector companies to install weather sensing equipment, data delivery, and receive payment for the data by local government(s) and commercial Weather Supplemental Data Service Providers (SDSP) to improve UML-4 weather situational awareness and predictions. Phase I would also identify potential localities interested in hosting and utilizing the data from this testbed. Phase II would be to build the testbed in at least one locality and market for additional customers beyond those identified in Phase I.",2 to 4,"Level 1: TX 11 Software, Modeling, Simulation, and Information Processing

Such future concepts propose a seamless, integrated, flexible, and robust set of systems that are anticipated to include traditional as well as nontraditional vehicle types and operations, diverse airspace domains and mission types, and a service-based architecture to provide user services as those demonstrated within NASA's Unmanned Aircraft Systems Traffic Management (UTM) Project, as appropriate.

Focus Area 20 Airspace Operations and Safety,A3.03Future Aviation Systems Safety, ARC, LaRC, 2021,Future Aviation Systems Safety,"Public benefits derived from continued growth in the transport of passengers and cargo are dependent on the improvement of the intrinsic safety attributes of the Nation’s and the world’s current and future air transportation system. Recent developments to address increasing demand include: increased use of automation and autonomy to enhance system capabilities, airspace systems with tightly coupled air and ground functions, cloud computing-based technologies used to perform functions or services, other widely distributed functions across ground, air, and space environments, increasingly integrated aircraft systems, and novel vehicles and mission types, such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). These revolutionary changes are leading to greater system complexity, and current methods of ensuring that airspace and vehicle designs meet desired safety levels will likely not scale to these levels of complexity (Aeronautics R&D Plan, p. 30). The Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP) is addressing this challenge with a major area of focus on In-Time System-Wide Safety Assurance (ISSA). Understanding and predicting system-wide safety concerns of the airspace system and the vehicles flying in it, as envisioned in future aviation systems, is paramount. Thus, a proactive approach to managing system safety requires that once a new system, technology, procedure, or training is introduced, that operators have: (1) the ability to monitor the system continuously and to extract and fuse information from diverse data sources to identify emergent anomalous behaviors through health monitoring of system-wide functions; and (2) the ability to reliably predict probabilities of the occurrence of hazardous events and of their safety risks. Specifically, AOSP's System-Wide Safety (SWS) Project is developing an In-Time Aviation Safety Management System (IASMS), to address aviation system safety needs. Based on ISSA building blocks, its functional capabilities are architecturally structured to “Monitor—Assess—Mitigate” operational safety risks. One application area of high interest is monitoring, assessing, and mitigating cybersecurity vulnerabilities and attacks. Innovative approaches and methods are sought that monitor/assess/mitigate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors. Proposed innovations are sought that can be easily incorporated into the IASMS. Proposals that lack a technology/function that can be integrated into IASMS will be rejected.Specifically, this subtopic seeks the following types of proposals, whose technologies can be integrated into IASMS:Proposals to address the safety-critical risks identified in beyond visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) operations in small and large UAS, including but not limited to risks such as:Flight outside of approved airspace. Unsafe proximity to people/property. Critical system failure [including loss of command and control (C2) link, loss or degraded Global Positioning System (GPS), loss of power, and engine failure]. Loss-of-control (i.e., outside the envelope or flight control system failure). Any potential cybersecurity or cyber-physical attack affecting any or all operations within the UAS airspace system.Proposals supporting the research and development of ISSA objectives:To detect and identify system-wide safety anomalies, precursors, and margins. To develop the safety-data-focused architecture, data exchange model, and data collection mechanisms. To enable simulations to investigate flight risk in attitude and energy aircraft state awareness.Proposals supporting safety prognostic decision support tools, automation, techniques, strategies, and protocols:To support real-time safety assurance (including in-time monitoring of safety requirements). That consider operational context, as well as operator state, traits, and intent. For integrated prevention, mitigation, and recovery plans with information uncertainty and system dynamics in a UAS and trajectory-based operations (TBO) environment.

NASA’s research to enable unmanned vehicles to be safely and fully integrated into existing airspace structures (or lack thereof) has already demonstrated the potential benefits and capabilities of a service-based architecture [such as developed for the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Traffic Management (UTM) Research and Development (R&D) evaluations], and has led to new procedures, equipage and operating requirements, and policy recommendations, to enable widespread, harmonized, and equitable execution of diverse unmanned missions. This subtopic seeks proposals to continue to adapt the UTM concept elements for application to Urban Air Mobility (UAM)/Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), including:Service-based architecture designs that enable dense and/or increasingly complex UAM operations.Dynamic route planning that considers changing environmental conditions, vehicle performance and endurance, and airspace congestion and traffic avoidance. Dynamic scheduling for on-demand access to constrained resources and interaction between vehicles with starkly different performance and control characteristics.

Operational concepts for fleet and network management, market need and growth potential for future operations, and airspace integration. Identification of potential certification approaches for new vehicles operations (such as electric vertical takeoff and landing).Future service-based architectures also require resiliency to cyberattacks to ensure safe and robust operations that maintain expected levels of safety, as well as accommodating changes to environmental and operational conditions.

Analysis","For a traditional solar sail, the anticipated final product would be a prototype-tested control solution with potential to enable high performance for long-duration (>10-year) missions. For Phase I, the final deliverable must include very clear Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) of the control system approach based on preliminary proof-of-concept testing and/or analysis. The proposal must indicate anticipated KPPs for system-level implementation for a known design reference mission (e.g., Solar Polar Imager). The Phase II product must contain hardware development with laboratory performance testing to validate anticipated KPPs.For an E-sail, the anticipated final product would be a high-fidelity modeling tool for performance assessment of solar sail control system performance. The Phase I product must include the identification and assessment of the key driving elements for total control system performance and control system performance uncertainty in addition to the approach to mitigate flight system performance uncertainty in the Phase II development. The Phase II product must include the delivery of a fully functional control system modeling tool suitable for high-fidelity performance assessment applied to missions of interest (e.g., Solar Polar Imager and Interstellar Probe).","State-of-the-art solar sail systems use translating masses (so-called AMT (Active Mass Translator)) and reflective control devices. Solar sail thrust, though miniscule in size, can produce large-velocity deltas over a multiyear mission. These small forces also create disturbance torques caused by misalignment in the center of mass (CM) and center of pressure (CP). NEAScout (current NASA Sail mission) estimates that the CP/CM offset is large enough to overload control systems and requires a mechanical system to adjust the CM and trim the spacecraft—the AMT. However, the scalability of the AMT to larger sail missions, such as the Interstellar Probe is currently unknown.Attitude can also be controlled by varying solar radiation pressure directly on the sail itself. So-called reflectivity control devices (RCDs) were demonstrated on JAXA's first solar sail mission, IKAROS, and are currently being investigated by NASA and academic partners. A typical RCD utilizes a polymer-dispersed liquid crystal whose optical properties can be adjusted via an applied electric voltage. These devices show promise, although challenges exist in yielding control in all three axes. Further, space environments survivability in extreme environments, especially the hot thermal of a high-inclination Solar Polar Imager, for example, also remains a challenge.E-sails have low-fidelity simulations for control systems. Multitethered bodies coupled with varying plasma environments throughout the mission profiles, spacecraft charging, tether dynamics, and the like, are critical gaps.","The resulting product should improve the performance or lower the subsystem mass for a solar-sail-based spacecraft optimized for the high-inclination Solar Polar Imager, advanced generation Solar Storm Warning systems, as well as the interstellar probe.","

Focus Area 21 Small Spacecraft Technologies,"T5.05Solar and Electric Sail Embedded Technologies for Communications, Control, or Ancillary Functions", MSFC," ARC, GRC, JPL", 2021,Lightweight Deployable (Solar Sail) Embedded Interplanetary Communication Solutions,"One of the challenges with higher performance solar sails remains to be a highly resilient yet low-resource and low-complexity control system. Traditional solar sail options under consideration have previously considered impulsive systems (chemical and electric), mechanical systems (translation tables, guy wires, and moving masses), reflective control devices, and advanced diffractive metafilms. Further electric solar wind sail (E-sail) control systems are lower maturity and require new modeling and analysis tools for higher fidelity performance assessment. This solicitation seeks either embedded sail control technologies for traditional solar sails or the development of advanced modeling capabilities for E-sail control systems.",3 to 5,"Level 1: TX 05 Communications, Navigation, and Orbital Debris Tracking and Characterization Systems
Level 2: TX 05.5 Revolutionary Communications Technologies","Prototype
Analysis",The anticipated Phase I product of this solicitation would be a proof-of-concept demonstration of the technology with determination of the Key Performance Parameters by test and/or analyses leading to a higher fidelity prototype(s) and relevant environmental demonstrations in Phase II.,"The current state of the art for SmallSat/CubeSat missions is led by ISARA (Integrated Solar Array and Reflectarray Antenna) flown on MarCO. Using a combination reflectarray and patch array, it demonstrated an 8-kbps X-band downlink from Mars orbit with a 28-dB-gain design in a small form factor of <1 kg and 272 cm3 at 5 W. For reference, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is a large spacecraft communicating from aproximately the same distance as MarCO with a 46.7-dB 3-m dish that varies from 500- to 4,000-kbps X-band downlink at 100 W.Outside of ISARA, various arrays of 16 patch antennas or fewer are available from places like Endurosat and Clyde Space with gains from 11.5 to 16 dB. Thin-film solutions such as the Lightweight Integrated Solar Array and anTenna (LISA-T) are in development. However, the ultimate scalability (mechanically, mass, stowage volume, etc.) is limited. Thus, a critical technology gap exists in higher data rate communication solutions for SmallSats outside Earth orbit. The current NASA Small Spacecraft Strategic Technology Plan states this need in several ways including large deployable apertures. This gap is especially critical for deployable solar sail missions such as interstellar probe and potentially for second- and third-generation space weather monitoring platforms. In short, low SWaP-C, high-gain communication techniques that will push small spacecraft data rates towards their larger spacecraft brothers and sisters are needed. To enhance future solar sail missions, these concepts should be amenable if not directly embedded onto the solar sail itself.","The SIMPLEX solicitation opportunities would benefit significantly from higher data rate communication solutions for SmallSat missions. Further specific solar sail mission such as the high-inclination Solar Polar Image mission and second- and third-generation space weather monitoring missions would be enhanced by this technology, and specific solar sail missions such as the interstellar probe would be enabled by this technology.","

Focus Area 21 Small Spacecraft Technologies,Z8.02Communications and Navigation for Distributed Small Spacecraft Beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO), GRC," ARC, GSFC, JPL", 2021,End-to-End Deep Space Communications,"Develop enabling communications technologies for small spacecraft beyond LEO. These technologies will be required by spacecraft to conduct NASA lunar and deep space distributed spacecraft science missions. Innovations in communications technologies for distributed small spacecraft are essential to fulfill the envisioned science missions within the decadal surveys and contribute to the success of human exploration missions. To construct the lunar communications architecture [Ref. 11], it is appropriate to consider a hybrid approach of large and small satellite assets. Primary applications include data relay from lunar surface to surface, data relay to Earth, and navigational aids to surface and orbiting users. Distributing these capabilities across multiple small satellites may be necessary because of limited size, weight, and power (SWaP), but also to enhance coverage.Technologies for specific lunar architecture are especially needed. For example, landers near the lunar South Pole may not have—and landers on the far side of the Moon will not have—direct line-of-sight to Earth-based ground stations and will need to send data through a relay satellite (or Gateway) to return data to Earth. Small surface systems (including rovers or astronauts on extravehicular activities (EVAs)) on the Moon will likely not have the necessary system resources to close a direct link to Earth. Human surface operations may require surface-to-surface over-the-horizon communications through an orbital relay. Deployment of sufficient traditional communications assets to maintain persistent global coverage of the lunar surface may be prohibitively expensive. Analogous to emerging LEO communications constellations, small spacecraft can operate as local relays in cislunar space.Considerations of extension of the technologies and capabilities to the martian domain and other deep space applications are also solicited.Interspacecraft networking is inherent to distributed mission and interoperable communications relay architectures. Enabling networking capabilities in small spacecraft requires low SWaP-C hardware for radio-frequency (RF) and optical cross links. While network protocols developed for interoperable communications relays may be interchangeable with those for distributed missions, relay networks may not be scalable to very large scale sensor webs of small spacecraft. As such, addressing interspacecraft networking gaps may require investment in both hardware cross links and networking protocols that scale to hundreds of nodes, and require robustness for loss of nodes or as new nodes enter the network.An end-to-end system needs to be considered for the application of small satellites for deep space missions as described in preceding paragraphs. Therefore, enabling technologies also include non-NASA ground services that keep the operations cost commensurate with the lower costs of the small satellites themselves. Automation of the ground services as well as the small satellite constellations are needed.Communications solutions can operate in optical or various RF bands; however, considerations must be given to bandwidth, public and Government licensing, and compatibility with referenced candidate architectures.",2 to 5,"Level 1: TX 17 Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GN&C)
Level 2: TX 17.2 Navigation Technologies","Prototype
Software
Hardware","Phase I: Identify and explore options for the deep space small-satellite missions, including ground services. Conduct trade analysis and simulations, define operating concepts, and provide justification for proposed multiple access techniques, frequency bands of operation, command and data handling, and networking solutions. Also identify, evaluate, and develop design for integrated communications payload(s) and one or more constituent technologies that enable distributed spacecraft operations in the relevant space environment beyond LEO. Integrated communications system solutions and constituent component deliverables should offer potential advantages over the state of the art, demonstrate technical feasibility, and show a path toward a hardware/software infusion into practice. Bench-level or laboratory-environment level demonstrations or simulations are desirable. The Phase I proposal should outline a path that shows how the technology can be developed into space-qualifiable and commercially available small-spacecraft communications payloads through Phase II efforts and beyond.Phase II: Demonstration of communication technology via prototype or high-fidelity emulation. The relevant deep space environment parameters should be simulated as much as possible.","Small-spacecraft missions beyond Earth require compact, low-power, high-bandwidth radios for use on the Moon, Mars, the rest of the inner planets, around asteroids or other small bodies, and at other deep space destinations. The current state of the art is the Iris radio (0.5U, 1.2 kg, and 35 W) [Ref. 12] that has been operationally used at Mars, and there is no known affordable, readily available competitor. Future missions require systems that are lower SWaP-C, can operate in multiple bands (S, X, Ka-band, and optical), and can reach uplink and downlink speeds in excess of 20 Mbps. Spectral, modulation, information layer, and protocol compatibility with current technologies (Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN)); licensing and spectrum approval; and planned Government or commercial deep space communication architecture must all be considered.Communications among spacecraft in a distributed spacecraft mission (DSM) configuration and between the DSM configuration and the Earth become more challenging beyond LEO distances. Collaborative configurations of widely distributed (10s to 100s of km apart) small spacecraft (180 kg or less) will operate far into the near-Earth region of space and beyond into deep space, further stressing the already limited communications capabilities of small spacecraft. Alternative operational approaches with associated enabling hardware and/or software will be needed with the following:Uplinks (Earth-to-space) and downlinks (space-to-Earth): Alternatives for coordinated command and control of the DSM configuration and individual small spacecraft from Earth as well as return of science and telemetry data to Earth. Each spacecraft cannot rely on its own dedicated Earth link, consuming valuable ground infrastructure and operators. Integrated communications payload: Hardware and software designs for the common and unique capabilities of each small spacecraft in the DSM configuration. Spacecraft communication SWaP-C should be reduced by at least 25% from a non-DSM spacecraft. Small-spacecraft antennas: Development of antennas optimized for either intersatellite or uplink/downlink communications are sought across a broad range of technologies including but not limited to deployable parabolic or planar arrays, active electronically steered arrays, novel antenna steering/positioning subsystems, and others suitable for use in high data rate transmission among small spacecraft over large distances. SWaP-C should be reduced from state of the art, such as the recent 6U CubeSat MarCO mission, which used a 0.2m2 X-band reflectarray to achieve 29 dBic gain and 42% efficiency [Refs. 13, 14]. Operations compatible with NASA’s space communications infrastructure [Ref. 9] and Government exclusive or Government/non-Government-shared frequency spectrum allocations is required [Refs. 6, 7, 8]. Compatibility and interoperability with lunar communications and navigation architecture plans [Refs. 1, 2, 3]. Application of the emerging lunar standards includes frequency allocations per link functionality, modulation, coding, and networking protocol standards. Ka-band frequencies and above are highly desired.","Several missions are being planned to conduct investigations/observations in the cislunar region and beyond. For example, Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS);Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment (CAPSTONE); human exploration (Artemis) landing site and resource surveys; lunar communications and navigation infrastructure, including LunaNet, Mars communications relay, etc. Commercial and NASA small spacecraft, lunar surface assets, and manned vehicles in cislunar space and beyond will multiply within the decade. All of these missions will depend on small-spacecraft communications relays, time reference transmissions, and navigation capabilities.","

Current space navigation technologies are not adequate when relative or absolute position knowledge of multiple spacecraft are involved. State of the art (SOA) for attitude is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's ASTERIA (Arcsecond Space Telescope Enabling Research in Astrophysics) 6U CubeSat demonstrated pointing stability of 0.5 arcsec (0.1 microdeg) rms over 20 min using guide stars. For position knowledge, missions still primarily use ranging transponders relying on a two-way Earth link. Examples of SOA for this ranging are the Iris transponder and the Small Deep Space Transponder (SDST) [Ref. 13].Global navigation satellite services like the United States' Global Positioning System (GPS) provide very limited services beyond Geostationary Earth Orbit distances, and no practical services in deep space. Autonomous navigation capabilities are fundamental to DSMs to ensure known topography of the configuration at the time of data acquisition. Control of the distributed configuration requires robust absolute and relative position knowledge of each spacecraft within the configuration and the ability to control spacecraft position and movement according to mission needs. Critical areas for advancement are:Long-term, high-accuracy attitude determination: In particular, low-SWaP absolute attitude determination using star trackers, etc., to achieve sub-arcsec accuracy. Optical navigation: Solutions are sought for visual-based systems that leverage advances in optical sensors (e.g., cameras, star trackers) to observe and track a target spacecraft and perform pose and relative position estimation. Opportunities for innovation include methods that do not require the execution of satellite maneuvers and/or the design of external satellite features that enhance observability. Innovations may be appropriate for only certain regimes, such as near, medium, or far range; however, this context should be described. Solutions for various lunar and deep space mission operations concepts are of interest. Other novel navigation methods: Stellar navigation aids, such as navigation via quasars, x-rays, and pulsars, may provide enabling capabilities in deep space. Surface-based navigation aids, such as systems detecting radio beacons or landmarks, are invited. Methods for autonomous position control are also of interest. Technologies that accomplish autonomous relative orbit control among the spacecraft are invited. Control may be accomplished as part of an integrated system that includes one or more of the measurement techniques described above. Of particular interest are autonomous control solutions that do not require operator commanding for individual spacecraft. That is, control solutions should accept as input swarm-level constraints and parameters and provide control for individual spacecraft. Opportunities for innovation include the application of optimization techniques that are feasible for small satellite platforms and do not assume particular orbit eccentricities. State-of-the art in this area is the Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment (CAPSTONE), the first spacecraft to attempt to navigate to and maintain a near-rectilinear halo orbit around the Moon as a precursor for Gateway [Ref. 11].NASA is also partnering with universities for use of surface-feature-based navigation and timing [Ref. 12].NOTE: Small-spacecraft propulsion technologies are not included in this subtopic.","Space communications and position knowledge and control are enabling capabilities required by spacecraft to conduct all NASA missions.

Focus Area 21 Small Spacecraft Technologies,Z8.08Technologies to Enable Cost and Schedule Reductions for Optical System for CubeSats, ARC," GSFC, JPL", 2021,Technologies to Enable Cost and Schedule Reductions for Optical System for CubeSats,"Concepts for optical systems are sought that will enable larger apertures or longer focal lengths than currently available systems, to be deployed from within small spacecraft. Relatively inexpensive small spacecraft offer several advantages over larger, more expensive spacecraft: small spacecraft can perform inspection and repair of larger spacecraft, several can be deployed for more frequent revisit rates over Earth's surface or planetary objects, and multiple craft can achieve affordable mission reliability through redundancy. To date, the utility of small spacecraft in missions involving remote sensing (in any spectral band) has been constrained by their low budget and compact size; optical sensitivity is limited in proportion to the diameter of a telescope's aperture, and magnification is limited by the effective focal length. The cost to produce one-of-a-kind optical assemblies is disproportionate and the production times too long to incorporate into the tight budgets and schedules typical of small-spacecraft missions.The objective of this subtopic is to receive proposals that articulate a demonstrable ability to manufacture, test, and control ultra-low-cost observing systems that can meet the reference mission performance requirements (including infrastructure issues) within a time frame and budget compatible with a small-spacecraft development cycle. For the purposes of this subtopic, small spacecraft are defined as CubeSats of 12U volume. Proposals are sought that willSpecify observing systems figures of merit for a potential small-spacecraft mission, for example: Earth resource management (commercial). Maritime traffic monitoring. Observations for agricultural industry. Fire, flood, or other emergency monitoring. Lunar exploration precursors or observation of human activity at the Moon. Remote spacecraft health inspection. Near-Earth object detection. In-space or lunar-to-Earth optical communications. Other reference mission to be specified by proposer. Include discussion of current state of the art for telescope optical parameters (sensitivity, resolution, and magnification within a spectral band). Include production cost and schedule significantly improved by the proposed system design.Significant areas for proposals are:Concept systems that are modular in nature that can be produced in quantities larger than the single-unit production typical of spaceflight hardware builds (for instance, batch or lot production yielding flight units in the quantity range of 30 to 50). Concepts that will enable large deployable apertures (optical and related, such as sun shades enabling larger apertures) and/or longer focal lengths than currently available systems that can be implemented from within a 12U small spacecraft. The concepts of large deployable optical apertures and focal lengths for small spacecraft address the fact that small spacecraft are inherently size constrained.Requirements to be addressed in the project should include specific needs for each wavelength application region, for example:For UV/Optical: Wavefront Figure <5 nm rms Wavefront Stability <1 nm/10 min First Mode Frequency >500 Hz Actuator Resolution <1 nm rms For EUV: Slope <0.1 microradAlso needed is ability to fully characterize surface errors and predict optical performance.",3 to 6,"Level 1: TX 12 Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems, and Manufacturing

A CubeSat-class precision optical system with an undeployed aperture constrained by a 0.2-m diameter (fits within a 12U volume). For Phase I, deliverables should include a design reference mission relevant to the optical system design, with key performance parameters identified. Identification of key relevant subcomponents of a telescope system that require a prototype demonstration for fabrication, test, or control technology required for a successful Phase II delivery of a prototype. Ideally, Phase I includes a reviewed preliminary design and manufacturing plan that demonstrates production feasibility, appropriate material behavior, process controls, and optical performance. Mounting/deploying issues, especially with consideration to small spacecraft, should be resolved and demonstrated. While final manufacturing and assembly will be conducted in Phase II, the preliminary design should address how optical, mechanical (static and dynamic), and thermal designs and performance analysis will be done to show compliance with proposed performance measures, survival of the launch environment, and performance in the space environment (Earth orbiting or deep space).In Phase II, the project could build a prototype and complete environmental qualification testing of the optical system (or a single node in the case of a multi-element system), including measuring optical figure before and after vibration testing, acoustic testing, and thermal cycling. It would also demonstrate that the telescope maintains optical figure in a reference thermal environment including thermal gradients.","Requirements to be addressed in the deliverables should include specific needs for each wavelength application region, for example:For UV/Optical: Wavefront Figure <5 nm rms Wavefront Stability <1 nm/10 min First Mode Frequency >500 Hz Actuator Resolution <1 nm rms For EUV: Slope <0.1 microradAlso needed is ability to fully characterize surface errors and predict optical performance.State of the Art and Critical Gaps:Technical ChallengesUltrastable, normal incidence mirrors with low mass-to-collecting area ratios, affordably produced and delivered, modular and readily integrated into CubeSat-class form-factor, are desired.Affordably Manufactured, Easily Integrated, Readily AvailableAfter performance, affordability is the most important metric for an advanced optical system, and long telescope fabrication times add significant program cost. Current normal incidence space telescopes in the 0.2- to 0.5-m aperture class have lead times of 12 to 18 months and cost $1 million to $5 million. This research effort seeks a 10× reduction in schedule and cost for precision optical components: a lead time of 4 to 6 months and a cost of $100K to $500K for a 0.2- to 0.5-m aperture-class telescope. Options should be offered for modular and easy installation into a CubeSat-style payload enclosure, with considerations for maximizing aperture sizes, reliable deployment (if required), and reliable optical alignment.Large Deployable Apertures for Small SpacecraftSmall spacecraft are inherently size constrained. Given the tight volume constraints of CubeSats and other small spacecraft, deployable systems for these platforms need to be highly volumetrically efficient and may employ novel configurations or deployment mechanisms relative to their larger brethren. Systems that can deploy a larger aperture then nominally available in a fixed system can address this constraint.Affordably Manufactured, Easily Integrated, Readily AvailableTo accomplish NASA CubeSat-class missions, the mirrors and even entire optical assemblies must be delivered on CubeSat-class schedules after they have been specified. Earth-observing missions and astronomical applications often involve assembling and testing one or many spacecraft within a matter of months from concept to delivery. Optics that can be quickly procured as ""catalog items"" upon specification must be fabricated and ready for installation—preferably as an assembled module including optics bench and mounting hardware ""plug and play"" ready—or risk not being available on time for the tight mission schedules.","A new class of low-cost, optically stable, wide-spectral-range telescopes designed specifically for small spacecraft have application in a variety of exploration, commercial, and science missions. Existing missions can be accomplished in novel and more affordable ways with small spacecraft, and new missions will be enabled by high-performance telescopes in small spacecraft. A few examples include:Earth resource management. Maritime traffic monitoring. Observations for agricultural industry from low Earth orbit. Satellite optical crosslinks or lunar satellite-to-Earth optical communications. Lunar exploration in situ resource utilization (ISRU) or landing site surveyors or manned surface mission operations observation. Remote spacecraft health inspection/monitoring. Near-Earth object detection or exoplanet transit detection in deep space.","

Focus Area 21 Small Spacecraft Technologies,Z8.09Small Spacecraft Transfer Stage Development, MSFC," AFRC, GRC", 2021,Small Spacecraft Transfer Stage Development,"NASA and industry represent prospective customers for sending small-spacecraft payloads in the near term to the cislunar environment, with longer term potential for farther destinations such as near-Earth objects, Mars, or Venus. The lunar destinations in this case include the lunar surface, with specific interest in the South Pole, low lunar and frozen lunar orbits, and cislunar space, including Earth-Moon LaGrange points (e.g., E-M L3) and the lunar Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) intended for Gateway. In future missions, NASA may transport small spacecraft to Venus for scientific discovery, to Mars to serve as precursors and infrastructure for human (and scientific) exploration, and on small-spacecraft missions to near-Earth objects for science measurements needed to understand prospective threats to Earth, and perhaps even for resource extraction and return to Earth. The ultimate goal is to exploit the advantages of low-cost and rapidly produced CubeSats and small spacecraft, defined as total mass less than 180 kg fueled, by enabling them to reach these locations. Due to the current limits of SmallSat propulsion capabilities and the constraints of rideshare opportunities, NASA has an interest in the development of a low-cost transfer stage to guide and propel small spacecraft on trajectories to the vicinity of the Moon, then enable their insertion into the above-referenced orbits with the transfer stage or within sufficient proximity to achieve and maintain final orbit under their own power. These same capabilities and others will later need to be extended for small spacecraft to explore nearby planets. Transfer stage architectures and designs shall be compatible with U.S. small launch vehicles that are currently flying or will be launching imminently. Proposals shall identify one or more relevant small launch vehicles, describe how their designs fit within the constraints of those vehicles, and define the transfer capability of the proposed system (i.e., from low Earth orbit (LEO), geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO), etc., to low lunar orbit (LLO), NHRO, E-M L3, etc.). Transfer stage designs shall contain all requisite systems for navigation, propulsion, and communication in order to complete the mission. Any and all propulsion chemistries and methods may be considered, including electric propulsion, as long as the design closes within the reference mission constraints. Transfer stages shall also include method(s) to deploy one or more SmallSat payloads into the target trajectory or orbit. Innovations such as novel dual-mode systems that enable new science missions or offer improvements to the efficiency, accuracy, and safety of lunar missions are of interest. Concepts that can demonstrate improvements in cost and reliability and those that reduce requirements (thermal, power, etc.) on the payload are also highly desired. This subtopic is targeting transfer stages for launch vehicles that have a capability range similar to that sought by the NASA Venture Class Launch Services. Rideshare applications that involve medium- or heavy-lift launch vehicles (e.g., Falcon 9, Atlas V) or deployment via the International Space Station (ISS) airlock are not part of this topic.Lunar design reference mission:Launch on a small launch vehicle (ground or air launch). Payload (deployable spacecraft) mass: at least 25 kg. Provide sufficient delta V and guidance to enter into Trans Lunar Injection (TLI) orbit after separation from small launch vehicle. An example mission is the Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment (CAPSTONE)/NRHO Pathfinder 12U (25 kg) CubeSat that requires a TLI orbit with a C3 of -0.6 km2/s2. (Alternative) Provide sufficient delta V and guidance to place a 25- to 50-kg spacecraft directly into lunar NHRO or E-M L3 orbit. Deploy spacecraft from transfer stage. Safe and disposal of transfer stage. A stretch goal is extensibility of the design for planetary design reference missions: Similar to the above, for Venus, Mars, or near-Earth object destinations.",4 to 6,"Level 1: TX 01 Propulsion Systems

Analysis","A Phase I effort should provide evidence in the feasibility of key elements of cost, assembly, integration, and operations through fabrication or testing demonstrations. A prototype system should reach a ""near CDR"" level during Phase I with a mapping of key performance parameters (mass, power, cost, etc.) from the prototype to the flight design, along with potential opportunities for technology demonstration and commercialization.It is highly desired that the Phase II deliverable include demonstration test of the prototype system along with detailed metrics (mass, power, cost, etc.) traceable to a flight design for the reference mission. Efforts leading to Phase II delivery of integrated prototype systems that could either be ground- or flight-tested as part of a post-Phase II effort are of particular interest.","Many CubeSat/SmallSat propulsion units are designed for low delta-V maneuvers such as orbit maintenance, stationkeeping, or reaction control. Larger delta-V systems are employed for larger satellites and science/exploration missions, but are often costly and integrated as part of the satellite design. Systems typically range from cold-gas to bipropellant storables with electric systems also viable for very small systems. Rocket Lab has recently introduced an upgraded version of their monopropellant kick stage, which includes a bipropellant engine, advanced attitude control, and power subsystems. This system will be used for the first time for NASA's CAPSTONE mission and is suggested to have capability for orbits beyond the lunar environment. At the component level, Aerojet Rocketdyne and Moog, Inc. are prominent suppliers of state-of-the-art (SOA) thrusters, including commonly used variants of the R-4D engine, while companies like Blue Canyon Technologies offer spacecraft bus solutions absent dedicated propulsion elements. Advanced manufacturing, electric pumps and actuators, nontoxic propellants, and electrospray thrusters all offer potential improvements in the flight capabilities of small propulsion systems. System concepts that enable improved spacecraft performance and control, such as dual-mode systems, provide potential advancements to the current SOA, especially those that enable new science missions and those that offer potential improvements to the efficiency, accuracy, and safety of future lunar manned missions. While many of these component technologies are reasonably mature, no integrated system capability has been developed and implemented specifically as a rapid, low-cost solution for translunar or cislunar mission designs.","This subtopic extends the capabilities of the Flight Opportunities Program and Launch Services Program by seeding potential providers to establish lunar/cislunar transfer capabilities. The Small Spacecraft Technology Program (SSTP) also seeks demonstrations of technical developments and capabilities of small spacecraft to serve as precursor missions (such as landing site investigation or in situ resource utilization (ISRU) prospecting) for human exploration, and as communications and navigation infrastructure for follow-on cislunar missions. SSTP CAPSTONE is an example mission.Many technologies appropriate for this topic area are also relevant to NASA's lunar exploration goals. Small stages developed in this topic area would also be potential flight testbeds for cryogenic management systems, wireless avionics, or advance guidance systems and sensors. Sound rocket capabilities are being improved with options financed through this topic.Small launch vehicles provide direct access for a small spacecraft to the destination or orbit of interest at a time of the small spacecraft mission’s choosing. In support of exploration, science, and technology demonstration missions, further expansion of these vehicle’s reach beyond LEO is needed. To expand the risk-tolerant small spacecraft approach to deep space missions, frequent and low-cost access to destinations of interest beyond Earth is required.In the longer term, technical capabilities of small spacecraft at Venus, Mars, or NEO destinations will be demonstrated by SSTP, and ultimately new kinds of transfer vehicles derived from these capabilities may be needed to propel them there.","

Focus Area 21 Small Spacecraft Technologies,Z8.10Wireless Communication for Avionics and Sensors for Space Applications, ARC," GRC, JPL, LaRC, MSFC", 2021,Modular and Flexible Wireless Avionics Architectures and Wireless Sensing and Integrated Avionics for Space Applications,"The Wireless Communication for Avionics and Sensors for Space Applicationssubtopic solicits proposals to develop enabling concepts, components, and subsystems based on innovative avionics architectures for small spacecraft. Of interest are wireless systems that demonstrate reliable data transfer across avionics components, subsystems, and interfaces to simplify system integration, reconfiguration, and testing. These can range from developmental and flight instrumentation systems used for qualification and diagnostics on large spacecraft to full-up wireless avionics for small spacecraft. Solutions that enable new avionic architectures and provide capabilities that expand mission performance while decreasing the size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) and cost of the resulting spacecraft are highly desirable. The goal of this effort is to mature wireless avionics technology that facilitates the reuse of components, subsystems, and software across multiple spacecraft and missions while reducing production and operating costs. Modularity is defined as utilizing a set of standardized parts or independent units to form a full avionics system, and flexibility allows adapting modular components across different configurations, missions, and design stages. For example, wireless subnets improve modularity by eliminating the physical data connections from each component, simplifying physical integration. The scope is intended to range from simple wireless sensors to complete avionics systems, including software incorporating functions compatible with common spacecraft components. This means being able to integrate a given component or entire subsystem into flight hardware and software using object-oriented frameworks, allowing components or functions to be added to a new or existing spacecraft design without requiring significant changes to the other nonrelated components or subsystems. This subtopic also solicits proposals to develop techniques, components, and systems that reduce or eliminate the dependency on wires, connectors, and penetrations for sensing and for the transmission of data and power across avionics subsystems, interfaces, and structures. Of interest are techniques that enable new applications through the use of innovative methods such as the use of flexible materials and additive manufacturing. For example, the use of additive manufacturing and 3D printing to embed avionics components such as antennas, sensors, transmission lines, and interface functions into a spacecraft structure during the design and manufacturing process can increase efficiency while maintaining structural integrity. Similarly, the use of thin and flexible materials to construct passive wireless sensors enables sensing systems for structures such as parachutes and inflatable spacecraft without breaching the pressure interface. Systems that are applicable to small spacecraft (typically 6U/12U/24U CubeSats, including ESPA-class (Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Secondary Payload Adapter)) but scalable to large vehicles can result in a significant reduction of risk for more complex and longer duration missions. Near-term missions include cislunar, lunar orbiting, lunar landed, and exploration precursor missions; low Earth orbit (LEO) “swarms” for Earth science and heliophysics; and disaggregated cooperative ensembles and sustained infrastructure for human exploration. New applications might include manned spacecraft inspection, repair, communications support, and related areas. Proposals that provide reliable performance in extreme environments and that show a path to a flight demonstration are preferable.The subtopic solicits developments in wireless avionics and wireless sensing for small spacecraft and may include technologies that:Improve the reliability and applicability of wireless avionics for small spacecraft with significant improvements in subsystem size, mass, and volume, particularly if the technology can simplify the spacecraft fabrication, test, and integration process. Allow innovative architectures for wireless avionics featuring plug-and-play software supporting modular subsystems that can be easily incorporated into specific small-satellite missions. Improve fault detection aboard spacecraft using wireless sensor systems to augment current wired sensors and which include the capability of adding sensors to address developmental and flight instrumentation use. Use innovative techniques for embedding sensors and other avionics components into a spacecraft to reduce or eliminate large and heavy cables and connectors, or that enable data transfer inside and across rotating mechanisms and pressure interfaces or into remote locations where it is difficult or unfeasible to run cables or where cables are at risk of failure. Use additive manufacturing of wireless components such as antennas, sensors, and processing elements to create new components that may be smaller and lighter than current products. These new components could possibly be embedded into materials and structures that enable in situ structural health management, contributing to the development of smart structures and materials. Include sensors and actuators that can be distributed among cooperative spacecraft to enable automated inspection of space assets or resource detection at the surface of the Moon, Mars, or other celestial bodies.Key performance parameters (KPPs) would include improvements of at least a factor of 2 over existing technology in size, mass, and power consumption for sensors and associated components for a wireless instrumentation system. Improvements of sensor network throughput greater than 5× the current 2-Mbps performance is desired, along with reduction of latency and incorporation of timing information.",3 to 6,"Level 1: TX 02 Flight Computing and Avionics

Demonstration of specific new mission capabilities. Delivery of prototype hardware for NASA evaluation.","Development of small satellites missions benefit from a growing number of users worldwide. This means there may be a large pool of COTS components available for a specific mission (depending on the type and class of mission). A variety of command and data handling (C&DH) developments for CubeSats have resulted from in-house development, from new companies that specialize in CubeSat avionics, and from established companies who provide spacecraft avionics for the space industry in general. Presently there are a number of commercial vendors who offer highly integrated systems that contain the onboard computer, memory, electrical power system (EPS), and the ability to support a variety of input and output (I/O) for the CubeSat class of small spacecraft.Wireless networks have been incorporated as crew support aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Wireless sensor networks have been flown as demonstrations. Dynamic self-configuring wireless networks have been evaluated in the lab. AIAA has defined the Space Plug-and-Play (SPA) standard, and flight demonstrations are planned.The maturation of additive manufacturing and 3D-printing technology are making embedded wireless sensors and avionics a possibility. Embedding transmission lines, antennas, connectors, and sensors onto a spacecraft structure turns that structure into a multifunctional system that reduces or eliminates bulky cables and connectors. Embedded passive wireless sensors can greatly increase sensing and telemetry capabilities, including providing low-cost techniques for vehicle health management in future missions. Moreover, flexible embedded passive sensors created with conductive and functional fabrics are enabling new opportunities for sensing in surfaces and systems where sensing has been traditionally absent, such as parachutes and inflatable structures.","NASA and other space agencies are exploring the application of SmallSats for deep space missions. The availability of modular wireless data connectivity alleviates complexity in testing and integration of systems. Modular components allow easier reconfiguration and late additions to any design. This is a benefit conferred on any spacecraft of any size, with the larger systems benefiting from savings in mass due to a larger reduction in cable harnesses and connectors.","

Current commercial constellations use ground-based semiautonomous scheduling and orbital maintenance to decrease the need for spacecraft-by-spacecraft human-in-the-loop decision making. However, each spacecraft is still individually commanded by the ground-based system. For missions operating beyond Earth, the spacecraft will need to be operated as a single unit. Enabling command and control capabilities within the flight element of the distributed mission will allow control of an otherwise impractical number of small spacecraft as well as decreased operational costs for missions with fewer spacecraft.NASA intends to expand the exploitation of small spacecraft swarms (or potentially constellations) in support of exploration and science missions. Multiple numbers of SmallSats, working in concert, offer unique capabilities and benefits to space researchers and satellite operators. For instance, some of these advantages embedded in fractionalized architectures, such as fault-tolerance and continuous repair and upgrades enabling dynamic, agile, adaptable mission plans, are better able to deal with the unplanned and unexpected. However, as the number of spacecraft grows, and destinations of interest move farther away from traditional low Earth orbit (LEO) orbits, operational challenges created by managing large numbers of agents along with significant space-to-ground communication latencies and bandwidth issues require alternative architectures that are able to make time-critical decisions and operate within the maneuvering limitations of each swarm member. Innovative technologies such as AI/ML can contribute significantly to the success of these deep space, multi-spacecraft missions by providing local control less reliant on the ground, as well as optimal use of propulsion.Small spacecraft operating in formation, in close proximity to other objects, or beyond the capacity of human-in-the-loop control will be required to process input onboard and execute correct responses autonomously. These sensor-driven operations will be enabling for safe proximity operations with spacecraft or small bodies as well as the detection and reaction to transient events for observation.This subtopic is interested in software agents and architectures that enable relative stationkeeping, multi-spacecraft orbit determination and prediction, autonomous reactive operations, and interspacecraft timing and communications to enable the above. Proposals should address software applications and/or network applications that enable:Efficient information exchange between individual spacecraft. Minimal reliance on ground commanding. Efficient use of space-qualified computing architectures. High-precision swarm navigation and control. Asymmetric use of ground assets (emphasizing space side over ground side).",3 to 5,"Level 1: TX 10 Autonomous Systems

Final report, including test results.","Currently, the operation of each small spacecraft is individually planned, scheduled, and commanded. Signals from each individual small spacecraft are acquired by ground stations individually. Volumes of unprocessed raw data demand high bandwidth, and this becomes even less practical for greater numbers of cooperative small spacecraft operating at farther distances. As SmallSats are deployed to the Moon, Mars, near-Earth objects (NEOs), and other distant locations, it is costly—in terms of antenna time and human labor—and impractical due to time-of-flight delays at long distance and the fast dynamics of formation flight and cooperative operations to command and control each spacecraft individually, to react to dynamic situations at very remote destinations, and to change the focus of observations, data acquisition, and sample manipulation as areas of interest are discovered at the target. Very little has been done with true swarms of SmallSats, especially in deep space or even lunar locales. Flight processors are becoming more capable, but advanced software, autonomous processes, and adaptive systems that take advantage of increased processing power for SmallSats lag behind. Intelligent, adaptive behaviors and autonomous decision making in reaction to changing conditions at the target, with minimal dependence on Earthbound operators, is needed.","The Small Spacecraft Technology Program is very interested in developing and demonstrating this technology for a broad list of crosscutting applications within the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD). Examples include:Fault-tolerant swarms composed of individual assets capable of reassigning their function to compensate for loss of an individual spacecraft. Spacecraft capable of decisions and tactical adaptation for acquiring, preprocessing, and transmitting scientific information (rather than raw data) at distant science or exploration destinations. Cooperative groups of spacecraft capable of disaggregated inspection, repair, resource resupply, and other functions autonomously and cooperatively at cislunar or more remote destinations.Small spacecraft conducting science will need to make observations, process dynamic conditions, make decisions, and adapt their performance without manual intervention (for example, sampling the eruption of a plume at Enceladus).Suggested use cases:Investigation of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) – Orbit determination and maneuvering around an asteroid. Coordinated sensor operations (remote sensing, etc.) between multiple spacecraft at planetary destinations. Coordinated observation of distant objects (stars, planets) using multiple sensor platforms. Autonomous formation flying and inspection of other space assets.","

As the most accessible spacecraft platform logistically and financially, small spacecraft benefit from a heritage based on rapid deployment and cost-effective missions. To further the state of the art (SOA) of both of these considerations, further cost savings may be found by standardizing the system architectures that drive the subsystems for these platforms. Such a realization would enable modular, hot-swappable spacecraft subsystems to accommodate the ever-increasing need for a wider definition of what small spacecraft are capable of and utilized for.The development of standardized, hot-swappable interfaces should be compliant with and cognizant of NASA spacecraft standards. Of particular interest are designs acquiescent to the Agency standards existing between grounding, thermal, software, and data transfer interfaces.The adaptability introduced by an open and modular, interchangeable commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) architecture furthers the ability to tailor current spacecraft designs for novel applications without requiring significant modifications to existing platforms. Also of interest are advances in modules that minimize complexity in spacecraft manufacturing (such as deterring geometrical modifications by virtue of manufacturing). Advances in additive manufacturing may enable critical enhancements to the performance of small-spacecraft systems by embedding otherwise impractical internal features (such as through holes and cavities for electronics integration).Systems that are applicable to small spacecraft (CubeSats up to Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) class), but scalable to large vehicles can result in a significant reduction of risk for more complex and longer duration missions.

The components should take advantage of supply-chain-compliant, heritage-relevant COTS whenever possible.","The current SOA leverages COTS and compiled standards for integrating small spacecraft into a functional system meeting varied mission requirements. A number of in-house developments within NASA have complemented progress in academia and private industry to develop the infrastructure required to expand and normalize the definition of small-spacecraft-compliant subsystems and instrumentation. An issue arises with the software and hardware architecture regulating the agreement of these subsystems with NASA standards. Commercial vendors offering plug-and-play components are often only compliant with a limited number of subsystems, and consequently there exists a need to address this with an open modular architecture to enable more rapid, compliant, and consequently cost-effective small spacecraft that meet NASA's standards. Notable standardization gaps exist within communication gaps (such as wireless systems) and interconnectivity protocols, including but not limited to sustainable (and commonly grounded) power and data transfer with respect to manufacturability considerations.","NASA and other space agencies are exploring the application of SmallSats for deep space missions. Modular architectures would enable a hot-swap adaptivity to altering mission requirements and serve as low-cost, rapid solutions for emerging destinations as they arise. Modular components allow easier reconfiguration and late additions to any design. Small-spacecraft modularity can be analogous for larger systems as well by virtue of defining and standardizing interconnectivity of universal COTS systems, enabling new objectives to be realized with a wide variety of instrumentation with a wide scope of requirements.","

Focus Area 21 Small Spacecraft Technologies,Z8.12Modular and Batch-Producible Small Spacecraft, ARC, MSFC, 2021,Batch-Producible Small Spacecraft,"This suptopic requests advances within modular open systems architectures for small spacecraft. As the most accessible spacecraft platform logistically and financially, small spacecraft benefit from a heritage based on rapid deployment and cost-effective missions. To further the state of the art (SOA) of both of these considerations, further cost savings may be found by standardizing the system architectures that drive the subsystems for these platforms. Such a realization would enable modular, hot-swappable spacecraft subsystems to accommodate the ever-increasing need for a wider definition of what small spacecraft are capable of and utilized for.The development of standardized, hot-swappable interfaces should be compliant with and cognizant of NASA spacecraft standards. Of particular interest are designs acquiescent to the Agency standards existing between grounding, thermal, software, and data transfer interfaces.The adaptability introduced by an open and modular, interchangeable commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) architecture furthers the ability to tailor current spacecraft designs for novel applications without requiring significant modifications to existing platforms. Also of interest are advances in modules that minimize complexity in spacecraft manufacturing (such as deterring geometrical modifications by virtue of manufacturing). Advances in additive manufacturing may enable critical enhancements to the performance of small-spacecraft systems by embedding otherwise impractical internal features (such as through holes and cavities for electronics integration).Systems that are applicable to small spacecraft (CubeSats up to Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) class), but scalable to large vehicles can result in a significant reduction of risk for more complex and longer duration missions. Near-term missions include:Cislunar, lunar orbiting, lunar landed, and exploration precursor. Low Earth orbit (LEO) “swarms” for Earth science and heliophysics. Disaggregated cooperative ensembles and sustained infrastructure for human exploration.New applications might include manned spacecraft inspection, repair, communications support, and related areas. Proposals that provide reliable performance in extreme environments and that show a path to a flight demonstration are preferable.The subtopic solicits developments in open modular architectures for small spacecraft and may include technologies that:Provide interchangeable hardware and software with standardized interfaces. Enable spacecraft to be built up from “plug and play” components. Improve the state of the art of open interfacing platforms suitable for small spacecraft, leveraging COTS wherever possible. Leverage novel manufacturing-in-the-loop considerations for small-spacecraft design standardization. Increase the reliability and durability of small-spacecraft hardware and software by integrating subsystem considerations directly into the design process at the architectural level.Demonstrate expanded adaptivity for small spacecraft, allowing for platforms to be rapidly varied with respect to altering objectives and variable risk postures.",3 to 6,"Level 1: TX 02 Flight Computing and Avionics

Successful demonstrations of this deliverable should demonstrate an increase in the competency of the following objectives:A standardized high-throughput manufacturing method to enable the fabrication of small spacecraft in batches of 30 to 100 buses (within the scope of CubeSats, up to and including ESPA-class spacecraft). A systematic decision tree that addresses fabrication turnaround-time considerations as a factor of spacecraft complexity. Demonstrated cost decreases for spacecraft batches with respect to the current state of the art (SOA). The integration and normalization of COTS relevant for batch production of small spacecraft as a function of supply chain availability and vendor capabilities.Phase II DeliverableIntegrating small-spacecraft standards into batch production and demonstrating an infrastructure that is batch-compliant. Successful demonstrations of this deliverable should demonstrate an increase in the competency of the following objectives:The integration of common NASA small-spacecraft standards (such as thermal, grounding, communications) directly into batch producibility.A method for rapid assembly of batch-produced small spacecraft that accounts for manufacturability directly into the architecture of common subsystems (such as power, communications, etc.).","The current SOA of batch-produced small spacecraft relies heavily on the industry-demonstrated heritage of COTS for small-satellites. These systems have limited throughput considerations and are currently inappropriate for meeting future mission requisites pertaining to small spacecraft requiring the fabrication and integration of 30 to 100 spacecraft at a time (such as those relevant to heliophysics missions, network demonstrations, and swarm considerations).","Partnership with industry on batch production of spacecraft will be required for distributed missions including synthetic apertures, disaggregated science observations, rapidly established planetary communications architectures, constellations, and sensor web applications; planned heliophysics missions call for 30 to 100 spacecraft. Technology development missions would also benefit from low-cost and shorter lead-time standardized bus platforms.","

Of specific interest are proposals that could lead to valuable terrestrial applications and foster a scalable and sustainable demand for commercial markets in LEO.

Focus Area 23 Digital Transformation for Aerospace,H6.04Model-Based Systems Engineering for Distributed Development, ARC,, 2021,Model-Based Systems Engineering for Distributed Development,"Systems Engineering technology is both a critical capability and a bottleneck for NASA human exploration development. NASA looks to a sustainable return to the Moon to enable future exploration of Mars, components such as Lunar Gateway and Artemis will require partnerships with a wide variety of communities. Building from the success of the international partnerships for International Space Station (ISS), space agencies from multiple governments are looking for roles on the Gateway. A particular focus has been made to include the rapidly growing commercial space industry to provide an important role in supporting a sustained presence on the Moon. All of these potential partners will have their own design capabilities and their own development processes and internal constituencies to support. Integrating and enabling disparate systems built in different locations by different owners to all work cohesively together will require a significant upgrade to the core-systems engineering capabilities. In the last decade, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) technology has matured as evidenced by the development of Systems Modeling Language (SysML) tools and frameworks that support engineers in development efforts from requirements through hardware and software implementation. MBSE holds considerable promise for accelerating, reducing overhead labor, and improving the quality of systems development. However, a remaining bottleneck is the coordination and integration of system development across distributed organizations, such as the multiple partners developing Lunar Gateway and eventual Mars exploration. This subtopic seeks technology to fill this gap. Areas of particular need include:Methodologies that support integration among tools and exchange of information between multidisciplinary artifacts using automated intelligent reasoning. The definition of open interface standards and tools to enable inspection of distributed models across engineering domains.Tools or systems that allow models to be shared across development environments and trace the resulting system model back to contributions from multiple partners while maintaining information security [International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), Export Administration Regulations (EAR), sensitive but unclassified (SBU)] and protecting intellectual property. Modeling visualization environments that facilitate user interaction from multiple stakeholders perspectives with varying expertise in MBSE. Executable requirements specification with precise semantic links disparate development sources.",4 to 6,"Level 1: TX 11 Software, Modeling, Simulation, and Information Processing
Level 2: TX 11.2 Modeling","Prototype
Software",Phase I: Prototype software to demonstrate proof of concept.Phase II: Functional software that is ready to be tested in an operational environment by end users.,"For distributed development, the state of the art tends to be laboriously negotiated interface control documents and manual integration processes that are inherently slow and labor intensive. In an effort to overcome these challenges, MBSE and SysML in particular has seen significant adoption at NASA (Gateway, Resource Prospector, Europa Clipper, Space Communications and Navigation [SCaN], Space Launch System [SLS]) especially after the MBSE Pathfinder (2016/2017) and MBSE Infusion And Modernization Initiative (MIAMI, 2018/2019) studies.However, these pilot programs and a survey of NASA's use of MBSE conducted by NASA Independent Verification & Validation (IV&V) and Ames Research Center identified critical challenges and factors of concern, including:Sharing and version control of models and information contained in the models. Integration of MBSE tools with domain specific tools. Steep learning curve for users with limited MBSE experience. Testing, verification, and validation with SysML have limited use. No tools exist for formally specifying requirements and linking to model properties. With programs such as Gateway and Artemis that require coordination among multiple NASA centers, international space agencies, and commercial partnerships these challenges will be amplified and should be considered when addressing the scope of this subtopic. Tool infrastructures that enable integrated support of requirements tracing, design reference points, intelligent reasoning of data, and interface constructs are generally not available except within proprietary boundaries. We need tools that support integrated development and model sharing across development environments and that support use across multiple vendors.","This subtopic would be of relevance to all Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) missions, but of particular interest will be Gateway and Artemis development. Those systems have already adopted the use of MBSE tools and tools sought to help reduce potential system integration bottlenecks. Over the next 3 to 5 years, there will be considerable opportunity for small business contributions to be matured and integrated into the support infrastructure as Gateway evolves from concept to development program. Longer term plans for human exploration, including a sustained lunar presence and manned Mars missions, would benefit from disruptive innovations that improve the entire project life-cycle including mission design, acquisition, development, and deployment.","

Focus Area 23 Digital Transformation for Aerospace,T11.04Digital Assistants for Science and Engineering, LaRC," ARC, JPL, JSC, MSFC", 2021,Digital Assistants for Science and Engineering,"NASA is seeking innovative solutions that combine modern digital technologies (e.g., natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, machine learning, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and augmented reality) to create digital assistants. These digital assistants can range in capability from low-level cognitive tasks (e.g., information search, information categorization and mapping, information surveys, and semantic comparisons), to expert systems, to autonomous ideation. NASA is interested in digital assistants that reduce the cognitive workload of its engineers and scientists so that they can concentrate their talents on innovation and discovery. NASA is also interested in digital assistants for operators and crew to improve safety and efficiency of facilities and vehicles. Digital assistant solutions can target tasks characterized as research, engineering, operations, data management and analysis (of science data, ground and flight test data, or simulation data), and business or administrative. Digital assistants can fall into one of two categories: productivity multipliers and new capabilities. Productivity multipliers reduce the time that the engineer, scientist, facility operator, and vehicle crew member spend on tasks defined by NASA policies, procedures, standards and handbooks, on common and best practices in science and engineering domains within the scope of NASA's missions, on standard operating procedures, on maintenance and troubleshooting, or on search and transformation of scientific and technical information. Proposals for productivity multipliers should demonstrate an in-depth understanding of NASA workflows and information needs for science, engineering, or operations. New capabilities are disruptive transformations of NASA’s engineering, science, facility, or vehicle environments that enable technological advances infeasible or too costly under current paradigms. Proposals for new capabilities should show clear applicability to NASA's missions. Moreover, proposals relying on natural language processing (NLP) of scientific and technical information should demonstrate capability or define a work plan to train NLP algorithms for technical and scientific terms that are in common use within NASA or within a science and engineering discipline. Proposals targeting digital assistants for crew must be deployable to hardware meeting space, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints typical for the vehicle(s) of interest. Furthermore, digital assistants for spacecraft must execute all functions onboard and cannot rely on ground systems to function. Additionally, digital assistants should be hands free especially for activities where crew are wearing spacesuits or are using their hands such as performing maintenance tasks. Examples of potential digital assistants include but are not limited to:A digital assistant that uses the semantic, numeric, and graphical content of engineering artifacts (e.g., requirements, design, and verification) to automate traces among the artifacts and to assess completeness and consistency of traced content. For example, the digital agent can use semantic comparison to determine whether the full scope of a requirement may be verified based on the description(s) of the test case(s) traced from it. Similarly, the digital assistant can identify from design artifacts any functional, performance, or nonfunctional attributes of the design that do not trace back to requirements. Currently, this work is performed by project system engineers, quality assurance personnel, and major milestone review teams. A digital assistant that can identify current or past work related to an idea by providing a list of related government documents, academic publications, and/or popular publications. This is useful in characterizing the state of the art when proposing or reviewing an idea for government funding. Currently, engineers and scientists accomplish this by executing multiple searches using different combinations of keywords from the idea text, each on a variety of search engines and databases; then the engineers read dozens of documents and returns to establish relevance. This example looks for digital assistive technologies to reduce this workload substantially. A digital assistant that can highlight lessons learned, suggest reusable assets, highlight past solutions or suggest collaborators based on the content that the engineer or scientist is currently working on. This example encourages digital solutions that can parse textual and/or graphical information from an in-progress work product and search Agency knowledge bases, project repositories, asset repositories, and other in-progress work products to identify relevantly similar information or assets. The digital assistant can then notify the engineer of the relevant information and/or its author (potential collaborator). A digital assistant that can recommend an action in real time to operators of a facility or the crew of a vehicle. Such a system could work from a corpus of system information such as design artifacts, operator manuals, maintenance manuals, and operating procedures to correctly identify the current state of a system given sensor data, telemetry, component outputs, or other real-time data. The digital assistant can then use the same information to autonomously recommend a remedial action to the operator when it detects a failure to warn the operator when their actions will result in a hazard or loss of a mission objective, or to suggest a course of action to the operator that will achieve a new mission objective given by the operator. A digital assistant that can create one or more component or system designs from a concept of operations, a set of high-level requirements, or a performance specification. Such an agent may combine reinforcement learning techniques, generative-adversarial networks, and simulations to autonomously ideate solutions. An expert system that uses a series of questions to generate an initial system model (e.g., using Systems Modeling Language (SysML)), plans, estimates, and other systems engineering artifacts. Question and answer (Q&A) bots: A digital agent that can answer commonly asked questions on ""how to"" for scientists and engineers (e.g., what resources (grounds facilities, labs, media services, and IT) are available; where to get site licenses for software packages; who to contact for assistance on a topic; answers for general business procedures such as procurement, travel, time and attendance, etc.).",3 to 5,"Level 1: TX 11 Software, Modeling, Simulation, and Information Processing

Software","The Phase I deliverable can be a detailed architecture for a digital assistant with supporting analysis or a set of individual or integrated software functions that substantiate features of the digital assistant considered key or high risk. Phase II would conclude with a demonstration (prototype) or a deployable digital assistant with quantifiable reduction in time or cost of an activity typically performed by NASA scientists, engineers, or operators.","Digitally assistive technologies currently permeate the consumer market with products like the Amazon Echo, Apple devices with Siri, Google devices with Google Assistant, and Microsoft devices with Cortana. Though Apple, Google, and Microsoft are also moving their assistive technologies into the enterprise space, these developments are largely focused on reducing information technology costs. Some cities and college campuses have also acted as early adopters of smart city or smart campus technologies that include digital assistants. However, application of these assistive technologies to engineering and science has largely been limited to university research. Moreover, most assistive technologies exercise no more cognition than a Q&A bot or executing simple commands. The emergence of improved natural language processing brings the possibility of digital assistants that can perform low-level cognitive tasks. This subtopic aims not only to bring commercially available assistive technologies to the engineering environment, but also to elevate their cognitive capabilities so that engineers and scientists can spend more time innovating and less time on low-level cognitive work that is laborious or repetitive.","This subtopic is related to technology investments in the NASA Technology Roadmap, Technical Area 11 Modeling, Simulation, Information Technology, and Processing under sections 11.1.2.6 Cognitive Computer, 11.4.1.4 Onboard Data Capture and Triage Methodologies, and 11.4.1.5 Real-Time Data Triage and Data Reduction Methodologies. This subtopic is seeking similar improvements in computer cognition more generally applied to the activities performed by engineers and scientists and made more easily accessible through technologies like speech recognition.","

Focus Area 23 Digital Transformation for Aerospace,T11.05Model-Based Enterprise, ARC," HQ, LaRC, MSFC, SSC", 2021,"Model-Based Enterprise, Digitally interacting comprehensive frameworks and models, and Automated Decision-Making for Agency Operations","Model-based enterprise targets the use of models in any function, from engineering to safety to finance to facilities and more (i.e., Model-based ""Anything"" or MBx), to enable high-complexity decision making embodying agile processes to achieve efficiency, accuracy, confidence, and adaptability in support of NASA’s mission, programmatic development, and institutional activities.Consider the implementation of Model-based Institutional Management, as an example, where outputs from one functional model become real-time inputs to another functional model, resulting in a digital workflow for knowledge transfer and holistic decision making; thus enabling transformative gains in engineering, institutional, and management practices. Ultimately, functional area models will be digitally integrated to form a model-based enterprise.NASA is seeking specific innovative, transformational, model-based solutions in the area of “Digital Twin” Institutional Management of Health/Automated Decision Support of Agency Facilities that would greatly enhance operational efficiencies, the quality and robustness and trustworthiness of information, the ability to identify and analyze risks earlier, and the overall velocity and robustness of knowledge transfer and decision making across the Agency, including interactions with internal/external partners and supply chain that are made possible through overarching an MBx Digital Twin Enterprise model(s).Health/Automated Decision Support of Agency Facilities represents an opportunity to make revolutionary changes in how our Agency conducts business by investing in nascent technologies. The Agency’s newly minted Digital Transformation Office is interested in how this initiative can help reposition and accelerate the modernization of digital systems that support modern approaches to managing the Agency's aging infrastructure.Recent initiatives in ""smart city"" technologies focus on condition-based/preventive maintenance, smart buildings and smart lighting, autonomous transportation and traffic management, industrial automation, etc. As we mature our understanding and make progress toward these ends at individual centers, we need to align our efforts and share lessons learned to help expedite NASA’s learning curve.Smart city technologies often rely on interconnected systems and interoperability of those systems, making it all the more important that we have a common approach and standards (e.g., around information technology (IT)/operational technology (OT) network architecture, communication protocols, and data management) to ensure interoperability of systems within and across centers. Without a cohesive approach, we risk limiting what NASA can achieve in terms of economies of scale and affordability, as well as interorganizational data integration.The STTR vehicle offers the small business community an opportunity to have a hand in this process towards repositioning and accelerating the modernization of digital systems supporting the Agency's aging infrastructure to:Save energy costs due to water and electricity usage that is poorly measured and managed. Enable the deployment of nascent technological trends in data-driven decision making and support tools based upon statistical methods to help streamline and improve the efficiency of facility operations and maintenance activities. Explore recent technologies in modeling (e.g., digital twin techniques). Explore how we can take advantage of the proliferation of emerging technologies, use a structured measurement and verification technique in and aim to vet them to determine if they will bring sufficient value, and broadly deploy them across the Agency if proven effective.Set up a ""proving ground,"" model, in the same spirit as GSA's emerging building technologies program(link is external).

Working integrated software framework capable of direct compatibility with existing programmatic tools.","Outside of NASA, industry is rapidly advancing Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tools and scaling them to larger, more complex development activities. Industry sees scaling as a natural extension of their ongoing digitization efforts. These scaling and extension efforts will result in reusable, validated libraries containing models, model fragments, patterns, contextualized data, etc. They will enable the ability to build upon, transform, and synthesize new concepts and missions, which has great attraction to both industry and government alike. Real-time collaboration and refinement of these validated libraries into either “single source” or “authoritative sources” of truth provide further appeal as usable knowledge can be pulled together much more quickly from a far wider breadth of available knowledge than was ever available before.One example of industry applying MB/MBe/MBSE is through Digital Thread™, a communication framework that helps facilitate an integrated view and connected data flow of the product's data throughout its life cycle. In other words, it helps deliver the right information at the right time and at the right place. Creating an “identical” copy (sometimes referred to as a ""digital twin"") is another use, a digital replica of potential and actual physical assets, processes, people, places, systems, and devices that can be used for various purposes. These twins are used to conduct virtual cost/technical trade studies, virtual testing, virtual qualification, etc., that are made possible through an integrated model-based network. Given the rise of MBSE in industry, NASA will need to keep pace in order to continue to communicate with industry, manage and monitor supply chain activities, and continue to provide leadership in spaceflight development.Within NASA, our organization is faced with increasingly complex problems that require better, timelier, integration, and synthesis of both models and larger sets of data, not only in the systems engineering or MBSE realm, but in the broader MB Institution, MB Mission Management, and MB Enterprise Architecture. NASA is challenged to sift through and pull out the particular pieces of information needed for specific functions, as well as to ensure requirements are traced into designs, tested, and delivered; thus, confirming that the Agency gets what it has paid for. On a broader cross-agency scale, we need to ensure that needed information is available to support critical decisions in a timely and cost-effective manner. All of these challenges are addressed through the benefits of model-based approaches. Practices such as reusability, common sources of data, and validated libraries of authoritative information become the norm, not the exception, using an integrated, model-based environment. This model-based environment will contribute to a diverse, distributed business model encompassing multicenter and government-industry partnerships as the normal way of doing business.","MBx solutions can benefit all NASA Mission Directorates and functional organizations. NASA activities could be dramatically more efficient and lower risk through MBx support of more automated creation, execution, and completion verification of important agreements, such as international, supply chain, or data use.","

Focus Area 24 Dust Mitigation,Z13.01Active and Passive Dust Mitigation Surfaces, KSC," JSC, LaRC", 2021,Advanced Technologies for Active Dust Mitigation,"Proposals are sought that use unique methods that may require power, gases, mechanisms, vibrations, or other means to keep vital surfaces clean under space conditions. Self-cleaning surfaces that require minimal effort by astronauts are highly desired. Proposers are expected to show an in-depth understanding of the current state of the art (SOA) and quantitatively describe improvements over relevant SOA technologies that substantiate investment in the new technology. Proposers must also quantitatively explain the operational benefit of the new technology from the perspective of improving or enabling mission potential. Some examples of active dust mitigation technologies include but are not limited to:Brushing: A self-cleaning brush to mechanically remove dust from surfaces. The brush can be mechanically operated using power, or temperature activated, such as shape memory alloys. Electrostatic removal: Methods to use direct-current (DC) electric fields to remove dust from surfaces, either internal to the surface (embedded) or external using a removed high-voltage source. Liquid removal: A jet of liquid is applied to the surface that traps particles and removes them from the surface. Vacuum: Methods to remove particles from surfaces using suction of gases. Jets: High-velocity gas jet that blows dust particles from surfaces. Spinning surfaces: Surface rotates in a manner that does not allow collection of dust on it. Vibrational surfaces: Vibrating surface bounces the particles off of the surface. Electrodynamic removal: The surface contains embedded electrodes with varying high-voltage signals applied to lift and transport dust off of the surface. Proposals are highly sought in which the active dust mitigation strategy could be combined with the SOA of passive dust mitigation technologies. For example, passive dust mitigation strategies include:Electrostatic discharge (ESD) coatings and films: Statically dissipative coatings are less likely to accumulate charge, and hence dust, in dry environments. Superhydrophobic coatings: Materials with a very high contact angle can lower the adhesion of water-based contaminants, not allowing the capillary forces to take hold. EVA and robotic-compatible dustproof electrical, fluid, and gas connectors. Dustproof bearings and mechanical spacesuit connectors. Dust-tolerant or dust-resistant hatches. Docking systems, including suitport docking systems and pressurized rover and habitat docking systems. Lotus leaf coating: Microscopic nanostructures used to limit the van der Waals force of adhesion. Peel-away coating: Removable surface coatings. Strong proposals are those that identify the active dust removal strategy in coordination with other dust prevention and removal methods as listed above.

Prototype
Hardware","A prototype of the new technology must be provided that shows the feasibility of the dust removal method. The technology must be a device showing the desired method working in a laboratory environment, removing and/or keeping dust from adhering to a surface. The ""dust"" utilized in these experiments must be an appropriate simulant with justification for the source and size distribution related to the intended application and lunar location. The mass, power, volume, and potential costs associated with the implementation of this technology must be addressed. Phase I deliverables shall consist of a final report. Samples or prototypes can also be delivered if available. Phase II deliverables shall consist of a final report and a prototype demonstrating surface dust mitigation.","All new technologies for Active Dust Mitigation must include a full knowledge base of the SOA, and proposals that advance the current SOA are encouraged. For example, NASA has developed the Electrodynamic Dust Shield (EDS), which lifts and transports dust off of surfaces with embedded electrodes within a dielectric. A brief but not complete introduction to the technology can be found in the references.The EDS can be incorporated into a variety of configurations addressing many of NASA’s needs. However, several potential improvements and technologies that can further the development of the EDS technology are also highly sought within this call. Some potential advances include:Miniaturized high-voltage three-phase power supply: The current SOA for the EDS power supply is approximately 10 × 5 × 3 cm. It is highly desired to have smaller power supplies both in size and power to drive the EDS waveform for a variety of applications. High dielectric breakdown strength for both glues/epoxies and the coating material: The efficiency of dust removal for the EDS is limited to amount of voltage that can be applied to the electrodes. The electrical breakdown occurs across the 2D surface because of the dielectric strength limitation of the adhering material as well as the coating material. Flexible transparent surfaces with high current capabilities: The optically transparent version of the EDS uses indium tin oxide (ITO) as the main conductive medium for its electrode. Although the EDS is not a high-current DC device, the displacement current (I dV/dt) can be quite high. Transparent electrode materials are sought that can replace ITO as the conductive medium that have higher current capabilities and lower overall resistivities. Another shortcoming of ITO is its range of flexibility. Many ITO coatings cannot be bent past a certain degree and are not compatible with numerous folds and bends. The EDS technology also works on fabrics. However, high-voltage flexible wires that can be used as threads are unavailable. The electrodes would need to be low profile and sufficient to withstand up to +10 kV DC before breakdown. A unique feature of the EDS on fabrics is that it needs to be a multilayer system, as most space fabrics are. One layer would have to support electrical grounding to protect the astronaut, but intermediate layers would have withstand high-voltage breakdown. The top layer would house the high-voltage wire system composed of the EDS requirements. Electrical attachment: Most EDS systems have issues with the electrical connections between the high-voltage power supply (HVPS) and the electrodes. Any possibility of arcing and/or sparking as a result of slight differences between the wiring from one material configuration to another is exacerbated when powered with EDS waveforms. Proposals are highly sought that address this key issue for attaching high-voltage wires to electrodes embedded in an EDS circuit. EDS circuit electrodes are made using a variety of materials such as copper (wires or vapor deposited), ITO, silver paint wires, carbon nanotube (CNT), and graphene, to name a few. Likewise, these and other electrodes are usually resting on or embedded into a substrate such as glass, polyimide (Kapton), clothing fibers, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), nylon, acrylic, Lucite, and other surfaces. Minimizing electromagnetic interference (EMI): Most EDS designs can generate electrical noise that would be disadvantageous if it were to be incorporated into a system. Methods to reduce electrical noise and EMI would be highly sought. Safety: With all EDS systems, the use of high voltage requires safety measures for the astronaut and the equipment. Methods to improve the safety and reliability of the EDS in the case of arcing is highly sought. Smart EDS technology: As with all dust mitigation technologies, methods to include adaptive techniques are highly sought. The system should be able to check its environment to see if dust clearing is necessary, and if it is, apply power to the system until the cleanliness requirements are met for reliability and power minimization.Other active systems also require maturation. Critical gaps in these areas include:Effective and scratch-resistant brushing techniques. Apollo astronauts used brushes that are largely ineffective for large surface areas and tended to scratch sensitive equipment, such as astronaut visors. Gaseous removal of dust on the lunar surface may contaminate other sensitive equipment. A better approach to gaseous or fluidized removal of dust is needed. Simple mechanical or vibrational dust mitigation implementations are required. As particles move, they also become highly electrostatically charged, further causing dust adhesion.","This subtopic's focus on adhesion of granular materials and technologies that address mitigation of this adhesion will advance the state of knowledge of this difficult research subject. The interplay between the surface’s energy, chemistry, and mechanical properties and the particle’s surface is a fascinating but not well-understood science. This call will not only extend exploration missions on the lunar surface but will enable exploration missions that would not have been possible. For example, on the Apollo missions, every mechanical seal was compromised over the course of 3 days due to the exposure to the dust. Research that elucidates this complex behavior toward lunar dust adhesion could be vital for realization of a sustained lunar presence, and although our understanding of the lunar environments has continued to improve, materials and technologies that arise from this research will improve our survival on dusty surfaces in space.","

Self-cleaning surfaces that require minimal effort by astronauts are highly desired. Proposers are expected to show an in-depth understanding of the current state of the art (SOA) and quantitatively describe improvements over relevant SOA technologies that substantiate investment in the new technology. Proposers must also quantitatively explain the operational benefit of the new technology from the perspective of improving or enabling mission potential. Some examples of active dust mitigation technologies include but are not limited to:Brushing: A self-cleaning brush to mechanically remove dust from surfaces. The brush can be mechanically operated using power, or temperature activated, such as shape memory alloys. Electrostatic removal: Methods to use direct-current (DC) electric fields to remove dust from surfaces, either internal to the surface (embedded) or external using a removed high-voltage source. Liquid removal: A jet of liquid is applied to the surface that traps particles and removes them from the surface. Vacuum: Methods to remove particles from surfaces using suction of gases. Jets: High-velocity gas jet that blows dust particles from surfaces. Spinning surfaces: Surface rotates in a manner that does not allow collection of dust on it. Vibrational surfaces: Vibrating surface bounces the particles off of the surface.

Hardware","At the end of the Phase I research period, it is expected that a material or technology will be identified and initial characterization results collected. Initial characterization should indicate whether further development of the technology would be scalable and should exhibit a dramatic reduction (>90% relative to full dust loading of a reference material surface such as an aerospace aluminum alloy or polymeric film surface such as Kapton or Teflon) in particulate adhesion for microparticles, specifically those described as lunar dust simulant, with diameters <50 µm. At the end of Phase II, it is expected that promising technologies will have been demonstrated through relevant environmental test conditions. The materials or technology should be demonstrated to be scalable to quantities sufficient for application beyond laboratory research requirements, i.e., at kilogram or greater quantities for materials or a similar measure for a passive technology. Cost analysis for scaling to mission-requirements level, as will be elucidated through the course of this research, will also be required.If a Phase II is awarded, further development of the technology shall be required, including a prototype delivered to NASA at the end of the 2-year project with a goal of achieving Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6. A prototype of the new technology must be provided that shows the feasibility of the dust removal method. The technology must be demonstrated to remove adhered dust or prevent dust adhesion in a laboratory environment simulating some aspects of lunar environmental conditions. Durability of the material surface toward lunar dust abrasion, thermal cycling, and other environmental considerations should also be addressed. The mass, power, volume, and potential costs associated with the implementation of this technology must be addressed. A well-developed infusion plan resulting in a flight demonstration must also be provided.","Although a myriad of materials and technologies exist for mitigation of surface contamination for a variety of terrestrial applications, requirements for mitigation of lunar dust adhesion indicate diminished efficacy of many materials. As an example, silicones are used ubiquitously to reduce adhesive interactions and can be effective for contamination prevention across a range of contaminants, but these relatively soft materials would exhibit deleterious properties in a traditional manifestation arising from particulate embedding due to the sharp edges and hardness of the lunar dust. Likewise, hard traditional ceramic materials have been shown to be beneficial for terrestrial applications. Triboelectrification of an insulating material, however, would increase adhesion interactions with lunar dust. Beyond these specific lunar dust properties, magnetic interactions, chemical activity, and the velocity of the lunar dust, especially at the lunar terminator, all contribute to adhesion and therefore must be addressed for a material to be expected to perform well in this environment. Refer to the Advanced Technologies for Active Dust Mitigation scope for a description of several state-of-the-art active dust mitigation technologies.","This subtopic's focus on adhesion of granular materials and technologies that address mitigation of this adhesion will advance the state of knowledge of this difficult research subject.

From the operational experience gained and lessons learned during the Apollo missions, conducting long-term operations in the lunar environment will be a particular challenge given the difficulties presented by the unique physical properties and other characteristics of lunar regolith, including dust. The Apollo missions and other lunar exploration have identified significant lunar dust-related problems that will challenge future mission success. Lunar dust is composed of regolith particles ranging in size from tens of nanometers to microns, and lunar dust concerns are a manifestation of the complex interaction of the lunar soil with multiple mechanical, electrical, and gravitational effects.Mechanical systems will need to operate on the dusty surface of the Moon for months to years. These systems will be exposed to the harsh regolith dust and will have little to no maintenance. This scope seeks technologies that will protect from or tolerate dust intrusion in the following areas:Rotary joints (steering, suspension, hinges, bearings, etc.). Linear joints (latches, shafts, restraint systems, landing gear, etc.).

Terrestrial solutions often employ materials or methods that are incompatible with the lunar environment.Critical Gaps:Rotary joints. Seals: Rotary joints are very common for actuation in dusty environments because of the widespread availability of rotary seals. Most of these seals, however, use elastomers that would off-gas and become brittle in a lunar environment. Solutions are needed that employ materials or nontraditional techniques that can operate in the lunar environment for an extended period of time (months to years). Bearings: Regolith getting past the protective seals of rotary joint bearings is a common failure point. Bearings designs that are highly dust tolerant may be needed to reduce the risk of failures due to dust intrusion. Successful technologies will have operational lifetimes on the order of millions of cycles in a relevant lunar environment. Linear joints. Seals: Linear joints are less common in dusty environments because of the challenge of sealing the sliding joints. Similar to rotary seals, linear joint seals are often made from elastomers and would need to be modified to operate in a lunar environment. Solutions are needed that employ materials or nontraditional techniques that can operate in the lunar environment for an extended period of time (months to years). Bearings: Regolith getting past the protective seals of linear joint bearings is a common failure point. Bearings designs that are highly dust tolerant may be needed to reduce the risk of failures due to dust intrusion. Successful technologies will have operational lifetimes on the order of hundreds of thousands of cycles in a relevant lunar environment. Static joints. Operations on the lunar surface will include assembly, construction, and extravehicular activity (EVA) tasks. These tasks will involve the mating/demating of various structural, electrical, and fluid connections. Dust on the surface of these joints will impede their proper function and lead to failures. Solutions are needed to protect these joints from dust contamination. Successful technologies will have operational lifetimes on the order of thousands of cycles in a relevant lunar environment.","Dust will be one of the biggest challenges for operation on the lunar surface for the Artemis program.“I think dust is probably one of our greatest inhibitors to a nominal operation on the Moon.

Focus Area 24 Dust Mitigation,Z13.03Lunar Dust Mitigation Technology for Spacesuits, JSC," GRC, JSC, LaRC", 2021,Garment Protection,"The multilayered fabric system (layup) that protects the structure of the suit from the extremes of the space environment is called the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) environmental protection garment (EPG). The EPG, especially the environment-facing EPG shell fabric, is the suit’s first line of defense against the extreme environment of the lunar surface. The EPG system must not only survive the environment but must perform per requirements and offer a level of protection to the underlying pressure garment system (PGS), portable life support system (PLSS), and informatics system.The EPG is subjected to the following extreme environments:1. ThermalExtreme hot (260 °F, 127 °C). Extreme cold (-280 °F, -173 °C). Possible exposure to permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) (-373 °F, -225 °C).2. Lunar regolith/dustHighly abrasive. Durability in the dust environment is a key requirement. The spacesuit must operate over prolonged exposure to and operation in the dusty regolith environment. This includes kneeling on the ground, thousands of walking cycles, and cleaning before ingressing the vehicle. Electrostatically charged. The suit is also required to severely limit the amount of dust brought into the vehicle. Therefore, materials that are easily cleaned and/or dissipative so that dust does not adhere to the suit are sought.3. RadiationThe material must be able to be durable over hundreds of hours of ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure. It is primarily only the environment-facing layer (outmost layer) of the EPG that must be resistant to degradation from the UV environment. To prevent damage from discharges, NASA is considering materials that support an EPG that is dissipative.4. Enriched oxygen atmosphere of the lunar lander in the Artemis programThe lunar lander in the Artemis program will have an atmosphere of 34±2% oxygen at a pressure of 8.2 psi (56.5 kPa). During the period the astronauts reside in the lander, they will need nonflammable materials for the outer layer of their lunar spacesuits.5. Suit penetration protectionLunar secondary ejecta. Microgravity impact. Low Earth orbit (LEO) micrometeroids.6. PlasmaCharged environment in contact with the suit.In addition to the extreme environments, other requirements include the following:1. Optical propertiesThe EPG shall have an average ratio of solar absorptivity to infrared emissivity (α/ε) of 0.21 (TBR). The EPG shall have an average solar absorption of 0.18 (TBR).2. MassUsing the current fabric layers, as a component the EPG weighs on the order of 16 lb. EMU layup mass (with seven layers aluminized Mylar) = 30.84 oz/yd2 (1.92 lb/yd2). Orthofabric = 14.0 oz/yd2 + 1.0 - 0.5. Aluminized Mylar = 1.12 oz/yd2 maximum. Neoprene-coated nylon = 9.0 oz/yd2 maximum. NASA has a goal of a 25% weight reduction.3. Mobility impactsWhile it is understood that the layered materials of the EPG will increase torque in the spacesuit joint by a small amount, the EPG cannot significantly affect mobility of the suit. This requires that the individual materials and the combination of the fabric layers of the EPG allow for joint mobility, such as bending of the elbow. The fabrics themselves must be flexible, and they must be flexible during exposure to the other environmental extremes, such as extreme low temperature and vacuum. Within the environment listed above, the EPG must be flexible and low mass while meeting all other architectural, functional, interface, structural, and design and construction requirements imposed on the xEMU and EPG system.Past program solutions do not meet the requirements of the Artemis program sustaining missions.Beta fabric, the glass fiber fabric used in the Apollo spacesuit, addressed only the high flammability risk in the Apollo Lunar Module (LM) atmosphere of 100% oxygen at 4.8 psi (33 kPa). The three extravehicular activities (EVAs) in the last Apollo mission, with an average combined duration of 22 hr, resulted in damage to the outer fabric of the Apollo spacesuits, and the suits could not have endured more EVAs. The glass fiber developed for NASA was the first-ever textile microfiber (3.8-µm fiber diameter) that would not burn in a 100% oxygen atmosphere, but it did not have the mechanical properties to withstand abrasion from the lunar regolith.In the EMU program for the Space Shuttle and International Space Station, the shell fabric was designed for LEO, a significantly different environment from the lunar South Pole. The most notable difference is the absence of abrasives in LEO—no lunar dust. Orthofabric, the three-fiber shell fabric developed for the Space Shuttle suit outer layer, was designed for the Shuttle airlock oxygen concentration of 30% at 10.2 psi (70.3 kPa) and for durability. While the Orthofabric does not support combustion in an exploration environment of 36% oxygen atmosphere at 8.2 psi, it is a woven fabric. The interstices of the weave (gaps between yarns) allow for some amount of lunar dust to penetrate, and therefore it is a poor barrier to dust. In addition, the GORE-TEX expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) film is easily abraded by the dust. Although GORE-TEX is a PTFE (Teflon) and inert, it can accumulate a charge.In short, NASA is without adequate softgoods/textile solutions for the outermost layer of the EPG system that covers the xEMU suit system. NASA is looking for innovative materials solutions, likely requiring a layup of materials, to address all of the requirements listed above.",3 to 4,"Level 1: TX 06 Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation Systems

The EPG system must not only survive the environment but must perform per requirements and offer a level of protection to the underlying pressure garment system (PGS), portable life support system (PLSS), and informatics system.The EPG is subjected to the following extreme environments:1. ThermalExtreme hot (260 °F, 127 °C). Extreme cold (-280 °F, -173 °C). Possible exposure to permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) (-373 °F, -225 °C).2. Lunar regolith/dustHighly abrasive. Durability in the dust environment is a key requirement. The spacesuit must operate over prolonged exposure to and operation in the dusty regolith environment. This includes kneeling on the ground, thousands of walking cycles, and cleaning before ingressing the vehicle. Electrostatically charged. The suit is also required to severely limit the amount of dust brought into the vehicle. Therefore, materials that are easily cleaned and/or dissipative so that dust does not adhere to the suit are sought.3. RadiationThe material must be able to be durable over hundreds of hours of ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure. It is primarily only the environment-facing layer (outmost layer) of the EPG that must be resistant to degradation from the UV environment. To prevent damage from discharges, NASA is considering materials that support an EPG that is dissipative.4. Enriched oxygen atmosphere of the lunar lander in the Artemis programThe lunar lander in the Artemis program will have an atmosphere of 34±2% oxygen at a pressure of 8.2 psi (56.5 kPa). During the period the astronauts reside in the lander, they will need nonflammable materials for the outer layer of their lunar spacesuits.5. Suit penetration protectionLunar secondary ejecta. Microgravity impact. Low Earth orbit (LEO) micrometeroids.6. PlasmaCharged environment in contact with the suit.In addition to the extreme environments, other requirements include the following:1. Optical propertiesThe EPG shall have an average ratio of solar absorptivity to infrared emissivity (α/ε) of 0.21 (TBR). The EPG shall have an average solar absorption of 0.18 (TBR).2. MassUsing the current fabric layers, as a component the EPG weighs on the order of 16 lb. EMU layup mass (with seven layers aluminized Mylar) = 30.84 oz/yd2 (1.92 lb/yd2). Orthofabric = 14.0 oz/yd2 + 1.0 - 0.5. Aluminized Mylar = 1.12 oz/yd2 maximum. Neoprene-coated nylon = 9.0 oz/yd2 maximum. NASA has a goal of a 25% weight reduction.3. Mobility impactsWhile it is understood that the layered materials of the EPG will increase torque in the spacesuit joint by a small amount, the EPG cannot significantly affect mobility of the suit. This requires that the individual materials and the combination of the fabric layers of the EPG allow for joint mobility, such as bending of the elbow. The fabrics themselves must be flexible, and they must be flexible during exposure to the other environmental extremes, such as extreme low temperature and vacuum. Within the environment listed above, the EPG must be flexible and low mass while meeting all other architectural, functional, interface, structural, and design and construction requirements imposed on the xEMU and EPG system.Past program solutions do not meet the requirements of the Artemis program sustaining missions.Beta fabric, the glass fiber fabric used in the Apollo spacesuit, addressed only the high flammability risk in the Apollo Lunar Module (LM) atmosphere of 100% oxygen at 4.8 psi (33 kPa). The three extravehicular activities (EVAs) in the last Apollo mission, with an average combined duration of 22 hr, resulted in damage to the outer fabric of the Apollo spacesuits, and the suits could not have endured more EVAs. The glass fiber developed for NASA was the first-ever textile microfiber (3.8-µm fiber diameter) that would not burn in a 100% oxygen atmosphere, but it did not have the mechanical properties to withstand abrasion from the lunar regolith.In the EMU program for the Space Shuttle and International Space Station, the shell fabric was designed for LEO, a significantly different environment from the lunar South Pole. The most notable difference is the absence of abrasives in LEO—no lunar dust. Orthofabric, the three-fiber shell fabric developed for the Space Shuttle suit outer layer, was designed for the Shuttle airlock oxygen concentration of 30% at 10.2 psi (70.3 kPa) and for durability. While the Orthofabric does not support combustion in an exploration environment of 36% oxygen atmosphere at 8.2 psi, it is a woven fabric. The interstices of the weave (gaps between yarns) allow for some amount of lunar dust to penetrate, and therefore it is a poor barrier to dust. In addition, the GORE-TEX expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) film is easily abraded by the dust. Although GORE-TEX is a PTFE (Teflon) and inert, it can accumulate a charge.In short, NASA is without adequate softgoods/textile solutions for the outermost layer of the EPG system that covers the xEMU suit system. NASA is looking for innovative materials solutions, likely requiring a layup of materials, to address all of the requirements listed above.",3 to 4,"Level 1: TX 06 Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation Systems

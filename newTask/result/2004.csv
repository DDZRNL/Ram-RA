Exploration Systems,Topic B5 Flight Payload Technologies and Outreach ,B5.01Telescience and Flight Payload Operations, MSFC, ARC,"NASA has interest in the development of science and experiments that support strategic aspects of exploration, as well as to develop the technologies to extend humanity's reach to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. Preparing for exploration and research will require the acceleration of the development of new technologies that will be imperative to future telescience and payload operations. It is important that the space missions and experiments for biological and physical research be managed using new tools, models, and procedures that improve telescience and flight payload operations. In addition, NASA wants to make available data and information associated with microgravity research investigations and results. The ability for developers to access existing and new tools and collaborate in the design, simulation, modeling, building, and testing will be crucial to the success of NASAs new initiative. New methods of computing, accessing disparate data spread over wide geographical areas will require new approaches to computing, data storage and communications. There are many potential users for NASA services and data located throughout the U.S. There are three general types of users of these services and data. The first type is the principal investigator (PI)/payload developer (PD) who is responsible for the payload, experiment, and attendant science, and who commands the payload or experiment. The second type is the secondary investigator(s) who participates in analysis of the science and its control, but does not send commands. The third type is the educational user, from secondary school students up to graduate students. These users will receive either data processed by the PI or unprocessed data. Commercial investigations require the ability to receive, process, and display telemetry, view video from science sources, including the ISS, and interact with NASA concerning the science and operations. To conduct or be involved in general science activities, including the ISS science operations, a user will require various services from the Payload Operations Integration Center (POIC) located at the Marshall Space Flight Center near Huntsville, Alabama, or from other control centers located at various NASA facilities. These services are required to enable the experiment to be controlled using the inputs from various video sources, telemetry, and the crew. The input allows the experimenter to send to his/her payload or experiment commands to change various experiment operations. Before an experiment can get underway, an experimenter must participate in the payload planning process to schedule onboard services such as power, crew time, and cryogenics. This planning process is integral to the entire payload/carrier operation and requires the PI/PD or his/her representatives to participate via voice or video teleconferencing. To enable a user to operate from his/her home base, whether located in a laboratory, office, or home; these services (commensurate to the level of operation) must be provided at the user's location at a reasonable cost. Costs include both the platform upon which these services will run, and the communications required to provide these services to the experimenter's location. Proposals are sought for innovative ideas and efficiencies for systems to better effect communication and handling of data and information for scientific and commercial research on the International Space Station payloads and on manned exploration missions, and at the same time, for general use as applicable.

One particular emphasis is on the prevention and suppression of in-flight fire and explosions, as well as fuel tank explosions and post-crash fires. Aircraft fires represent a small number of actual accident causes, but the number of fatalities due to in-flight, post-crash, and on-ground fires is large. A second emphasis is on mitigating the safety risk and collateral damage due to unexpected failures of rotating components. Although the FAA mandates a blade containment and rotor unbalance requirement (FAR Part 33, Section 33.94) as part of the airworthiness standards for turbine aircraft engines, there are substantial potential (aircraft-engine) system benefits to be gained by enabling safety assured, lighter weight, lower cost, and more damage-tolerant designs for engine case/containment systems and associated (primary load path) structures.

Biological Fluid Mechanics (Biofluids) Biofluids, an intersection of fluid physics and biology, is a new area of emphasis within NASA's Office of Biological and Physical Research (OBPR). Fluid mechanics and transport processes play a critical role in many biological and physiological systems and processes. An adequate understanding of the underlying fluid physics and transport phenomena can provide new insight and techniques for analyzing and designing systems that are critical to NASA's mission. The microgravity environment modifies vascular fluid distribution on a short time scale, because of the loss of hydrostatic pressure, and on a longer time scale, because of the shift of intercellular flows. This fluid shift could modify transport processes throughout the body. For example, modification of flow and resulting stresses within blood vessels could modify vascular endothelial cell structure and permeability, which may be detrimental in long-term inter-planetary space flight. Furthermore, reintroduction of gravity causes large-scale fluid shifts in the body, which can influence cardiac output and induce faintness. Studies of macro- and microscale biofluid mechanics of the vascular system in the microgravity environment may be important to understanding these physiological events. Innovations sought include but are not limited to the following:Studies of biological fluid mechanics that seek answers to questions related to effect of long-term exposure to microgravity on human physiology; Understanding the role of fluid physics and transport phenomena in the ""fluid shift"" observed in the human body when exposed to prolonged microgravity; and Understanding the role fluid physics plays in human physiological processes such as cardiovascular flows and its effect on arteriosclerosis, and pulmonary flows and asthma. BioMicroFluidics Many biotechnology applications need manipulation of fluids moving through micro channels. As a result, microfluidic devices are becoming increasingly useful for biological/biotechnological applications.

Biological and Physical Research,Topic B3 Biomedical and Human Support Research ,B3.02Space Human Factors and Human Performance, JSC, ARC,"The long-term goal for this subtopic is to enable planning, designing, and carrying out human space missions of up to 5 years with crew independence, without resupply and without real-time communications to Earth. Specifically, this subtopic's focus is the development of innovations in crew equipment; and the development of technologies for assessment, modeling, and enhancement of human performance; and the development of design tools for engineers to incorporate human factors engineering requirements into hardware and software. Proposals are solicited that seek to develop technologies that address these specific needs:Monitoring and maintaining human performance nonintrusively. Specifically, minimally invasive and unobtrusive devices and techniques to monitor the behavior and performance (physical, cognitive, perceptual, etc.) of individuals and teams during long-duration space flights or analog missions. Technologies to track locations of individuals within habitats, and report on physiological or other state information. Methods and models for human performance prediction, including physical performance, as affected by encumbrances of clothing, space suits, etc. Predictive modeling of effects on the crew due to potential spacecraft environments and operational procedures. Develop computational models of the crew environment and of human performance and behavior to simulate the effects of factors that contribute to (or degrade) long-term performance capabilities. Such models of the environment, individual, and group behaviors and performance can be used to simulate and explore the conditions that influence human performance (e.g., fatigue, noise, CO2, microgravity, group dynamics, etc.). Such capabilities would include digital models of human operators and routine and emergency tasks that interact in the context of the long-duration human exploration environment. Tools to aid in design and evaluation of human-system interfaces for speed, accuracy, and acceptability in a cost-effective and reliable manner: Automated analysis of computer-user interfaces for complex display systems to conduct objective review of displays and controls, and to determine compliance with guidelines and standards. Quantitative measures of the effectiveness of user interfaces to be used for task-sensitive evaluations. Tools that facilitate the user interface design for human computer interfaces, and for facilitators, such as procedures, labels, and instructions. Tools should assist the designer in incorporating contextual information such as the users task, the users knowledge, and the system limitations. Tools to build just-in-time system and operational information software to aid human users conducting routine and emergency operations and activities. Such tools might include effective and efficient job aids (e.g., ""intelligent"" manuals, checklists, warnings) and support for designing flexible interfaces between users and large information systems. Methods for development of facilitators (procedures, labels, etc.) adapted for the development of space vehicle and payload applications.

Biological and Physical Research,Topic B3 Biomedical and Human Support Research ,B3.03Human Adaptation and Countermeasures, JSC, ARC,"In order for humans to live and function safely and efficiently in space or in the hypogravity of the Moon (1/6g) or Mars (3/8g), a good understanding of the effects of micro- and hypogravity and other factors associated with the space environment on human physiology and human responses to the space and extraplanetary environments is required. A variety of countermeasures must be developed to oppose the deleterious changes that occur in space and upon subsequent exposure to other gravitational fields. The ability to monitor the effectiveness of countermeasures and alterations in human physiology during space exploration missions, particularly when several countermeasures are used concurrently, is equally important. This subtopic seeks innovative technologies in several very specific key areas. As launch costs relate directly to mass and volume, instruments and sensors must be small and lightweight with an emphasis on multi-functional capabilities. Low power consumption is a major factor, as are design enhancements to improve the operation, design reliability, and maintainability of these instruments in the environment of space and on planetary surfaces. As the efficient use of time is extremely important, innovative instrumentation setup, ease of usage, improved astronaut (patient) comfort, noninvasive sensors, and easy-to-read information displays are also very important considerations. Extended shelf-life and ambient storage conditions of consumables are also key necessities. Ability to operate in 0g, 1g, and 3/8g become more important as we push for future human Moon and Mars missions. Immersive Virtual Scene Display System Development of an immersive visual display system is required to be interfaced with treadmill exercise devices. This system would not be head-mounted but would be free standing and provide at least a 180° field of view. This visual display would allow visual flow patterns to be displayed to a non-encumbered subject during inflight or on-surface treadmill exercise. Ultra-long duration missions to the Moon or Mars will especially benefit from such technology that encourages crew to spend more time exercising by enriching the environment and contribute to psychological well being by mimicking the terrestrial exercise experience. Measurement of Emboli in the Brain A small Doppler ultrasound device (need not be oxygen compatible), emboli recognition system/software, and solid-state recorder of detected events. This would be worn in a fashion similar to a Holter monitor and help to monitor blood clots in the brain for those at risk for embolic stroke. This is especially valuable for ensuring the safety of Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) on planetary surfaces, as well as during orbital flight. Noninvasive Pharmacotherapy and Monitoring Development of innovative technologies resulting in noninvasive methods for diagnosis, treatment, and therapeutic drug monitoring is needed to facilitate effective pharmacotherapy of humans in space. Many questions remain about the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals in micro- and hypogravity environments, which may interfere with their activity by sensitizing or desensitizing the crew member or interfering in other ways with the desired physiological effect. MEMS-Based Human Blood Cell Analyzer Development of a small, automated, micro- and hypogravity capable, lightweight, low power instrument that will analyze a small sample (microliter quantity) of human whole blood and provide a complete blood cell count (RBC, WBC, platelet, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, WBC differential, and calculated RBC indices) that correlates with traditional ground-based impedance or light-scattering technologies is needed. Likely devices based on MEMS will employ a biocompatible combination of microfluidics, micromechanics, micro-optics, microelectronics, and data telemetry capabilities in an integrated handheld package with a simple, user-friendly operator interface. Such technologies will be critical to the implementation of future missions beyond low-Earth orbit to the Moon or Mars. Proper medical care and valuable research contributions will be dependent on such technologies in these exploration class missions. Human-Worn Whole Body Biomechanical and Movement Analysis Suit A whole-body suit and analysis system worn by human subjects is needed, which records and measures biomechanical movements and biomechanical characteristics in order to provide an assessment of total body physical activity during human space missions, especially missions to hypogravity environments such as the Moon or Mars. Measurements to be made and recorded would include upper and lower limb segment displacements along with related joint angular velocities and accelerations. The system would allow entry of limb segment and trunk mass and center-of-mass data specific to the individual wearing the suit and then would provide data analysis related to work and power across different body segments and for the whole body based on analytical algorithms. Other capabilities include storage of raw data and the ability to download the data to other computer-based storage and data analysis systems through either hardwired connections or via telemetry. Many differences may be noted in the way humans move in micro- and hypogravity environments. These differences may suggest better ways to perform work or to design tools, workstations, or procedures for accomplishing critical tasks in the future beyond low-Earth orbit missions. Body Composition Hardware for Spaceflight Development of on-orbit instrumentation for determining body composition. Specific parameters of interest include lean body mass, total fat mass, and total body water. Validation data will be required using the current gold-standard techniques in this field. This information will be used in conjunction with nutritional status protocols to assess crew health. The effects of the hypogravity environment of planetary surfaces on body composition are not known. Any future mission to the Moon or Mars will certainly measure these changes to detect and combat potential adverse changes. Such an instrument must work in 0g, 1/6g, and 3/8g environments. Device for Providing Increased Neuromuscular Activation During Spaceflight Astronauts returning from spaceflight exhibit post-flight postural and gait instabilities that are a result of neural adaptation to microgravity. A small, lightweight countermeasure device is required to stimulate somatosensory receptors on the plantar surface of the feet during in-flight exercise with the goal of increasing neuromuscular activation and enhancing sensorimotor integration. This system would integrate with in-flight exercise hardware and coupled with visual stimulation systems would allow a more complete sense of immersion to enhance in-flight postural and locomotor training.

Biological and Physical Research,Topic B3 Biomedical and Human Support Research ,B3.04Food and Galley, JSC, ARC,"As NASA begins to look beyond low-Earth orbit and to plan for future exploration missions, such as to the Moon or Mars, new food science technologies will be needed. The impossibility of regularly resupplying a Mars crew means that the prepackaged shelf-stable food, ingredients, and equipment to provide a complete diet for six crewmembers for more than three years will have to be carried with them. As the crew remains on the Moon or Mars surface, crops will be grown to supplement the crew's diet, using plants to revitalize the air and water supply. Methods are needed, therefore, for processing potential food crops. Areas in which innovations are solicited follow below. Long-Duration, Shelf-Stable Food An initial trip to the Moon or Mars will require a stored food system that is nutritious, palatable, and provides a sufficient variety of foods to support significant crew activities on a mission of at least three years duration. Development of highly acceptable, shelf-stable food items that use high-quality ingredients is important to maintaining a healthy diet. Foods should maintain safety, acceptability, and nutrition, for the entire shelf life of 35 years. Shelf-life extension may be attained through new food preservation methods and/or packaging. Once on the lunar or planetary surface, it may be possible to use bulk packaging of meals or snack items. These food products will require specialized processing conditions and packaging materials. Advanced Packaging The current food packaging technologies represent a potentially significant trash-management problem for exploration-class missions to the Moon or Mars. New food packaging technology is needed that minimizes waste by using packaging with less mass and volume and/or by using packaging that is biodegradable or recyclable. Another opportunity would be development of a packaging material that can readily be reused by the crew to make objects of value to the space flight mission. Food Processing Advanced life-support systems, which use chemical, physical, and biological processes, are being developed to support future human planetary exploration. One such system might grow crops hydroponically and then process them into edible food ingredients or table-ready products. Variations in crop quality, crop yield, and nutrient content may occur over the course of long-duration missions, posing further requirements to the food processing and storage system. Such variations might affect the shelf stability and functional properties of the bulk ingredients and ultimately, the quality of the final food products. Equipment to process crops on missions to the Moon and Mars should be highly reliable, safe, automated, and should minimize crew time, power, water, mass, and volume. Equipment for processing raw materials must be suitable for use in hypogravity (e.g., 1/6g on Moon, 3/8g on Mars) and in hermetically sealed habitats. Some potential crops for advanced life-support systems include minimally processed crops such as lettuce, spinach, carrots, tomatoes, onions, cabbage, bell peppers, strawberries, fresh herbs, and radishes. Other baseline crops that require processing would be wheat, soybeans, white potatoes, sweet potatoes, peanuts, dried beans, rice, and tomatoes. There is a need to develop one or more pieces of food processing equipment for each of these crops. Food Safety Assurances of food quality and food safety are essential components in the maintenance of crew health and well-being. Food quality and safety efforts should be focused on monitoring the shelf stability of processed food ingredients and on identification and control of microbial agents of food spoilage, including the development of countermeasures to ameliorate their effects. Determination of radiation on crop functionality and the stored food system shelf life is also needed in the development of the food system. For all food production and processing procedures, Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) must be established. Read less>>"

Efforts are currently focused on missions ranging from a return to the Moon and through an initial Mars mission, including using the International Space Station as a test bed for research and technology validation. These future life-support systems must provide additional mass balance closure to further reduce logistics requirements and to promote self-sufficiency. Requirements include safe operability in micro- and partial-gravity, ambient and reduced-pressure environments, high reliability, minimal use of expendables, ease of maintenance, and low-system volume, mass, and power. Recovery of useful resources from liquid and solid wastes will be essential. Innovative, efficient, practical concepts are needed in all areas of resource recovery processes, providing the basic life-support functions of water reclamation and waste management. In addition to these long-duration space applications, innovative regenerative life-support approaches that could have terrestrial application are encouraged. Phase-I proof of concept should lead to Phase-II hardware development that could be integrated into a life-support system test bed. Proposals should include estimates for power, volume, mass, logistics, and crew time requirements as they relate to the technology concepts. More information on advanced life support systems can be found at http://advlifesupport.jsc.nasa.gov. Areas in which innovations are solicited in the following areas: Water Reclamation Efficient, direct treatment of wastewater consisting of urine, wash water, and condensates, to produce potable and hygienic waters. Physicochemical methods for primary treatment to reduce the total organic carbon concentration of the wastewater from 1000 mg/L to less than 50 mg/L and/or the total dissolved solids from 1000 mg/L to less than 100 mg/L. Post-treatment methods to reduce total organic carbon from 100 mg/L to less than 0.25 mg/L in the presence of 50 mg/L bicarbonate ions, 25 mg/L ammonium ions and 25 ppm other inorganic ions.

Techniques to minimize or eliminate biofilm or microbial contamination from potable water systems and water treatment systems, including fluid handling components such as pipes, tanks, flow meters, check valves, regulators, etc. Solid Waste Management Concepts and methods to safely and effectively manage wastes for all future human space missions are required to perform the following functions: acceptance/collection, transport, storage, processing, disposal, and associated monitoring and control. Actual types and quantities of wastes generated during missions are highly mission dependent. For sizing purposes, however, the ""maximum"" waste streams have been estimated as follows, based on a 6-person crew: trash (0.56 kg/day), food packaging (7.91 kg/day), human fecal wastes (0.72 kg/day dry, 3.0 kg/day wet), inedible plant biomass (2.25 kg/day), paper (1.16 kg/day), tape (0.25 kg/day), filters (0.33 kg/day), water recovery brine concentrates (3.54 kg/day), clothing (3.6 kg/day), and hygiene wipes (1.0 kg/day). Wastes can also be assumed to be source-separated because this requirement has been identified for a majority of waste processing equipment: Microgravity- and hypogravity-compatible solid waste management technologies; Volume reduction of wet and dry solid wastes; Small and compact fecal treatment and/or collection system; Water recovery from wet wastes (including human fecal wastes, food packaging, brines, etc.); Stabilization, sterilization, and/or microbial control technologies to minimize or eliminate biological hazards associated with waste; Storage devices needed for the containment of solid waste that incorporates an odor abatement technology.

Biological and Physical Research,Topic B3 Biomedical and Human Support Research ,B3.07Biomass Production for Planetary Missions, KSC," ARC, JSC","The production of biomass (in the form of edible food crops) in closed or nearly-closed environments is essential for the future of long-term planetary exploration and human settlement in Moon and Mars base applications. These technologies will lead not only to food production, but also to the reclamation of water, purification of air, and recovery of inedible plant resources in the comprehensive exploration of interplanetary regions. Innovations are solicited in the following areas: Crop LightingSources for plant lighting such as, but not limited to, light emitting diodes, high-efficiency lamps or solar collectors suitable for orbital space, interplanetary space, lunar or Martian surface; Transmission and distribution systems for plant lighting including, but not limited to, luminaries, light pipes, fiber optics, and optical filters; and Heat removal techniques for the plant growth lighting such as, but not limited to, water-jackets, water barriers, and wavelength-specific filters and reflectors.

Biological and Physical Research,Topic B3 Biomedical and Human Support Research ,B3.08Software Architectures and Integrated Control Strategies for Advanced Life Support Systems, JSC," ARC, JPL, KSC","The purpose of this subtopic is to develop advanced control system technologies that can support an integrated approach to the command and control of Advanced Life Support (ALS) for future long-duration human space missions, including a permanent human presence on the Moon and Mars. The control strategies for ALS systems must deal with continuous and discrete processes and with dynamic interactions between subsystems such as air revitalization, water recovery, food production, solids processing, and the crew. The goal of autonomously controlling an ALS system challenges many areas of technology, including distributed data management and control, sensor interpretation, planning and scheduling, modeling and simulation, and validation and verification of autonomous control systems. These various technology areas must eventually be integrated into a coherent system that runs day after day for years and that can effectively interact with crewmembers who place their lives in its hands. The control strategy must be able to reach across the system and down into its parts to gather all data necessary to achieve its control objectives. Interfaces to crew, ground control, and other spacecraft systems must allow for insight into control strategies, choices, and pending actions and allow for manual control at any level. The challenges of controlling regenerative life support for an enclosed crew environment involve the ALS goals to minimize expendables, to minimize crew and ground involvement, and to incorporate biological systems for recycling air, water and solids. The interdependence of environmental processing systems, and the need for reducing operations support costs are included. There is a need for the development and evaluation of control architectures and strategies which meet these challenges, both by building on current advances in distributed, modular, object-based protocols, and by new advances in integration of agent technology, planning, and resource management across heterogeneous systems. This includes: New Control Strategies for Closed-Loop Systems Advanced Life Support consists of a combination of physico-chemical systems with biological systems to recycle air, water, solid waste, plants, and food. The system is closed with respect to hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon in order to reduce the amount of consumable air water and food necessary for extended human presence on other planets. Closed systems and biological systems have different constraints and control paradigms than conventional processes. There is a need for new control algorithms, analyses, strategies, and techniques that can accommodate this architecture. Distributed Network Protocols, Including Support for Fieldbus and Intelligent Controllers The robustness of the control and data paths for equipment and subsystems is determined by the fieldbus protocols that connect them. Fieldbus protocols have been developed for the special needs of the aerospace and process control industries. There is a need for investigation and adaptation of these protocols, and the development of new protocols to support the type of distributed intelligent systems and networks envisioned for human exploration missions. These protocols need to be robust and fault-tolerant, and to support a large number of heterogeneous systems. Ideally, these protocols should support both local and interplanetary connectivity. Development of Ontologies for Communication Among Autonomous Systems or Control Agents Human exploration missions involve hundreds of systems developed by dozens of organizations. To develop software that can integrate across these systems and integrate with operations requires the use of common terminology across multiple disciplines. A common taxonomy or common ontology needs to be developed for the types of control problems associated with integrated control of advanced life support systems. Software Development Methodologies for Autonomous Systems This includes requirements management, testing, performance metrics, and long-term maintenance support, including development for growth and support for model-based simulations. There is a need for new tools to support the development of distributed autonomous control systems throughout the program life cycle. This includes tools for managing prototyping, requirements, design, design knowledge capture, testing, and growth and maintenance across multiple development teams. Approaches for Integration of New Controls Technology (both hardware and software) with Existing Legacy Systems Some space technologies are relatively mature. New controls technology must be compatible with legacy fieldbuses and operations concepts in addition to providing new functionality. There is a need for tools and development methodologies that can accommodate growth in system functionality. Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) Across Multiple Systems; Sharing of Parameters and Data Between Heterogeneous Systems The majority of FDIR approaches focuses on single subsystems and depend on a homogeneous platform and software architecture, often using a blackboard or shared memory model to share data between modules. There is a need to perform FDIR across multiple heterogeneous systems across networks. Ideally, FDIR should support cooperative efforts between group operations and planetary systems. Control System Failure Tolerance Critical systems provide functional redundancy in the case of failure or performance degradation. There is a need for new approaches to providing failure tolerance for both hardware and software components of the control systems. Of particular importance is the reduction of crew time for maintenance, and reduction of dependence on re-supplying hardware, as these are the most expensive constraints on these systems. Planning and Scheduling This includes reactions to system faults, supporting adjustments to operations, inventory, and logistics because of planned and unplanned maintenance. There is a need for tools to support development and deployment of applications that support planning and scheduling. Developed applications should support the integration of both planet-side and Earth-side activities. Development and Integration of Autonomous System and Intersystem Control with Crew and Ground Operations There is a need for tools, architectures, and technology that can support integration of operations between crew, ground operators, ground applications, and onboard applications. Development of Architectures that Support a Range of Autonomy, from Fully Autonomous to Fully Manual, with the Corresponding Range of Support for Human Interaction Autonomous systems for human exploration missions must provide visibility, situational awareness, and an ability to change the level of autonomy based on both situation and human input. As unexpected situations arise that are outside the scope of design, autonomous control systems must interact with crew and ground operators at varying levels of transparency. Unlike Earth-based systems, the planet-side crew will not be subsystem experts and may be isolated from ground support. Local systems must safely and robustly aid the crew in both troubleshooting and nominal operations. There is a need for software architectures and development methodologies, including system and crew modeling, to provide such capabilities. Read less>>"

Technologies of specific interest include, but are not limited to, the following:Advanced computer codes are needed to model and predict the transport of radiation through materials. Advanced computer codes are needed to model and predict the effects of radiation on the physiological performance, health, and well-being of humans in space radiation environments. Innovative lightweight radiation shielding materials are needed to shield humans in aerospace transportation vehicles, large space structures such as space stations, orbiters, landers, rovers, habitats, space suits, etc. The materials emphasis should be on non-parasitic radiation shielding materials, or multifunctional materials, where one of the functions is radiation shielding. Non-materials and ""out-of-the-box"" radiation shielding technologies are also of interest. Laboratory and space flight data are needed to validate the accuracy of radiation transport codes. Laboratory and space flight data are needed to validate the effectiveness of radiation-shielding materials and non-materials solutions. Comprehensive radiation-shielding databases and design tools are also sought to enable designers to incorporate and optimize radiation shielding into space systems during the initial design phases.

Space Science,Topic S1 Sun Earth Connection ,S1.02Deep Space Propulsion, MSFC," GRC, GSFC, JSC","Spacecraft propulsion technology innovations are sought for upcoming deep space science missions. Propulsion system functions for these missions include primary propulsion, maneuvering, planetary injection, and planetary descent and ascent. Innovations are needed to reduce spacecraft propulsion system mass, volume, and/or cost. Applicable propulsion technologies include solar electric, chemical and thermal, solar sails, aeroassist and aerocapture and emerging technologies. Solar Electric Propulsion Innovations in electric propulsion system technologies are being sought for space science applications. One area of emphasis pertains to high-performance propulsion systems capable of delivering specific impulse (Isp) greater than 2000 s, using electrical power from radioisotope or solar energy sources. Thruster technologies include, but are not limited to, ion engines, Hall thrusters, and pulsed electromagnetic devices. Other areas of interest include propellant storage, direct drive and other innovative power processing, power management and distribution, heat-to-electrical power conversion, and waste heat disposal. Innovations considered here may focus on the component, subsystem or system level, and must ultimately result in significant improvements in spacecraft capability, longevity, mass, volume, and/or cost. Solar Sails Solar sails are envisioned as a low-cost, efficient transport system for future near-Earth and deep space missions. NASA mission's enabled and enhanced by solar sail propulsion include Tech Pull Missions such as Geotail, Comet Sample and Titan Flyby all to be launched between 2009 and 2012. Another category of NASA missions is the Particle Acceleration Solar Orbiter, including the L1-Diamond and the Solar Polar Imager, both to be launched between 2015 and 2028. Solar Sails are enabling for several strategic missions in the Sun-Earth Connection Space Science theme, including Solar Polar Imager and Interstellar Probe, the latter being a sail mission to explore interstellar space. Missions in the Exploration of the Solar System theme would be broadly enhanced by the availability of proven sail technology. Innovations are sought that will lower the cost and risk associated with sail development and application, and enhance sail delivery performance. Innovations are sought in the following areas: systems engineering, materials, structures, mechanical systems, fabrication, packaging and deployment, system control (attitude, etc.), maneuvering and navigation, operations, durability and survivability, and sail impact on science. Development of ultra-lightweight inflatable and deployable support structures is of significant interest, including rigidization approaches. Innovations in ultra-light reflective thin films are also sought. Three parameters have been used as sail performance metrics in mission applications: sail size, sail survivability for close solar approaches, and areal density (ratio of mass of the sail to area of the sail). In addition, important programmatic metrics are cost, benefit, and risk. Technologies of interest should be geared toward a wide range of sail sizes, solar closest approach distances, and aerial densities, and may be optimized for one portion of the range rather than trying to cover the whole range. Sail sizes may range from very small (meter-sized for use with very tiny picosat payloads or for use as auxiliary propulsion), to medium (50100 m size for achieving high-inclination solar orbits or non-Keplerian near-Earth orbits) and ultimately to the very large (hundreds of meters for levitated orbits, high delta V, and for use in leaving the Solar System at high speed). Sail weight should include, but not be limited to, ultra-lightweight sail materials ( Chemical and Thermal Propulsion Innovations in low-thrust chemical propulsion system technologies are being sought for Space Science missions applications. One area of interest is a bipropellant engine with Isp greater than 360 s. Component, subsystem, or system level technology development will be considered but work must ultimately result in significant reductions in spacecraft system mass, volume, and/or cost. Other areas to be considered include lightweight, compact and low-power propellant management components, such as valves, flow control/regulation, fluid isolation, dependable ignition systems, and lightweight tankage. Aeroassist Aeroassist is a general term given to various techniques to maneuver a space vehicle within an atmosphere, using aerodynamic forces in lieu of propulsion fuel. Aeroassist systems enable shorter interplanetary cruise times, increased payload mass, and reduced mission costs. Subsets of aeroassist are aerocapture and aerogravity assist. Aerocapture relies on the exchange of momentum with an atmosphere to achieve a decelerating thrust leading to orbit capture. This technique permits spacecraft to be launched from Earth at higher velocities, thus providing a shorter overall trip time. At the destination, the velocity is reduced by aerodynamic drag within the atmosphere. Without aerocapture, a substantial propulsion system would be needed on the spacecraft to perform the same reduction of velocity. Aerogravity assist is an extension of the established technique of gravity assist with a planetary body to achieve increases in interplanetary velocities. Aerogravity assist involves using propulsion in conjunction with aerodynamics through a planetary atmosphere to achieve a greater turning angle during planetary fly-by. In particular, this subtopic seeks technology innovations that are in the following areas: Aerocapture Thermal Protection Systems: Development of advanced thermal protection systems and insulators. Materials need high strength (modulus in the tens of GPa) and very low density (tens of kg/m3). Improvements needed in materials include having highly anisotropic thermal properties, i.e., high thermal diffusivity tangential to the spacecraft shape and low thermal diffusivity normal to the spacecraft shape. Sensors for Inflatable Decelerators: Health monitoring method for inflatable thin film systems. Analytical Tools: Development of advanced tools to perform coupled aeroelastic and aerothermal analysis of inflatable decelerator systems. Aerogravity Assist Aerogravity Assist Technology Analysis: Research advancements in leading edge materials and provide CFD analysis of heating environment for aerogravity assist maneuvers at a small planet (e.g., Venus). Emerging Propulsion Technologies This effort will focus on technologies supporting innovative and advanced concepts for propellantless propulsion and other revolutionary transportation technologies. The categories under Emerging Propulsion Technologies include, but are not limited to: electrodynamic and momentum-exchange tether propulsion, beamed energy, ultra-light solar sails, bimodal sails, and low to medium power electric propulsion (including pulse inductive devices). The electrodynamic tether propulsion uses electromagnetic interaction with a planetary magnetic field to exchange angular momentum . Momentum exchange tethers (such as the MXER tether concept use a strong tether to transfer angular momentum and orbital energy to a payload. Beamed energy propulsion concepts include lasers or microwave energy to directly propel a spacecraft or to supply power that is utilized for propulsion onboard the spacecraft. Ultra-light or bimodal sail propulsion developing conventional solar sails into extremely high-performing systems. The low to medium electric propulsion is a general category for fresh variations of electric thrusters (Hall, MHD, PIT, etc.) that support near or mid-term solar powered spacecraft (e.g., below ~50 kW). Unique, innovative and novel propulsion ideas are sought but with reasonable expectations to progress to hardware prototypes. The concept must be above TRL 2 with rapid demonstration to TRL 4 expected. Distinctive variations of existing propulsion methods or chief subsystem component improvements are also suitable for submission. Proposals should provide development of specific innovative technologies or techniques supporting any of the above approaches. A clear plan for demonstrating feasibility, noting any test and experiment requirements, is also recommended. Key to each idea is an unambiguous knowledge of past research and concepts conducted on related work, and specifically, how this new proposal differs to the extent that it appears to offer a significant benefit. Identification of the fundamental technology to be developed is also crucial. Read less>>"

The success of such investigations will largely depend on the technology building blocks that are needed to implement multiple spacecraft constellations with extremely precise laser interferometers and test masses which are actively decoupled from systematic and random disturbances. The technology areas are organized into two subsystems, one dealing with the disturbance rejection subsystem, which houses the proof mass with active sensors and thrusters to cancel non-gravity wave disturbances, and the other implementing the network of laser interferometers with nanometer-level resolution of relative range between the test masses. Because the systems will be deployed in space, the technologies to be considered must be, or have, credible paths toward full space flight qualification, including thermal and radiation considerations. Background information on LISA, along with preliminary technology discussions, can be found in the proceedings of the 4th International LISA Symposium, Penn State University, 1924 July 2002, published in the Classical and Quantum Gravity Journal, Volume 20, Number 10, 21 May 2003.

Space Science,Topic S3 Astronomical Search for Origins ,S3.01Precision Constellations for Interferometry, JPL, GSFC,"This subtopic seeks hardware and software technologies necessary to establish, maintain and operate hyper- precision spacecraft constellations to a level that enables separated spacecraft optical interferometry. Also sought are technologies for analysis, modeling, and visualization of such constellations. In a constellation for large effective telescope apertures, multiple, collaborative spacecraft in a precision formation collectively form a variable-baseline interferometer. These formations require the capability for autonomous precision alignment and synchronized maneuvers, reconfigurations, and collision avoidance. It is important that, in order to enable precision spacecraft formation keeping from coarse requirements (relative position control of any two spacecraft to less than 1 cm, and relative bearing of 1 arcmin over target range of separations from a few meters to tens of kilometers) to fine requirements (micron relative position control and relative bearing control of 0.1 arcsec), the interferometer payload would still need to provide at least 13 orders of magnitude improvement on top of the S/C control requirements. The spacecraft also require onboard capability for optimal path planning, and time optimal maneuver design and execution. Innovations that address the above precision requirements are solicited for distributed constellation systems in the following areas:Integrated optical/formation/control simulation tools; Distributed, multitiming, high fidelity simulations; Formation modeling techniques; Precision guidance and control architectures and design methodologies; Centralized and decentralized formation estimation; Distributed sensor fusion; RF and optical precision metrology systems; Formation sensors; Precision microthrusters/actuators; Autonomous reconfigurable formation techniques; Optimal, synchronized, maneuver design methodologies; Collision avoidance mechanisms; Formation management and station keeping; and Six degrees of freedom precision formation testbeds.

Space Science,Topic S3 Astronomical Search for Origins ,S3.02High Contrast Astrophysical Imaging, JPL, ARC,"This subtopic addresses the unique problem of imaging and spectroscopic characterization of faint astrophysical objects that are located within the obscuring glare of much brighter stellar sources. Examples include planetary systems beyond our own and the detailed inner structure of galaxies with very bright nuclei. Contrast ratios of one million to one billion over an angular spatial scale of 0.051.5 arcsec are typical of these objects. Achieving a very low background against which to detect a planet, requires control of both scattered and diffracted light.

The performance and observing efficiency of these instruments, however, must be greatly enhanced. The instrument components are expected to offer much higher optical throughput, larger fields of view, and better detector performance. The wavelengths of primary interest extend from the visible to the thermal infrared. Measurement techniques include imaging, photometry, spectroscopy, coronography, and polarimetry.

Space Science,Topic S4 Exploration of the Solar System ,S4.05Astrobiology, ARC, JPL,"Astrobiology includes the study of the origin, evolution, and distribution of life in the universe. New technologies are required to enable the search for extant or extinct life elsewhere in the solar system, to obtain an organic history of planetary bodies, to discover and explore water sources elsewhere in the solar system, and to detect microorganisms and biologically important molecular structures within complex chemical mixtures. Biomarkers produced by microbial communities are profoundly affected by internal biogeochemical cycling. The small spatial scales at which these biogeochemical processes operate necessitate measurements made using microsensors. The search for life on other planetary bodies will also require systems capable of moving and deploying instruments across, and through, varied terrain to access biologically important environments. A second element of Astrobiology is the understanding of the evolutionary development of biological processes leading from single-cell organisms to multi-cell specimens and to complex ecological systems over multiple generations. Understanding of the effects of radiation and gravity on lower organisms, plants, humans and other animals (as well as elucidation of the basic mechanisms by which these effects occur) will be of direct benefit to the quality of life on Earth. These benefits will occur through applications in medicine, agriculture, industrial biotechnology, environmental management, and other activities dependent on understanding biological processes over multiple generations.

Optical CommunicationsEfficient (greater than 20% wall plug), lightweight, flight-qualifiable, variable repetition-rate (160 MHz), pulsed lasers with greater than 1 kW of peak power per pulse (over the entire pulse-repetition rate), and potential for up to 10 W of average power. Photon counting 1064 nm and 1550 nm detectors with the gain greater than 1000, detection efficiency greater than 50%, very low additive noise, about 0.5 mm in diameter, bandwidth greater than 500 MHz, saturation levels > 50Mcounts/s. Lightweight, compact, high precision (less than 0.1 micro-radian), high bandwidth (02kHz), inertial reference sensors (angle sensors, gyros) for use onboard spacecraft. Novel schemes for stray-light control and sunlight mitigation, especially for large (> 5 m) ground-based optical antennae that must operate when pointed to within a few (about 3) degrees of the Sun. Low-cost, lightweight, efficient, compact, high precision (one micro-radian accuracy) star-trackers for spaceflight application.Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II hardware and software demonstration, and that will, when possible, deliver a demonstration unit or software package for JPL testing before completion of the Phase II contract.Read less>>"

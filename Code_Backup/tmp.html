The system utilizes an array of \npulsed jet actuators near the blade leading edge to control unsteady lift\nand flow separation during transient pitch-up. The ability to control these \nprocesses will alleviate problems which currently limit rotary-wing vehicle \nperformance. The control system, which has previously been tested at\nlow-speed, will be refined and tested on a small-scale rotor blade section \nmounted in a transonic wind tunnel at Ohio State University. The ability to \ncontrol and delay dynamic stall events during oscillatory pitching of \nthe model will be evaluated in open-loop experiments. Results from the tests \nwill be used to develop parametric scaling laws to aid in designing an actuator \nsystem for full-scale rotors. The experimental results will be used as \nguidelines for the design of a Phase II prototype control system for large-scale \ntesting at flight conditions. \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n</P><P>\n<B><b>POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</b></B>\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n  The performance of both commercial and military rotorcraft will be enhanced through the application of the proposed control system. The system will alleviate rotor blade stall which currently limits high-speed forward flightand produces excessive noise in certain flight regimes. The successful development and application of this control system will result in the design of more versatile and quiet rotorcraft and VSTOL vehicles. \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n \n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n</P><P>\n<B><b>NAME AND ADDRESS OF PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</b></B>\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n<pre><b> \nKeith R.

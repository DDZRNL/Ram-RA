Smith,,"424 Hwy 12 W, Starkville , MS  39759 - 3635",,,,,,,,"The goal of the proposed NASA SBIR project is to design, develop, FAA certify, and manufacture an integrated aero/acoustic improvement to propeller driven General Aviation airplanes to reduce cabin and community noise and increase propulsive efficiency and fuel economy. The elements of the integrated propulsion system improvement include (1) modifying the engine cowl to be more axisymmetric to reduce propeller/cowl interference noise, (2) extending and aerodynamically refining the forward portion of the cowl to reduce the amount of acoustic disturbance caused by the cowl, (3) employing a modern propeller design to reduce susceptibility to inflow distortion, and (4) modifying the wind screen configuration to reduce separated flow that causes cabin broadband noise. Recent public surveys by the NASA AGATE Program have revealed that cabin noise and airframe vibration are two of the largest detriments to public acceptance of GA aircraft for transportation. The proposed project is consistent with the objectives of RFP Topic 02 to effect dramatic reductions in light aircraft reduce community noise by 10 EPNdB within ten years and to reduce cabin noise to increase passenger comfort. It is also consistent with the NASA Acoustics Program, the goals of the NASA AGATE Program, and the proposed NASA Small Airplane Transportation System (SATS).",,The direct commercial potential for the proposed project is the manufacture and sale of: · A general aviation airplane incorporating the proposed aero/acoustic technology. · Production and sale of improved engine cowls to existing aircraft owners. · Production and sale of improved engine cowls to other light aircraft manufacturers. Global Aircraft Corporation is currently certifying its GT-3 Trainer airplane under FAA Part 23 Regulations. The Company is in the process of starting production of a revolutionary new composite propeller that has been developed under the NASA SBIR Program. The Company currently has available funding to construct the initial production facility by November 1999. Global has adequate financial reserves in the current credit facility to finance production of the Aero/Acoustic Cowl to be developed and FAA certified in Phase II. The proposed aero/acoustic cowl will be complimentary to the Quasi-Constant Speed Composite Propeller developed by the Company and currently starting production. The combined noise reduction of the propeller (5-8 dBA) and the aero/acoustic cowl will produce significant noise reduction in both community noise and cabin noise and should be well received by aircraft owners and the general public.

The gashopper will first retrieve CO2 gas from the local Martian environment, compressing it with a pump to store it in liquid form at a pressure of about 10 bar. When enough CO2 is stored to make a substantial ballistic trajectory hop to another Mars site location of interest, the CO2 propellant will then be moderately heated to form a very high pressure supercritical gas which is then expanded through a simple rocket thruster system. An alternative gashopper concept uses liquified CO2 which is passed through a heated particle bed heat exchanger which heats and gasifies the CO2 for propulsion. The gashopper shall use its CO2 propulsion system for major liftoff, attitude control, and landing propulsive burn(s), as required. Unlike chemical rocket propellants, the gashopper's CO2 propulsion system will not contaminate the landing site with organic molecules or water. Thus, this Mars surface exploration system is uniquely appropriate for astrobiological research. Inthis study, Pioneer Astronautics proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of the gashopper concept.",,"the gashopper concept is primarily designed to enable greatly enhanced mobility for robotic Mars exploration vehicles. However the gashopper CO2 rocket system (CRS) has many potential important commercial applications for application in the space. Currently there is a spectacular boom in the commercial satellite market supporting global communications. Small CRS thrusters could be used for stationkeeping and reaction control system (RCS) propulsion for satellites. Currently the propellant of choice for such applications is monopropellant hydrazine, which is toxic, dangerous, expensive, and offers a rather low performance (Isp=220 s). CRS based propulsion systems will be much cheaper, safer, and easier to integrate than hydrazine, and while offering comparable specific impulse performance. There likely could be a substantial reduction in launch system processing servicing cost for a CRS when compared to a state-of-the-art hydrazine RCS. Thus, development of a gashopper CRS technology could result in a major cost saving to the commercial industry."

This lack of pressure measurement accuracy vs time curtails hypersonic wind tunnel effectiveness for creating accurate design models for avionics. While manufacturers make fine cameras for many cientific applications, pressure sensitive paint, a flourescent technology, puts unusual constraints on the camera. Shot noise, caused by the limited number of photons that a CCD camera can process per frame, is the issue. The lourescent photons produced by the PSP are inversely proportional to the pressure. Accuracy is worse where you ant it most, at high pressures. The optimum solution for reduced noise is to gather more photons (signal). Of the hree ways to do this, 1.a brighter light source will destroy the paint. 2. Frame-frame addition lowers effective uantum efficiency and is too slow. 3.

In Phase I, an accurate and efficient radiation model will be developed to simulate radiative heat transfer in the gas enclosure as well as inside the fiberglass. The Navier-Stokes equations will be solved for both glass and external gas, which are coupled by the conjugate boundary conditions at the interface. The multizone adaptive grid generation (MAGG) technique will be used to discretize the physical domain due to its high quality characteristics for free-surface problems.

Plant supports of interest include seed plugs, seeding mats, root/shoot barriers, and plant ""fences"". The innovation is to develop totally regenerable plant structures that retain sufficient structural integrity for plant support over one crop cycle, that can be fabricated on-site, are non-toxic to plants, and which do not require separation from the inedible plant waste stream. By forming expendable components from inedible plant material already in the ALS system, resupply mass can be significantly reduced (an annual supply of non-regenerable seed plugs is about 124 to 3000 kg depending on the type). Harvesting procedures would be simplified since support structures would be processed directly as part of the inedible waste stream. The use of regenerable seed plugs would also reduce crew time, and simplify the mechanization of seeding and harvesting processes. Proposal tasks involve processing plant fibers, fabrication of prototypes, and mechanical and biocompatibility testing of the prototype regenerable seed plugs. The anticipated result of this project is a process and associated technology to produce regenerable plant supports meeting ALS operational requirements.",,"NASA Related Applications-The near term application of this technology is in ALS testbed plant growing systems. One testbed, the BioPlex facility at JSC, will have 90m2 of crop growing area with the potential to produce several crop cycles per year at high planting densities. Incorporation of an in-situ regenerable plant support production capability would increase testbed fidelity in addition to providing cost savings over the use of non-regenerable materials, reducing labor required for harvesting and waste processing operations, and simplifying integration with mechanized harvesting. The ultimate end use of this technology would be as a component of a space based ALS. Commercial Markets-Seed support structures from agricultural fibers may be competitive with plant support structures currently fabricated from non-renewable materials (e.g. peat-moss, rockwool, or plastic). This has occurred to some degree in the area of landscape fabrics, with agri-fiber materials replacing some non-renewable materials previously used.

Moving a portion of the full power heat addition from the main combustor to the turbine burner reduces peak flame temperature which can drastically reduce NOx emissions and improve turbine life.

Some of the general capabilities of the Internet accessible AUTO-FUR include: - Automatic scheduling of a given event.- Conflict resolution between simultaneously scheduled events. - Integration with a flexible, patented inventory database. - Validation of the requested event with the inventory database. - Automatic learning of user preferences. - Intelligent substitution of unavailable items. This technology can be applied to other applications that require a set of inventory for a given class or event. Examples of which include trade show scheduling, shipping scheduling, and general class scheduling. Since AUTO-FUR is completely database driven, the event does not need to be a training class. By simply changing the data in the database, the event can be a totally different activity requiring the same general capabilities described above. The dynamic nature of the inventory database (THMS) allows virtually any type of inventory to be easily represented in the database."

We have an available solution that combines new technology with an old concept  ""Project Orion"". The proposed ""MagOrion"" Propulsion System combines a magnetic sail (MagSail) with conventional small yield (0.5 to 1.0 kiloton) shaped nuclear fission devices. At detonation, roughly eighty percent of the yield appears as a highly-ionized plasma, and when detonated two kilometers behind a robust MagSail, approximately half of this plasma can be stopped and turned into thrust. A MagOrion can provide a system acceleration of one or more gravities with effective specific impulses ranging from 15,000 to 45,000 seconds. Dana Andrews and Robert Zubrin published a paper in 1997 that described the operating principles of the MagOrion. We have taken that concept through conceptual design to identify the major operational features and risks. During Phase I of the SBIR, we will quantify the system risks and establish either solutions or areas for risk mitigating demonstrations. The risks are considerable, but the potential payoff is staggering. Our proposed MagOrion will enable affordable exploration of the solar system.",,"Our MagOrion design is capable of delivering 100 metric tons to either Mars in 65 days or Jupiter in one year. It's high performance makes it the ideal choice as a reusable planetary space ""freighter"" to support human exploration of the solar system, development of scientific outposts, and even colonization. No other near term propulsion system, including Nuclear Thermal and Ion, can come close to matching the MagOrion's 20,000 seconds of specific impulse and half-million pounds of thrust. As we enter the third millennium, NASA has its sights set on Mars and destinations beyond. The MagOrion, which could be operating before the next decade is out, will enable NASA to cost effectively send human explorers to the primary planetary bodies of our solar system and establish bases on scientifically rich areas such as Mars and Europa. Where as the Space Shuttle is an Earth to orbit space taxi, the MagOrion is a planet to planet heavy lift space ""freighter"". Although the initial MagOrion customer is NASA, as humans turn to exploit space for its natural resources and entertainment potential, the low operating costs of the MagOrion (estimated at two thousand dollars per pound), could enable commercial ventures on other planets or moons."

While weight is not a restriction, reliability, cost, safety and performance are important. In particular, long-life, liquid-oxygen-compatible seal technology is essential to reduce recurring costs and provide personnel/equipment safety. A new material surfacing process, Laser Induced Surface Improvement (LISIsm), has demonstrated technical properties that make it promising for this application. The patent-pending surface alloying process permits a wide variety of metal and/or ceramic ingredients to be incorporated in a thin surface coating on component metals of interest. LISIsm forms unique non-equilibrium alloys with enhanced properties; i.e., properties not possible in bulk materials. The surface is permanent; i.e., cannot be separated via physical abuse or thermal cycling. The surface alloy can contain constituents that make it less susceptible to liquid oxygen, yet have hardness as required to protect from particulate scratching. Other research has focused on the process to make sealing surfaces softer (for better sealing) and to protect Inconnel from hydrogen embrittlement. Phase I will experiment with designated surface additives to substrate materials of interest. Phase II will extend these results to real hardware which can be tested in an operating environment.",,"Ground-based transfer systems for cryogenic fluids is a big business, both for the U.S. Government and commercial interests. In particular, the production of liquid-oxygen-compatible components which are not scratch-sensitive and are longer lasting can make LISIsm surface alloying a necessary part of production. This technology will permit safer, more reliable and probably less-costly components. High-pressure air systems may also benefit from the research.

The device is unique because it operates without using consumable chemicals carried on board or resupplied from earth. The disinfectant that is generated acts against a broad range of potentially pathogenic microorganisms and it is generally safe to apply directly to foods. The disinfectant can also be externally applied to utensils, food preparation surfaces and processing equipment and there are no harmful wastes produced that could impact an integrated bioregenerative system. The proposal includes preliminary test results demonstrating the device's operating characteristics. The aim of Phase I is to demostrate the method's feasibility as a food sanitizing agent. The long-term goal is to provide sanitation hardware to NASA for use in food processing.",,Food borne illness is one of the most serious public health problems facing the United States. Food poising accounts for thousands of deaths each year and the estimated cost to the Nation is between billion and billion annually. The food sanitation equipment described in this proposal could be used in industrial and commercial food establishments to minimize the risks associated with contaminated food.

This approach makes parallel, multi-corporation design inefficient. Additionally, although CAD systems support finite element analysis, this capability usually does not support coupled multidisciplinary, multiple level-of-fidelity analysis models, and so significant effort is expended preparing models for analysis.

The inflatable nature of our innovation makes it lightweight, allowing it to be deflated so it takes up less volume during transportation and storage.

As a stationary aeroponic system, these existing high-mass units perform very well, but transporting and storing them can be problematic. On Earth, these problems may hinder the economic feasibility of aeroponics for commercial growers. However, such problems become insurmountable obstacles for using these systems on long-duration space missions because of the high cost of payload volume and mass during launch and transit.

The transportability of the inflatable system makes it ideally suited for missions where traveling light is key and water resources are limited. One of the prime benefits of aeroponic plant growth is its improved method for starting a crop. In an enclosed environment where environmental parameters can be optimized the reliance on seeds could be eliminated and replaced with vegetative propagation as a means to start a crop. Vegetative propagation could be used as an extremely efficient methodology, which would minimize labor and time. Utilizing an enclosed aeroponic system as method and apparatus in conjunction with vegetative propagation could reduce the reliance on seeds as well as eliminate the need for extensive tissue culture procedures and hardware.

Therefore, substantial technology and sub-system improvement is required for providing high electrical-to-optical efficiency and better system performance. Princeton Electronic Systems, Inc. (PES), has a strong background on high power VCSELs and diode pumped solid state lasers, proposes to develop a novel Yb:YAG based laser transmitter based on high power, two dimensional coherently coupled VCSEL arrays providing unparalleled performance including high power (100mW-10W+ CW, 2-1000W+ pulsed), low divergence Gaussian beam outputs, single mode operation. In addition, PES will develop microlens arrays which will allow the outputs of many VCSEL arrays to be combined effectively for very high power applications (2000W+ range or more). In phase I of this program, PES proposes to demonstrate a highly efficient, extremely compact DPSS laser transmitter with 100 mW-2 W output power in the wavelength region of 1029 nm. PES will fabricate the high power VCSELs and develop micro-lens arrays in phase I using the already developed technology and couple them for DPSS longitudinal pumping. PES plans to commercialize the laser system immediately after development.",,"A high performance VCSEL pumped Yb:YAG laser can be used for many commercial applications including laser lidar based remote sensing, military open field communications, medical diagnostics and treatment, laser spectroscopy, and a range of other emerging applications."

Haase,,"22 Duggan Road, PO Box 733, Acton , MA  01720 - 0011",,,,,,,,Prevention of catastrophic failure of engine components is a major goal to the subtopic. Catastrophic failures of turbine engines are often caused by vibration-induced compressor and fan blade fatigue fractures. Existing capacitance systems have been unable to accurately measure blade vibration due to limited spatial resolution and limited system bandwidth. The proposed effort will develop a new capacitive system with significantly higher spatial resolution and wider bandwidth to provide high-accuracy time-of-arrival measurements for computing blade vibration. Successful demonstration of feasibility of the capacitive probe and electronics will lead to development of monitoring systems suitable for use on new engines as well as for retrofit on existing engines. The ability to detect excessibe blade vibration in flight will allow the pilot to change the engine operating parameters and thus prevent the occurrence of safety-significant blade fractures.,,Blade vibration monitoring of aircraft engines will involve the following applications: 1. Spin pit tests during engine development 2. Test engines during engine development 3. Production test equipment for engine manufacturing 4. Engine monitoring on flight engines 5. Engine monitoring and active clearance control on flight engines The last step combines the blade vibration monitoring with blade tip clearance measurement for use in a control system to dynamically adjust the tip clearance to achieve optimum engine performance.

Hoyt,,"9621 Camino del Sol NE, Albuquerque , NM 87111 - 1522",,,,,,,,"A new, photoconductive polymer system based on silylene-silicone copolymers is proposed for evaluation as a base resin for spacecraft coating materials. These coatings can be tailored to provide low solar absorbance, high emissivity at ambient spacecraft surface temperature, atomic oxygen resistance, and resistance to surface charging by ion and electron impact. The coatings are tough, abrasion resistant, 100% solids formulations; no solvents are required. Cure of the coating is initiated by irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) light, which allows cure control that is independent of temperature and provides long shelf life. Our approach to the formulation of spacecraft coatings will involve the synthesis of a curable resin containing polysilylene chains. We believe that polysilylene chains terminated with epoxy substituted polysiloxanes (silicones) afford the most viable route to a curable system. We will use the established photoconductivity of the polysilylene fragments to achieve an illuminated (light or ionizing radiation) conductivity for neutralizing deposited charge and their reactivity toward atomic oxygen to provide erosion protection. Polysilylenes form monolayers of silica during attack, which can effectively block further reaction. We propose to fill these systems, at or below the percolation limit with glass particles that are coated with a conductive indium/tin oxide layer to tailor their absorbtivity and emissivity and to provide the surfaces for generation of free-charge carriers. Previous work at Adherent Technologies has resulted in polysilylenes that have reactive ends capable of copolymerization with epoxy-terminated siloxane oligomers to form crosslinkable resin systems. Suitable tailoring of these copolymers should give liquid, ultraviolet light curable resins that can be the basis of solvent-free coating systems.",,"Initial applications will be in government-sponsored space and communications programs. However, the materials should find niche markets in areas where high temperature stability, corrosion resistance, and shielding or static discharge mitigation are required.

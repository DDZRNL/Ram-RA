X-COR Therapeutics is creating the first extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R) device that uses
dialysis-like approaches to accessibly treat hypercapnic respiratory failure (HRF) patients. HRF is a
devastating consequence of critical lung disease caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
and other respiratory disorders including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a common complication
of COVID-19. The current standard of care for severe disease is invasive mechanical ventilation, which results
in a ~30% mortality rate and increased susceptibility to ARDS. While use of protective ventilatory strategies
reduces mortality, resultant hypercapnia from protective ventilation resembles diseases like COPD. In both
cases, impaired ventilation causes increased carbon dioxide (CO2) levels that lead to acidosis, coma, and
death. For patients with hypercapnia, extracorporeal technologies that deliver oxygen and remove gaseous
CO2 (e.g. ECMO) present possible alternatives but are highly invasive and costly. They require high blood flow
rates (andgt;1 L/min) and large-bore cannula only deployable in specialized facilities.
Here, we propose investigating a hybrid device that resembles a hemodialysis-like blood filtration cartridge that
contains a novel configuration of two filtration fibers for bicarbonate dialysis and gaseous CO2 capture. High
efficiency CO2 removal allows a low blood rate of andlt;250 ml/min, thus allowing small catheters (andlt;13.5 Fr) to
replace the 28-30 Fr cannula used today in most extracorporeal therapies. Less invasive and standard
vascular access makes this therapy accessible and enables its use in parallel with invasive mechanical
ventilation. With parallel therapy, the proposed device can prevent hypercapnia that results from protective
ventilation and enable safer use of invasive mechanical ventilation with earlier extubation. Because it can use
existing hemodialysis systems, the device can be deployed with existing workflows and capital equipment.
The objective of this Phase I SBIR project is to optimize and then investigate ventilatory benefits from using a
hybrid membrane filtration device that removes CO2 from ultra-low extracorporeal blood flow. Aim 1 is to
determine optimal device geometries and operating parameters (e.g. size, fiber pack density, and fiber ratio)
that meet desired CO2 capture requirements through iterative modification of a novel design using scalable
production methods. Each iteration will be evaluated using bench-top ex-vivo perfusion testing. Aim 2 is to
investigate the impact that extracorporeal CO2 capture has on patient spontaneous and assisted ventilatory
requirements using a series of physiologic computational models using patient-specific boundary conditions.
Successful completion of this project will result in a manufacture-ready device with candidate geometries and
operating parameters for pre-clinical testing. This device will be able to: 1) remove andgt;30% of CO2 produced; 2)
be produced using scalable manufacturing; and 3) be interoperable with existing hemodialysis platforms. This
is a critical step for advancing toward future pre-clinical and clinical studies in support of FDA approval.PROJECT RELEVANCE
The proposed device and methodology meet a critical unmet need for a safer, more accessible treatment that
removes carbon dioxide from the blood of patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure (HRF) resulting from
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or complications during treatment of severe COVID-19. Current
treatment methods rely on invasive mechanical ventilation that require resource-heavy intensive care unit
hospitalizations and can potentially further damage the lungs. This proposal investigates a novel approach for
carbon dioxide removal in a system that is comparable to hemodialysis instead of more invasive systems like
ECMO, allowing use of safer ventilatory protocols and shortening intensive care unit stays."

ELLIS,,(919) 619-0388,gepardieu@aol.com,Stub,,,,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ABSTRACT Interruption and subsequent restoration of circulation in tissues causes varying amounts of ischemia- reperfusion injury (IRI). IRI is a detrimental feature of many clinical events such as organ transplants, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) used in cardiac surgery, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. There is currently no effective therapy to prevent or reduce IRI. This proposal focuses on cerebral IRI, a significant clinical problem contributing to considerable morbidity and large numbers of deaths. When an artery is occluded, there is an area of tissue that is deprived of oxygen and nutrients, leading to necrosis and infarction. However, there is a large border zone around the infarction that does not get sufficient circulation to function normally, but enough to survive. This area at risk (AAR), known in the brain as the penumbra, experiences IRI, even without acute restoration of circulation. IRI is associated with early increased endothelial permeabilityand edema and later, changes in gene expression, resulting in inflammation. There is growing awareness of the vital role played by the innate immune system in IRI. The innate immune system is comprised of extracellular and intracellular receptors that activate multiple signaling molecules controlling gene transcription leading to an inflammatory phenotype. This very complex system evolved over 700 million years to protect uni- and multi- cellular organisms from infection with bacteria, fungi, viruses and other pathogens. Involvement of the innate immune system in IRI is puzzling - there is no infection, although there is tissue damage due to infarction that is misinterpreted by the receptors of the innate immune system as infection. This concept - that IRI is a biologic mistake - is the basis of X-In8 Biologicals Corp. Inhibiting activation of the innate immune system temporarily may have a profound impact on IRI and dramatically reduce the size of the penumbra, resulting in much less tissue damage and smaller strokes. Our research has implicated TLR4 as a mediator of lung edema and inflammation due to lung IRI. Thus, we are proposing to test CRX-526, a potent TLR4 inhibitor, for efficacy to prevent and/or reduce cerebral IRI. Our initial target applications are prevention of IRI during stroke and treatment of acute cerebral artery occlusion. However, because the innate immune system is involved in the delayed phase of IRI, therapeutic intervention soon after a stroke may be highly beneficial as well. Beyond cerebral IRI, any successful therapy to reduce IRI would have a profound impact on organ transplantation, myocardial damage due to CPB, and the natural history and treatment for MI and stroke.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major problem in many clinical scenarios, including organ transplantation, myocardial infarction, and stroke. When a cerebral artery is occluded due to embolic stroke, inflammation and edema due to IRI is responsible for a large amount of neuronal cell death in the penumbrum, a large zone around the infarcted area. Because toll-like receptors (TLRs) of the innate immune system, particularly TLR4 and TLR2, mediate much of the inflammation associated with IRI in many organs, including the brain, this proposal outlines novel experiments to determine the impact of inhibiting TLR4 activation with a potent TLR4 inhibitor, that appears to have some inhibitory effects on TLR2 in endothelial cells, through collaboration of a university-based expert in cerebral IRI, and X-In8, a new biotechnology company with a novel concept about IRI. In Phase I we propose to evaluate the impact of TLR4 inhibition using an established in vivo model of brain IRI, and proven methods to quantify edema due to brain IRI. When wedetermine a benefit of TLR4 inhibition in this model, in Phase 2 we propose to determine efficacy of this approach in translational small and large animal models of stroke and acute interventions to restore circulation to ischemic areas of brain."

This leads to a series of biologic consequences, resulting in edema and inflammation. IRI is a significant problem in organ transplantation, because IRI is the major cause of primary graft failure and organ dysfunction after transplant. IRI is also a major problem in many clinical scenarios, including cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) used in cardiac surgery, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. There are currently no effective therapies to prevent or reduce IRI. Graft injury due to IRI at the time of implantation is now recognized as a major contributor to delayed graft dysfunction, also known as chronic rejection. Lung transplantation (LTX) has extended and improved the lives of thousands of patients with end-stage lung disease, but is severely constrained by an inadequate supply of suitable donors from conventional organ donors (brain-dead, ventilated patients whose organs are retrieved after controlled cardiac arrest). Among solid organs transplanted, lungs have one of the highest rates of acute graft failure, and the highest incidence of late graft failure. Hundreds of transplant candidates die every year before receiving LTX, and thousands of others are not even considered candidates because of the lung donor shortage. If lungs could be retrieved from non-heart-beating donors (NHBDs) - victims of sudden death - at intervals after circulatory arrest and transplanted safely, the shortage of lungs for transplant could be eliminated, and the lives of thousands more patients with end-stage lung disease could be extended or enhanced by LTX. Transplant using lungs retrieved from NHBDs is also associated with IRI. Any therapy to reduce lung IRI would have significant clinical impact; it could improve both short- and long-term results of conventional LTX, and it could facilitate LTX from NHBDs. In addition, reducing IRI in other organs would have far-reaching implications in organ transplantation and in CPB, MI, and stroke. We have identified receptors and effector pathways of the innate immune system as important contributors to inflammation due to IRI. Among these, there is growing evidence from our group and others that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a critical contributor to IRI in transplant and to other IRI models. The purpose of the Phase I STTR is to determine if CRX-526, a TLR4 inhibitor that we showed prevents edema due to IRI, can ameliorate lung IRI. X-In8 is a biotechnology company whose mission is to develop strategies to temporarily turn off innate immunity to prevent IRI. Demonstrating effectiveness of CRX-526 to reduce IRI in relevant translational cell culture models of IRI and LTX models will justify Phase II studies using survival LTX models to evaluate commercial applications in the LTX market, followed by studies in other types of organ transplant and other clinical scenarios of IRI such as CPB, MI, and stroke.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), which occurs when blood flow stops and then starts again, causes damage to tissue or organs in heart attacks, strokes, heart bypass surgery, and organ transplantation. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) of the innate immune system, in particular TLR4, contribute to edema and inflammation in IRI. In Phase I, we will determine the benefit of inhibiting TLR4 activation with CRX-526, an agent that we showed prevents edema due to IRI; in Phase II we plan to determine efficacy of CRX-526 in lung transplantation. This work may expand the supply of healthy lungs for transplant and could stop IRI in heart attack, stroke or heart bypass."

This allows the use of sensitive detectionthresholds, and, in an actual fault condition, may allow an aircraft to maintain enough control to complete a mission or to safely land.Phase 1 research will examine various arc quenching algorithms in a laboratory testbed.  Arcing severity will be characterized through infrared sensors and power will be removed and then restored with varying schedules to examine the conditions underwhich an arc may be tolerably controlled through solid state switching.  The proposed technology represents an augmentation that will be compatible with existing arc fault detection/interruption technologies.  While applicable to both DC and ACelectrical systems, it will have its greatest impact on DC arc fault control where only the severest of faults are presently detectable. By allowing a higher sensitivity fault detection threshold to be used, the proposed research enhances sensitivity forarc fault interrupter circuits, increasing the safety they can provide to both commercial and military aircraft.  Since aircraft are routinely maintained in service beyond their intended design life, this represents an important addition to thestate-of-the-art and a mature technology should enjoy wide acceptance in both markets.  In the commercial nonaviation market, arc fault interrupters are presently mandated in new construction in the U.S. (market potential of over 4 million units peryear), have been mandated for air conditioners beginning in 2004 (5.7 million units per year) and will see expanded use in the electric and hybrid electric vehicle markets."

As a result, fluoroscopic radiation levels are higher for the average patient than they would be with a more efficient grid system, and higher still for large patients. Poor image quality often increases the beam-on time required to successfully perform interventional procedures, increasing the radiation dose still further. This problem is critical in interventional exams, where skin doses are occasionally high enough to induce radiation burns1-3, and effective doses often exceed those of CT exams4 and contribute about 14% of the nationwide effective dose from medical imaging procedures5. Our proposal is to develop a high efficiency antiscatter grid system that will result in a significant improvement in fluoroscopy system dose efficiency. The results of our benchmarked Monte Carlo modeling indicate that a factor of 1.5 to 2.0 or more improvement is achievable.Cardiologists and radiologists can use this improvement either to produce higher quality images at current fluoroscopic radiation levels, allowing them to shorten exams, or to produce images comparable to today's image quality standards at markedly lower dose rates. The proposed innovative antiscatter grid system will incorporate a coarse strip density, air interspaced grid and a reciprocating grid drive with innovative approaches to suppress vibrations and grid artifacts. In Phase I we will build a grid and drive system and demonstrate: 1) the use of the system in fluorographic (digital spot) imaging; 2) the robust suppression of grid artifacts; and 3) a dose efficiency at least 1.5 times greater than that of commonly used grids. In Phase II we will build avibration-free reciprocating drive system suitable for fluoroscopic imaging, a compact x-ray tube grid bias supply to perform fast x-ray switching for short x-ray pulses, and with our manufacturing partner we will modify a commercially available clinicalfluoroscopy unit to demonstrate the use and performance of the grid system. Of practical importance is that the domestic manufacturer has already expressed interest in evaluating the grid system for inclusion in their product line and in commercializing the technology.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Millions of fluoroscopic examinations are performed each year, and these exams often result in high patient radiation doses and injury1-3, are among the highest dose exams in medical imaging4, and account for 14% of the effective dose from medical imaging in the United States5. We propose to improve the dose efficiency of fluoroscopy by a factor of 1.5 to 2.0 or more. This significant improvement will be accomplished by building an innovative high efficiency antiscatter grid system; clinical fluoroscopic systems using this grid system will be able to achieve markedly improved image quality at current radiation dose levels, or alternatively will be able to achieve image quality comparable to that obtained on today's fluoroscopic systems at a fraction of the radiation dose."

In recent years this problem has been aggravated by the use of less efficient (thin, high line density, low lead content) grids, and the increasing size of patients. As a result, radiographic image quality is often insufficient to answer questions concerning trauma and other clinical areas, and patients undergo additional higher dose, more expensive imaging exams. In many instances these additional exams could be eliminated and health care costs reduced if a better radiographic imaging system were available. We propose a coarse, high-ratio air interspace grid coupled to an orthogonally aligned low-ratio conventional grid. Together, these will effectively eliminate scatter and will have a primary transmission comparable to commonly used grids. A low-ratio grid is compatible with a range of source-to-image distances (SIDs). The coarse grid will have articulating grid slats, permitting variable SIDs and angled views. In order to build a compact and clinically acceptable system, the coarse grid can only move a short distance to blur out grid lines. It has been demonstrated that this can be accomplished by employing a quasi-trapezoidal x-ray tube current waveform. In Phase I we propose to demonstrate that an appropriate quasi-trapezoidal x-ray tube current waveform can be obtained in general radiography. In Phase II we propose to design and construct a compact and high efficiency crossed-grid system, interface it to an x-ray generator, and demonstrate that it can control scatter much more effectively than a conventional grid. The system will be able to accommodate general radiography, chest radiography, angled projections, tomography, and a range of SIDs. It can be used with either screen-film or digital image receptors, and will improve tomosynthesis and dual energy applications.

The intervention at the manufacturing or distribution center will substantially eliminate the exposure to the consumer at home, school, work, or from the product that ends up in a landfill. This electronics manufacturing analyzer will be fit for purpose on the factory floor, enabled by new, powerful, proprietary, monochromatic doubly curved crystal (DCC) X-ray optics, source configurations, and associated software that greatly increases the efficiency and sensitivity for this elemental analysis. These toxins occur naturally in the environment, but also are included in manufacturing processes for purposes such as UV resistance, durability, and strength. Abnormal levels of these toxic elements in the body areknown to be associated with many health disorders such as cancer, cognitive impairment, as well as respiratory, cardiological, and other neurological symptoms. In spite of their recognized importance, only recently have these toxic metals been regulated atlevels exceeding current practical measurement techniques (i.e. Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive of 2002, and Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008). Current field-portable instrumentation does not meet the quantitative needs of manufacturers or regulatory agencies. This has caused a significant shift to laboratory-based measurements which are accurate, but they are also complex, time-consuming, and expensive. That approach requires sample transportation, handling, delays, and highlytrained operators. The laboratories certified for such measurements are also limited in number and regional in distribution. As a result, neither solution is fit for purpose. The toxic element analyzer proposed in this project is based on advancing the X-ray optics and software capability for use in electronics and toys, while simultaneously making it simple-to-use for any operator with minimal training. The new system will allow unprecedented X-ray fluorescence of sensitivity for simultaneously measuringmost regulated elemental toxins, including traditionally difficult to measure elements such as cadmium, antimony, and barium. The proposed new analyzer changes the public-health situation dramatically by offering an inexpensive, reliable elemental toxin analyzer that is fit for purpose on the factory floor. By intervening at the source, this instrument will reduce or eliminate the risk of unknowing direct exposure from our consumer products as well as indirect exposure in the environment from disposal of these items in a landfill. This will reduce health-care costs, and simultaneously improve regulatory compliance capabilities.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed electronics and manufacturing analyzer has the potential to substantially mitigate or even eliminate many toxic element exposures by intervening at the source with a quantitative, simple-to-use, substantially matrix independent, and nondestructive instrument to identify problems at the factory or distribution center before the toxins reach the home, school, or work place. The positive impacts to public health include decreased toxic element exposure, which leads to reduced public-health effects, reduced remediation costs, and reduced health-care costs. The applicability for such an instrumentis vast and includes testing for the regulated toxic elements (i.e. Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive of 2002, or Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008) in electronics, other related consumer products, and products intended for children."

The techniques start in a lab, are continued in a pilot campaign, and finally graduate to full-scale manufacturing. To improve drug quality and manufacturing, in 2001, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated Quality by Design (QbD) and Process Analytical Technology (PAT) Guidance for the pharmaceutical industry. This project will provide the ability to comply with that guidance and continuously monitor pharmaceutical quality during manufacturing. Crystallization of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) involves achieving a specific crystalline phase, for which there can also be multiple polymorphic forms, a critical factor for drug effectiveness. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) is the 'gold standard' analytical tool to determine API crystalline phase composition and polymorphic form. Unfortunately, PXRD is not currently used online real-timebecause of the configuration requirements for conventional PXRD. It is currently applied offline in the laboratory because of constraining sample presentation requirements and the system size, complexity, and operator-skill requirements of conventional PXRD systems. Recent developments at X-Ray Optical Systems (XOS) of collimating optics and detector systems provide an opportunity to overcome these problems and enable a wide range of online PXRD applications. The objective of the proposed project is development of a reliable, easy-to-use, compact, and safe PXRD system for continuous monitoring of crystalline characteristics of API real-time during drug development and manufacture. This will improve process control and, therefore, assurance of product quality by directly measuring the pharmaceutical critical quality attributes rather than reliance on monitoring process conditions supported by relatively infrequent sampling. The project focuses on online measurements during the API crystallization phase. Thiswill be done with pharmaceutical industry collaborators at Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS). Feasibility for such measurements has been demonstrated on the benchtop during Phase I studies. It will be demonstrated online at a BMS pharmaceutical research and manufacturing facility in Phase II. Phase II will include all of the necessary instrument development steps required to design, assemble, and test the prototype. This includes sample presentation, the fixed detector approach, and integrating the analyzer with an existing reactor at BMS. XOS has extensive experience with online optic-enabled XRD and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) applications. The proposed project is a match with the NIH Research Objectives for the Manufacturing Processes of Medical, Dental, and Biological Technologies topic as a systems-level technology. Improved drug quality, improved public health, reduced manufacturing costs, and reduced health-care costs are the ultimate goals.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed analyzer will increase control over the quality of pharmaceuticals by providing the ability to measure the actual drug crystalline/molecular form during the process for the first time, compared to current practice of just monitoring the manufacturing parameters. The analyzer willbe compact, inexpensive, and able to be set up and operated by operators and technicians. The ability to measure crystallinity in the drug directly online during development, pilot scale up, and full-scale manufacturing will impact public health by improving the consistency of pharmaceutical quality, reducing time to market by faster manufacturing ramp up, reducing manufacturing costs by increased process control, and improving manufacturing compliance through application of the FDA's Process Analytical Technology (PAT) drug certification guidelines."

As a result, it is difficult to discern whether nuclear material is safeguarded correctly, i.e. is it being diverted? The opportunity addressed is a substantial improvement in measurement sensitivity for global safeguards of nuclear material, which directly addresses a primary objective of the DOE global safeguards program. Several approaches for measuring Pu and Cm are used in processing and reprocessing plants today, including gamma ray and neutron counting. There is no elemental discrimination possible with neutron measurements and the gamma-ray background from the fission-product materials masks accurate determination of the Cm content. XOS proposes to develop an ultra high-energy optic-enabled x-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique that is fit-for-purpose in improving measurement scrutiny at quantification by greater than 10X. The team will demonstrate the feasibility of the XRF optics in Phase I, and assemble a prototype in Phase II that will be used for direct measurement of nuclear materials, and as a complimentary method for existing measurement techniques. The Phase I optics development requires a technology development in three areas where XOS is uniquely qualified: optics materials, optics cutting and polishing, and optics bending and forming.

The electrodes in the fuel cell, either the single-element GDE, or an anode and cathode in a complete a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), is the critical electrochemical component for every proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. The catalyst coating of GDE is one of the more expensive manufacturing processes in the MEA production. However, the process is lacking an online technology for catalyst thickness and distribution measurements. As a result, the impact of manufacturing changes as they relate to both production and performance is not fully understood. The unique, optic-based XRF analyzer proposed in the current project will allow real-time measurement of the catalyst-coating thickness and elemental distribution. It will provide timely feedback for the GDE production process where changes or improvements can be accommodated immediately. This would improve yield and the overall performance of the GDE products. The objective of the project is to demonstrate the feasibility, while the ultimate goal is to build an instrument that will be used on a GDE production line.
The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the technique developed would benefit both the manufacturing process as well as the overall performance of the fuel cell system. Fuel cell stack efficiency can drop significantly after a few thousand hours of use, which is part of the reason the fuel cell system is not widely used for stationary distributed energy generation. Thus, there is an immediate need to reduce the degradation rate and extend the stack operating life. The measurement of catalyst coating thickness and distribution in production can be a critical link to understand the performance impacts of subtle production changes. Currently there is no practical online, real-time, continuous, nondestructive method to provide this information. The X-ray analyzer incorporates the latest X-ray optics and makes it possible to achieve the anticipated performance with a low power and compact system. The dual benefit of using manufacturing process control to decrease cost and improve final product performance is attractive, enabling a more competitive industry in the U.S. that is more efficient and has a smaller environmental footprint than before. Further, the measurement techniques developed for the fuel cell process can readily be applied to other similar rolling or coating manufacturing processes."

Restrictions such as the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) are expanding world wide beyond lead to include additional harmful elements at trace levels. The analyzer will provide manufacturers the means to conveniently test their products, raw materials, and components for compliance with the new standards. Currently, there is no practical method to accurately test outside of a lab. The objective is to construct an analyzer for quantifying ten toxic elements at or below regulated levels. The analyzer will use XOS's world-leading x-ray optics to produce multiple monochromatic beams from a single x-ray tube, providing excellent sensitivity, lower limits of detection, and short measurement times for the entire relevant part of the periodic table. It will include advanced software for processing the combined data sets and separating the results for the coatings and substrates. The low-power consumption, reduced maintenance, and compact design are fit for purpose in manufacturing, distribution, or regulatory environments.
The broader impact of this research is the mitigation of inadvertent exposure risk. Toys and other consumer products will be safer as adults and children are protected from toxic elements. American manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and regulators are facing increasing global regulations restricting hazardous substances in manufactured products with associated costs and liability risks. This new testing capability would reduce testing costs by more than 75%, currently more than $1B, compared to existing laboratory-based methods. It would also assist U.S. manufacturers and distributors in cost-effective compliance by testing before the products leave the plant or distribution center, thereby, gaining or preserving their competitive position and avoiding the loss of sales and jobs due to offshore migration of manufacturing. This analyzer will also enable manufactures to safely explore new materials as a substitute for restricted materials. Consumer fears provide U.S. manufacturers an opportunity to increase market share if they can demonstrate safety. Additionally, the societal benefits for consumers are significant. Consumers can be certain the products they buy are safe. The ability to accurately detect toxic elements will help to reduce their proliferation into the marketplace and improve public health. This enables improved quality of life and a reduced health care burden."

There are ten elements regulated for their toxic effects world- wide. The challenge is that these ten elements are difficult or impossible to measure simultaneously at the regulated levels with traditional XRF or any other chemical or combustion technique. It is both difficult and expensive to limit the exposure risk to these toxins for medical, regulatory, and manufacturing teams. Two of the most difficult elements for XRF are cadmium (Cd) and antimony (Sb). In the proposed project, XOS will develop X-ray optics that can be integrated into commercial XRF systems. XOS already provides other x-ray optics for other medical, compliance, and research instruments. The team includes the world leaders in developing optics for and integrating optics into analytical systems. XOS will develop X-ray optics for Cd and Sb measurements that meet or exceed the regulated levels. The proposed optics is based on extending the capabilities of our successful, commercially available monochromatic optics and doubly-curved crystal (DCC) optics to higher energy ranges than are currently possible. Thus, they will retain the high-sensitivity and low-background advantages of the current DCC optics. The optics will be designed, developed, tested, and validated in the proposed project. The proposed new optics for Cd and Sb will be incredibly valuable to epidemiological studies, occupational exposure monitoring, and medical treatment teams, as well as manufacturers by using the optics in an XRF instrument which is accurate, reliable, nondestructive, simple-to-use, inexpensive, and compact. Such an optic-enabled instrument would have a positive impact on public health by rapidly identifying the source and level of risks, screening for toxicity, assessing levels in patients with related diseases (e.g., pulmonary or kidney disease), monitoring patients undergoing chelation therapy, conducting a heavy metal screen for people with an occupational exposure risk, and helping manufacturers and farmers eliminate these toxins. Further, the in-vitro detection of these trace metals could be compared to existing data sets in wider exposure studies such as the Genes, Environment and Health Initiative (GEI). This significantly increases the usefulness and marketability of the instrument. Because of the broad commercial applications, this will enable the production of lower-cost instruments for medical, environmental, and occupational exposure applications. Society will benefit from improved knowledge of the role of these metals which are linked to many respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematological, and musculoskeletal diseases (DHHS 1992, 1999). Use in bone, renal, heart, liver, etc. studies of other medical pathologies and in other fields such as forensic, atmospheric, geological, agricultural, chemical, pharmaceutical etc. will, over time, greatly broaden the medical, scientific, industrial, and, therefore, societal benefits.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will develop the X-ray optics for cadmium and antimony to enable X-ray fluorescence to simultaneously measure the entire range of toxic elements normally monitored for occupational exposure, medical treatment, consumer products, and industrial uses with an instrument which is accurate, reliable, nondestructive, simple-to-use, inexpensive, and compact. Such an optic-enabled instrument would have a positive impact on public health by rapidly identifying the source and level of risks, screening for toxicity, assessing levels in patients with related diseases (e.g., pulmonary or renal disease, and reproductive or developmental effects), monitoring patients undergoing chelation therapy, conducting a heavy metal screen for people with an occupational exposure risk, and helping manufacturers and farmers eliminate these toxins from their products. Further, the in-vitro detection of these trace metals could be compared to existing data sets in wider exposure studies such as the Genes, Environment and Health Initiative (GEI), which significantly increases the usefulness and marketability of the instrument and, therefore, will enable the production of lower- cost instruments for medical, environmental, and occupational exposure applications."

Recent statistics from the engine overhaul depots indicate that greater than 50 percent of the bearings are rejected. Approximately 40 percent of these rejections are due to corrosion. For naval applications, the rejection rate is even higher. Such corrosion leads to premature surface crack initiation and spalling that cascades into accelerated surface damage, high vibration, and eventual catastrophic bearing failure. It is the goal of this project to develop a highly sensitive, compact, light-weight, low-power, reliable, safe, easy to use, inexpensive to own and maintain, x-ray fluorescence analyzer for direct, trace measurement of trace contaminants in gearbox lubricants. The proposed compact, direct, trace element analyzer is based on a number of developments at X-ray Optical Systems (XOS) over a several year period. This includes unique doubly curved crystal (DCC) monochromating and focusing x-ray optics and compact, highly reliable X-Beam x-ray sources. The gearbox lubricant analyzer can be used on the tarmac or flight deck during routine or preflight inspections or potentially can be mounted on aircraft for continuous on-line lubricant monitoring. This new technology has many important potential military and civilian applications.BENEFITS: Given the proposed operating regime of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), there are clearly environments containing corrosion elements like salt water/vapor. The proposed gear box lubrication monitoring product can be designed for use in routine inspections, periodic inspections or even in flight. A successful cost-effective, low power, compact, non-destructive tool for verifying proper gearbox operation would decrease propulsion failure and aircraft mishaps. An additional benefit can be realized if the gear box monitoring system decreased the frequency of inspections because the proposed system was used to improve the process. The initial users of the analyzer would be the aircraft and propulsion manufacturers who supply the engine, lift system and gearbox hardware to the Department of Defense for the F-35 such as Rolls Royce in Indianapolis, Indiana. In some cases, the outside firms that provide evaluation services would also utilize this instrument. Follow on uses of the monitoring technology would be other advanced propulsion and ground based power generation applications where performance, reliability and robustness are important."

Even small, short-term increases in the amount of air particulte contamination in the atmosphere can produce significant increases in both mortality and morbidity from respiratory and cardiovasulare diseases. For example, recent studies show that just two hours of breathing fine particles in a city from sources such as vehicle exhaust and smokestacks can increase the risk of heart attach by 44%. An example of an indirect health rick comes from the highly toxic elementary mercury. It enters the environment principally from burning of coal; gets dispersed by air partifculates; contaminates soil, plants, and bodies of water; concentrates in the good chain and is finally ingested by humans. Because of the importance of air particulates more then 5000 air-particulate monitoring stations have been established in the United States (wilt perhaps four times as many internationally). Most measure the toatal amount (Mass) of air particulte per volume of air, and more recently, the size distribution of particuate matter.

Currently, because of the complexity and expense involved in measuring important trace elements at the parts-per-billion level required, samples must be collected and sent to regional laboratories. Routine, high-sensitivity, point-of-care, measurement of trace elements can be valuable in three distinct ways: 1) Detection and measurement of nonessential toxic metals, such as lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic; 2) Monitoring the concentration of essential elements such as copper, zinc, selenium, chromium and iron, usually in plasma but also in urine and blood, to detect deficiency (related to growth retardation, Menke's disease, cardiovascular disease, etc.), or excess (related to diabetes, cancer, obesity, stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, etc.); and 3) Measurement of the efficiency and rate of removal of toxic or excess elements by chelation therapy.

This is especially true for the so-called redox metals (Iron, Copper, Manganese, and Zinc) which are required for development and operation of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system but also play a central role in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Friedreich's ataxia, and others. In addition, neurotoxic metals such as Lead, Mercury, Arsenic, and Cadmium have been shown to impair neural function even at trace levels. Current methods to monitor the concentration, distribution, and function of metals have specialized benefits but none allow quantitative measurement of the concentration and distribution of the broad range of metals and concentrations of interest. New and efficient x-ray optics now enable monochromatic micro x-ray fluorescence (MMXRF) tools for measurement of virtually all metals in tissue samples with high sensitivity, dynamic range and spatial resolution. Furthermore, this can be achieved with a safe, compact, reliable, low power, cost effective, easy-to- use analyzer that can operate in medical research laboratories directly on tissue samples before they are dried, stained or treated for other complementary studies. The aim of this project is to develop and apply such a point-of-use analyzer.

The satellite position can be determined by an onboard GPS receiver that continuously tracks all-in-view GPS satellites. The objective of this effort is to complete the design of the GPS antenna system and evaluate how well it will meet the Air Force requirements. A low profile GPS microstrip antenna element was designed for this proposal, producing circular polarization at both GPS frequencies L1 and L2. Microstrip patch GPS antennas are often used on missiles, the proposed element is adapted from that demonstrated design. Preliminary impedance match and pattern data was computed for the element which shows good impedance match and element patterns at L1 and L2. The element would be placed at several locations on the satellite. Antenna architectures, element location, and beam control are discussed, with advantages of several architectures compared. This effort will be performed by a Principal Investigator with extensive antenna design experience including patch antennas on missiles, GPS antennas, satellite tracking and communications antennas, and computer-aided design of antennas."

Widespread use of polycapillary optics is currently impeded because after the design stage, the first working prototype may take a month or more of manufacturing effort. Consequently, both the need and the opportunity exists to develop a comprehensive approach to lens production by computer aided design/computer aided manufacture (CAD/CAM). In this Phase I proposal, we will demonstrate the feasibility of controlling the polycapillary lens manufacturing process from design to product by testing and evaluating the critical parameters and developing an approach for real-time computer process control. The work is expected to lead to a process that will condense the production cycle time to one hour. Our expert team of scientists, progrannners and engineers have the key skill set to develop this innovation in automated manufacture of polycapillary optics. Furthermore, as the design-to-product time decreases, the responsiveness and cost effectiveness for single optic and batch production runs for research, medical, military, and industrial applications would dramatically improve. The radically shortened production schedule for advanced technology, polycapillary x-ray optics will directly effect US competitiveness through the sale of optics, and more importantly, the sale of competitively superior x-ray based instruments."

The ghost-point communication involves non-contiguous memory access and hence hardware or software-based packing and unpacking of vector entries. For scalability, the global reductions must be non-blocking to allow the use of pipelined Krylov methods. The major challenge to utilize GPU systems in an MPI environment for algebraic solvers is simultaneously using all available hardware resources, specifically instruction scheduling (i.e., kernel launches), computation, and communication. Achieving this requires MPI support for streams (to overlap MPI kernel launches with communication and computation), efficient non-contiguous memory access nearest neighbor collectives, and GPU efficient non-blocking global reductions. This project will be led by X-ScaleSolutions, in collaboration with Dr. Todd Munson (Argonne National Laboratory and the leader of the PETSc team), Dr. Victor Eijkhout (Texas Advanced Computing Center and a member of the PETSc team) and Dr. Sameer Shende and Dr. Allen Malony (ParaTools, Inc. and the leaders of the TAU team). To address the severe challenge described above, X-ScaleSolutions proposes to design and develop âSMART- PETScâ a Smart Middleware for Accelerating PETSc on modern high-performance computing hardware. We will work along the following directions: 1) developing optimized datatype processing techniques for intra-/inter-node transfers using kernel-fusion novel and advanced capabilities of emerging hardware, 2) designing optimized methods to overlap kernel launch and kernel execution time to enable simultaneous use of all available hardware resources, 3) co-designing PETSc and MVAPICH using the MPI T interface to support user specified GPU streams, 4) supporting in-network collective communication for high-performance and high-overlap non-blocking CPU-/GPU-based collectives, 5) supporting in- network collective communication for high-performance neighborhood collectives, 6) enabling full stack observability and explainability through tight integration with the TAU Performance System using the MPI T interface, 7) measuring the impact of the proposed designs on PETSc end applications, and 8) conducting systematic test and evaluation to ensure proper integration. Tasks 1, 2, parts of 3 and 6, relevant portion of 8 will be carried out as part of Phase-1 activities. The transformative impact of the proposed SMART- PETSc product will be to enable many HPC and DL frameworks/applications that use PETSc APIs to take advantage of the novel features and capabilities on emerging hardware technologies and reap the additive benefits of co-design and tighter integration between PETSc and MVAPICH libraries. We expect that the solutions SMART-PETSc will provide can reduce the communication overhead by up to 5x. This can lead to a significant boost in performance and scalability of many HPC and DL frame- works/applications that use PETSc APIs. The proposed collaboration will not only enable DOE Labs to use the SMART-PETSc middleware on upcoming exascale systems, but also provide a commercial version of this middleware for use by supercomputing centers and cloud providers worldwide."

For example, I/O-intensive HPC, Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) applications are hitting the I/O wall on large-scale systems. These applications are also spending a lot of time in checkpoint-restart phases. The Scalable Checkpoint-Restart (SCR) project, designed and developed by researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), has made considerable progress along these lines. This code has been deployed on many LLNL systems and has demonstrated benefits to many users. The current version of the SCR library needs enhancements and hardening to achieve cross-platform portability and applicability for a diverse range of supercomputers and HPC clouds. The core support within the current SCR library also needs multiple enhancements to satisfy the needs of next generation Exascale systems and applications. The proposed project takes a systematic and comprehensive approach to enhance SCR for next-generation HPC, DL and ML applications using a set of new features, enhancements and capabilities. The project will be led by X-ScaleSolutions, in collaboration with research partners Dr. Kathryn Mohror and Adam Moody (the original developers and maintainers of the SCR library) of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The project will develop a set of innovations in SCR-Exa to take advantage of the various features and mechanisms of the next generation networking, computing, and storage technologies. These innovations include: 1) modular design with plug and play support for a diverse set of resource managers and job launchers, 2) enhanced user interface with Python support, 3) Python bindings for HPC/DL/ML applications and frameworks, 4) optimized designs with asynchronous data transfers, 5) offloading redundancy encoding schemes using multi-threading, 6) I/O acceleration through integration with UnifyFS, 7) designs for checkpoint-restart on sub-communicators, 8) applicability of the SCR library to cloud environments with virtualization support, and 9) integrated development and evaluation.

This is primarily due to the lack of a holistic performance monitoring and analysis tool for the emerging DL area. The proposed DeepIntrospect DI) product will build upon existing and recognized capabilities to enhance state-of- the-art capabilities to holistically monitor, analyze, and understand the performance of DL applications and frameworks on next-generation HPC systems. X-ScaleSolutions proposes to create Deep- Introspect DI), a highly efficient and easy to use tool for performance engineering of extreme-scale deep learning applications. To realize our vision for the DI tool we propose the following key develop- ment goals: 1) Develop a Performance Monitoring framework for CPU, GPU, interconnects intra-node and inter-node), and file systems; 2) Design an integrated profiler to capture low-level communication statistics as well as offer high-level insights into application layerâs performance; 3) Develop a unified log parser with basic and advanced modules to combine various sources of performance data; 4) Design a responsive GUI that can act as a one-stop dashboard for all DI users; 5) Develop a high-performance DataStore including support for text-based logs as well as a structured database for efficient access; 6) Design the connectors API for internal usage as well as for interoperatability with external tools; and 7) Develop a plugin architecture for GUI and implement one plugin as an example for external developers. As part of Phase-I activities, we will work on parts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 and demonstrate the significance and benefits of the DI tool for a representative set of DL applications. There is a sizable market for Deep Learning of $3.18 Billion/year in 2018, which is expected to grow to $18.16 billion by the end of 2023 according to MarketsandMarkets research. DeepIntrospect has the potential to fundamentally simplify the vast majority of tasks that are being performed by several researchers and scientists across the world. Deep Learning being a relatively new area with ever-changing software libraries and domain-specific hardware presents a unique challenge. Beginners entering the field can end up wasting not only several man-hours but tons of GPU/CPU cycles in training DNNs. DeepIntrospect will allow the beginner scientists and researchers to better align their efforts if they can easily introspect and analyze the behaviour of their model in a simplified fashion. For advanced users and program/product managers, it is more about offloading the cumbersome parts of performance monitoring and analysis to developers and scientists. DeepIntrospect will greatly increase developer/scientists productivity thereby helping the senior/middle management to focus more on design and marketing of DL products and less on low-level details."

Such a technology has the potential to greatly improve the biobanking and transport infrastructure of healthcare for on-demand cells and tissues, improved mass trauma care and advanced personalized medical procedures. Biopreservation is required in regenerative medicine at nearly all levels in the acquisition of source material, isolation, storage and shipment of a final product to patient. Yet critically, the field lacks the ability to safely and efficiently preserve these tissues and medicines while maintaining high cell viability and function after cryopreservation, severely limiting product shelf life. Nowhere is the absence of a biobanking technology more palpable than organ transplantation, where the time window between donor and recipient (4-7 hours) is not enough to properly match donations, screen for pathogens, or transport long distances. Enabling the United States to safely bank organs at subzero temperature will significantly enhance national healthcare. The US faces strong commercial and competitiveness reasons to invest in all facets of regenerative medicine, including organ therapies. Cryopreservation solutions would indirectly enable significant savings to the healthcare system, the patient, and healthcare insurance companies with the cost savings from regenerative medicine treatments estimated to be nearly $250 billion per year in the U.S. The cytotoxicity of current biopreservation techniques is largely associated with inefficient cryoprotective agent and water delivery across the cell membrane during cooling leading to irreparable cell damage from ice formation. Phase I established a fundamentally different approach to cryoprotective agent (CPA) optimization by developing first-in-the-field bioinspired nanopores as transmembrane mega highways to facilitate safe and efficient intracellular delivery and removal of cryoprotective agents during cryopreservation and dramatically increase post-thaw cell yield, viability, and function. The pore-formers assist CPA loading at reduced temperatures to make up the functional loss of biological protein channels at cold temperatures, reduce the amount of CPA required to remarkably low concentrations, and expand the selectable range of CPAs, all while dynamically dissociating at physiological temperature to prevent open-pore toxicity. Further R&D effort will diversify molecular design, optimize lead molecules, scale-up production, and perform cryopreservation studies on regenerative medicines of major therapeutic significance such as stem cells and complex tissues. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The use of cryoprotective agents (CPAs) like DMSO is hindered by their innate cytotoxicity and unfavorable effects in patients infused with DMSO containing HSCs. Opportunity lies in the development of a highly effective CPA or media system that significantly reduces or removes the use of harmful CPAs from cryoprotectant solutions. A cutting-edge preservation method and protocol is needed.Biomedical applications of hydrogels are ever growing with the advancement of antibiotic and traumatic wound care, time and location specific drug delivery, tissue engineering scaffolds, cell preservation, etc.X-Therma has engineered an advanced biomimetic cryoprotective matrix system for eventual use in bone marrow preservation. Phase I will focus on feasibility studies to assess the inherent cryoprotective effect of the matrix system. CD34+ cells will be encapsulated, subjected to a cryopreservation protocol and rewarming procedure. Simple cell assessment by live/dead and metabolic activity assays will be used to show feasibility."

Such a technology has the potential to changing regenerative healthcare forever. It would change biobanking for on-demand cells and tissues and improve mass trauma care and advanced personalized medical procedures. Biopreservation is required in regenerative medicine at nearly all levels in the acquisition of source material, isolation, storage and shipment of a final product to patient. Yet, critically, the field lacks the ability to safely and efficiently preserve these tissues and medicines severely limiting product shelf life. Nowhere is the absence of a biobanking technology more palpable than organ transplantation, where the time window between donor and recipient (4-7 hours) is not enough to properly match donations, screen for pathogens, or transport distances. More people will die from premature organ failure than cancer. Enabling the United States to safely bank organs at subzero temperature will significantly enhance national healthcare. The US faces strong commercial and competitiveness reasons to invest in all facets of regenerative medicine, including organ therapies. Cryopreservation solutions would indirectly enable significant savings to the healthcare system, the patient, and healthcare insurance companies with the cost savings from regenerative medicine treatments estimated to be nearly $250 billion per year in the U.S. The cytotoxicity of current biopreservation techniques is largely associated with inefficient cryoprotective agent and water delivery across the cell membrane during cooling leading to irreparable cell damage from ice formation. The goal of this project is to establish a fundamentally different approach to cryoprotective agent optimization by developing first-in-the-field bioinspired nanopores as transmembrane mega highways to facilitate safe and efficient intracellular delivery and removal of cryoprotective agents during cryopreservation. Past research has demonstrated the reliability of constructing well-defined nanotubular assemblies via the enforced stacking of shape-persistent macrocycles based on the interplay of multiple hydrogen-bonding, dipole-dipole, and aromatic pi-pi stacking interactions and their self-insertion into lipid bilayers. These rationally designed organic nanopores will serve as selective transmembrane channels when protein channels malfunction at or below 3 Â°C. As a result, the cell's exposure time to reach ice-free cryopreservation temperature will be significantly reduced. Post-preservation cell yield and viability will be greatly improved by reducing intracellular ice formation. Upon rewarming, these organic nanopores will facilitate rapid removal of the cryoprotective agents. At physiological temperature, the nanopores will seal off, and be washed out from the system resulting in low toxicity. Nanopore function and effect will be examined using liposome-based glucose transport, cell-based toxicity and cell-based cryopreservation assays."

This lack of a hyper-effective and safe alternative leads to wide spread use of toxic cryoprotectants.Preventing ice remains a physical and chemical problem and innovative cryoprotectants can be realized using new chemistries. In Phase I, we developed a fundamentally different approach to cryoprotectant discovery and our first low-toxicity biomimetic antifreeze that is chemically stable at a variety of temperatures (-196C to 250C), hundreds of times more effective, and far less toxic at effective concentration.In Phase II, we will examine these properties in greater detail while developing our commercial storage solutions to protect cells and tissues.

Some of these changes include electrode expansion, electrode ruffling, dendrite formation, internal gas formation, and internal density changes. A key characteristic of these changes is that most of them occur prior to any external measurable parameter variation, such as in terminal voltage, surface temperature, or mechanical surface strain. Therefore, detecting internal cell structural and mechanical changes early and with adequate resolution has several benefits, including the prevention of catastrophic accidents sufficiently ahead of time, and the gathering of additional information that can be used to more accurately assess the health and life of cells during operation.

However, a primary challenge in this immature process is the lack of knowledge and controlling of the microstructure formation and evolution through this method, especially for the in-process interface between layers where defects are likely to be generated. Although after-process destructive inspection may provide information about the grainrsquo;s microstructure for the additively manufactured part, the after-process characterization does not reveal critical in situ information and thus the possibility for in situ correction. Therefore, any means to measure surface and buried defects in situ efficiently with a high spatial resolution would be highly desirable. To address this critical need, X-wave Innovations, Inc. (XII) proposes to develop an innovative optical-thermal-thermosonic-infrared (OTTI) imaging technology for the nondestructive, in-process inspection of critical flaws both on the layer surface and inside the welded build. The proposed NDE technique builds on the XII-developed multi-frequency thermosonic infrared technology, which is capable of detection of defects as small as micron-size. Combined with the optical and thermal imaging techniques, OTTI reveals unprecedented information in situ on defect formation between layers and microstructure evolution on the layers, which can lead to further in situ correction and control for the structure and quality of the building part during the additive manufacturing process.nbsp;"

While popular, such techniques pose operational safety risks as well as security risks due to the use of radioisotopic materials. Therefore, the DOE has a goal of reducing dependence on commercial and industrial radioactive materials for nuclear nonproliferation. The DOE and the Office of Proliferation Detection is therefore interested in advanced technology solutions to replace inspection techniques that use radiological sources. The developed technology must adopt non-radioisotopic alternative techniques to perform inspections in a reliable, cost-effective and safe manner. To address this critical need, X-wave Innovations, Inc., teaming up with TechOpp Consulting, Inc., proposes an advanced full matrix capture ultrasonic imaging and inspection suite using ultrasonic phased array (UPA) technology, accompanied by software tools to analyze and interpret acquired ultrasonic imaging data. The key innovations in this proposal include the use of an array of ultrasonic sensors to perform inspections, in the implementation of advanced inspection techniques to enable detection of all manner of material defects, and in the development of analysis and interpretation algorithms to create an uncomplicated inspection suite that is easy to operate and get results from. UPA systems combine several ultrasonic transducers in a single probe, and each constituent transducer can be setup to act as ultrasonic transmitter and receiver independently or in synchrony with other transducers to query a three-dimensional material region. The UPA will be used for full matrix capture (FMC), where each transducer is activated in sequence while every transducer acts as receiver. Through this arrangement, multiple sets of responses are acquired by each sensor corresponding to the slightly different paths traveled by the sound waves. The acquired responses will be time shifted, weighted and combined using the Total Focusing Method (TFM) to artificially âfocusâ the ultrasonic waves successively at each point within the material, and use the resultant response to estimate the presence and extent of flaws at each point. During the Phase I program, we will build a prototype sensor hardware and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. We will implement the full matrix capture data acquisition technique for inspecting test specimens. We will develop algorithms to analyze and combine the numerous ultrasonic signals acquired in different configurations. This process is meant to superpose the ultrasonic signals to simulate their focusing in different parts of the test specimen, thus allowing accurate inspection of all regions. We will also develop tools to present analysis results.The proposed project has a clear path to transition into commercial applications. The proposed technology replaces radiographic methods and is inherently safe and secure, thus reducing additional operational expenses associated with additional security and safety precautions associated with radio-isotopic techniques. The proposed technology is capable of detecting various different flaws, is reliable and robust in all environs, and easy to setup and operate. The combination of these qualities presents an attractive proposition to prospective customers. We therefore envision that the proposed full matrix capture ultrasonic imaging based inspection system will be widely applicable in different scenarios. XII is in a unique position to promote and introduce this new technology, thanks to our established partnerships with prime contractors and market leaders in the defense community and the commercial sector. XII will initiate commercialization efforts by working closely with our partners, and we will leverage our connections and actively engage with market leaders to push through the technology transition and commercialization."

Nuclear systems are used in power generation, defense and national security. With such, there is demand of sensor which can help in reliably running the nuclear system and prevent catastrophe. In high radiation field, most of the sensor systems show degradation and under failure, therefore reliability of sensor performance is always in question. In this regard, Department of Energy (DOE) has shown interest and grown support in the improvements and advancement of advanced sensors and instrumentations which can directly support existing power reactors, material test reactors and other similar systems. The desired technology should demonstrate greater accuracy, reliability, resilience and ease of replacement and upgrades for applications in nuclear environments. X-wave Innovations, Inc. (XII), along with TechOpp Consulting Inc. (TOC), proposes to develop a Radiation Endurance Ultrasonic Transducer (REUT) for nuclear applications. The proposed REUT development is based on selecting radiation resilient materials, material engineering and harnessing knowledge of acoustic propagation in materials. The key innovation of the proposed REUT approach lays in the development of metal backing for ultrasonic transducers whose electrical and acoustic characteristics will be comparable to the conventional ultrasonic transducers. Our approach combines the concepts of material engineering and acoustic propagation in materials, are exploited to its best in REUT design, delivering a ultrasonic transducer which is resilient to radiation and can operate in other harsh conditions such as high temperatures. In Phase I, XII will revive the REUT development and perform detail design studies using simulations and precision machining task to develop REUT system with performance characteristics matching the conventional ultrasonic transducers. The primary consideration will be given to the development of backing material which is the heart of the REUT. The performance testing will involve evaluation of REUT working and comparison studies with the available commercial ultrasonic transducers. Improvement in the REUT design will be made based on the performance tests and comparison studies. XII counts with the necessary technical and scientific expertise to carry on a detail analytical and simulation-based design as well as implementing the design in development of a sensor prototype meeting all specification and requirements. We envision the success of the end product and a strong intellectual property portfolio.XII has a clear transitioning plan for the proposed technology. The outcome of the proposed work is an ultrasonic transducer which will have a high tolerance and extended life in high temperatures, and other harsh conditions including extreme radiation. The specially designed ultrasonic transducer can be replacing with the conventional ultrasonic transducers which usually have short performance life span in harsh conditions. The potential application of the proposed technology is in nuclear industry, such as, nuclear reactors (both domestic and military), nuclear waste management, nuclear war heard, handling radioactive materials used national security, medicine and research. The proposed technology can find application in non-nuclear field as well, such as, chemical processing, metal industry, refinery, oil & petroleum industry, charge particle accelerators etc. We anticipate the social and economic benefits of the proposed system are enormous."

Our approach enhances the safety and prognostics associated with lithium-ion batteries, and its reconstruction capability has the added benefit of rejuvenating a cell to extend its life. Finally, the proposed solution will be implemented on small, low cost, and low power hardware to ensure its seamless integration to existing commercial cells and systems."

Most existing quality assurance methods involve an inspection of the finished part rather than online quality control, leaving a need for an online inspection system that can assist in the amelioration of flaws during the manufacturing process. Thus, a monitoring method to optimize the manufacturing process, increase part quality and reduce time/energy spent on post-process quality control/remanufacture is highly desirable. In this proposal, X-wave Innovations, Inc.

The end result of ACUAS is to provide high- resolution ultrasonic images of AM part properties which are subsequently used to augment the AM process control parameters (e.g. laser speed/power) resulting in the compensation of manufacturing defects. In Phase I, XII will prototype a system and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed ACUAS technique for in-situ, measurement and feedback control of powder bed AM process. The focus of the Phase I program will be the overall ACUAS system design and prototyping, including design of the transducer array, signal/image processing algorithms, derived measurement of part properties, and feedback control strategies. The proposed ACUAS provides a means of measuring, and compensating defects formed in parts resulting from a powder bed AM process. The enabling technique will allow a fundamental understanding of the relationship between process parameters, and the formation of defects, as well as a means of ameliorating those defects so that they do not lead to failure of the finalized components. Thus, the proposed ACUAS system will have a significant impact on many industrial and military applications, as AM is being adopted rapidly in nearly all fields. Of particular interest to the DOE, would be the application of ACUAS in the AM of polycrystalline diamond compact drill bits for oil and gas exploration/extraction, or in the production of gas turbine fuel injectors."

Lithium-based batteries will continue to play a key role as an electric propulsion source due to their high energy and power densities. However, the requirement to advance towards more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly aircrafts demands battery systems that can operate for longer periods of time in a safer and more reliable manner. Efforts within the commercial aviation sector also indicate strong interest in this area. As an example, Boeing is developing hybrid airplanes as part of the Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft project funded by NASA, and has also developed the first hybrid electric airplane in cooperation with Cambridge University. On the battery monitoring and control area, focus has been mostly aimed at achieving accurate and stable long-term estimation of cell State of Charge, State of Health, and Remaining Useful Life. These efforts have achieved excellent progress, and accuracies below 3% error are common today.

The overall envelope dimensions and locations of interface fittings and attachment elements such as lacing ferrules and hanger baskets are critical to the proper function and durability of the fuel cells. The existing method of dimensional inspection is to install the fuel cells in a facsimile structure and evaluate the fit of the cell within the facsimile structure.

In this proposal, X-wave Innovations, Inc. (XII) propose a handheld, non-contact, three-dimensional (3D) measurement system (called SnapSCAN). The SnapSCAN utilizes a unique design based on our 3D scanner that has a MEMS laser projector and a split lens 3D sensor, allowing much faster and accurate measurements than any other handheld devices on the market. The key innovation of the proposed SnapSCAN is the integration of 3 state-of-the-art technologies (including 3D scanning and measurement technology, MEMS laser color image projection technology, and ultra compact computer technology) into one compact, handheld device. It is a true standalone system that requires neither additional assistant component for 3D data stitching, dedicated computer for calculation, nor wired power supply. It can replace two different gauges on the market: Protrusion/Flushness Gauge (Analog or Digital) and Countersink Gauge (Analog or Digital). It can provide high accuracy comprehensive analysis results. The system startup time is only a few seconds. There is no need for any pre-setups such as system calibrations. The measurement time for a fastener can be less than one second. BENEFIT: The key advantage of the proposed handheld SnapSCAN is the non-contact nature, which eliminates the possibilities of damaging the fastener and surrounding surfaces during scanning and measurement, improves accuracy, and eliminates sources of human error. The image guided quick measurement can interactively guide the operator to find the optimal location for the scanner, make measurement and show the results in real-time. By whole surface measurement, it can provide accurate and comprehensive results that are impossible by other tools. The measurement results can be interactively displayed and be instantly saved to local hard drive or to wireless network storages."

The potential outcome of this project is a comprehensive line of robotic ultrasound transducers that enable a variety of interventional point-of-care robotic applications by enhancing the skills of a multitude of clinicians. As a result, many technically challenging critical procedures will no longer be restricted to solely highly trained experts. Applications include central vascular access (pediatric and adult), biopsy, regional anesthesiology, precision extraction (e.g. thoracentesis), and precision injections (e.g. orthopedic biologics), creating an addressable market exceeding $2 billion. Benefits of man-machine teaming using hand-held medical robots include faster, simpler procedures that can be performed by a much broader group of clinicians, reduced medical complications and patient discomfort, and improved hospital infrastructure utilization, ultimately benefitting both clinical outcomes and total costs of care. Significant insights and implications for other man-machine teaming applications may also result from this project, with potential for robotic applications well outside of the medical realm. The intellectual merit of this project centers on demonstrating the feasibility of first-of-kind hand-held robotic capabilities for autonomous needle placement. This project builds on two existing layers of innovation. First is the ability to use real-time ultrasound data to send a needle precisely to a point in the body. This differs significantly from other imaging modalities that require multiple images from different orientations integrated ""off line."" Next, this is an autonomous and powered system. Once a user selects a target, the needle path is calculated and the needle is advanced automatically. This project builds the third level of innovation through its research objectives - creating the real-time ability to i) recognize and track the target as an object, and ii) make automatic robotic corrections to maintain that target during user or patient movement or changes in target characteristics. The research involves novel image recognition and tracking technology and very precise novel sensing and control loop technology that interact in real time to maintain targeting accuracy in a dynamic environment.

In cell culture, they provide for bench top or high throughput screening applicable to gene regulation, pathway discovery, target validation, drug discovery, and cellular target efficacy. Used in vivo with whole animal imaging, they provide for temporal and quantitative analysis of drug delivery and in vivo target efficacy. The most commonly used reporter-gene assays place an easily monitored reporter gene such as a fluorescent protein or luciferase downstream to cloned promoter and transcriptional regulatory elements. In an exogenousreporter, the vector is introduced into recipient cells where expression proceeds either transiently, or after  random  and stable integration into the genome. Exogenous reporter-gene assays are highly unpredictable, and often incapable of indexing geneexpression to known regulatory agents. They can provide erroneous data and mislead research investigations, thereby costing time, expense and unrealized discovery and development opportunities. In contrast, in an endogenous reporter, reporter genes are introduced at their normal chromosomal locus where native promoters, regulatory elements, local chromosomal modifications and micro-RNA regulatory sequences are utilized to reliably and accurately index gene regulation. However, very few endogenous human gene- expression reporter cell assays are available and sensitivity limits accurate monitoring of many genes. Compounding this, current gene trapping and gene targeting methods for producing assays require large investments in resources, time, and cost, making them unattainable for most laboratories. In phase I studies, we propose to combine Xactagen's prior research advances in reporter cell sensitivity with innovative methods to mass produce, store and retrieve endogenous, human gene expression reporter cells. Our hypothesis is that we will have extensive gene coverage, sensitivity to monitor expression of even poorly expressed genes, reliable responses to known gene regulators, and the ability to retrieve specific reporter cells from our libraries for delivery to researchers within 4-6 weeks of ordering. Our specific aims are: (1) Generate a pilot library of 19,200 arrayed gene-trapped reporter cells (NIH-H292 human mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line), (2) Identify vector insertion sites, and characterize gene/transcription unit representation, and (3) Retrieve 10 endogenous reporter cells and verify functionality. This innovative research provides for cost-effective and highly expedited production of human endogenous gene expression reporter cell libraries in weeks as opposed to years. As a result, more researchers will have access to endogenous human reporter cells and will be able to focus on cell culture and in vivo applications, rather than on production. Additionally, researchers can avoid exogenous reporter cells with their unpredictable indexing of gene expression. Ultimately, scientists will make more viable research and medical discoveries in less time and at far less cost. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current methods for production of endogenousgene expression reporter cells are laborious and cost- prohibitive. The ultimate goal of this research i to provide cost-effective and highly expedited production of human endogenous reporter cell libraries - in weeks as opposed to years. Hundreds of thousands of readily available, highly sensitive, easy to use, and affordable gene expression reporter cells produced in diverse human cell lines and stem cells are expected to increase productivity of scientific research and drug discovery."

Accordingly, approaches to slow AD progression are designed to prevent central nervous system (CNS) accumulation of Aa, either by pharmacological inhibition of its synthesis or by development of Aa vaccines and antibodies that augment clearance of Aa by microglia. Moreover, a secondary event in disease pathology results from release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and neurotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) by microglia in response to activation by Aa. Although several drug discovery approaches show promise in suppressing Aa ??accumulation, drug candidates derived from many of these approaches have side effects that remain problematic. In this SBIR study, we will discover agents which target unexploited pathways to both promote the reduction of Aa in AD brain and suppress the associated neuroinflammation. Specifically, we will: 1) Develop high throughput assays using human microglial cell lines to measure Aa phagocytosis and screen small molecule libraries of known drugs, bioactives and drug-like compounds to discover compounds that promote Aa phagocytosis, 2) Develop assays to measure production of mediators of neuroinflammation and test whether compounds found to augment Aa phagocytosis can suppress production of Aa induced mediators of neuroinflammation in human microglial cell lines and primary human microglia, and 3) Compounds found to augment Aa induced phagocytosis and suppress Aa induced mediators of neuroinflammation in cell culture are tested for their ablility to induce primary human microglia to clear Aa from clinically relevant post-mortem brain tissues obtained from AD patients. After completion of this Phase I project, the necessary AD assays, proof of concept for small molecule intervention, and required expertise for additional studies will be in place for identification and optimization of lead drug candidates in Phase II. Project In the United States, 4.5 million people have Alzheimer's Disease (AD) where direct and indirect costs of care are estimated at $100 billion annually.

This will in turn result in the creation of lower cost for unique and small batch parts thereby reducing overall cost in these critical areas. Presently very slow print speed is a universal concern for 3D printing processes. By substantially speeding up the 3D process and reducing the amount of waste, the economic break-even point, where the cost of 3D printing equals the cost of plastic injection molding, is reached for a much smaller number of parts. The system cost is also expected to be similar or less than the system cost of present 3D systems while the materials cost is comparable to present methods since very similar powdered thermoplastic materials are used. The extremely high process speeds achievable with this innovative technology, coupled with the fact that this approach will work with full color thermoplastic materials, makes this a potential game changer for additive manufacturing. This project uses the technology found in office laser printers. This technology has never been used before in rapid prototyping systems. There have been previous attempts to harness laser printing technology but they have all found it difficult to make parts thicker than about a quarter inch. This project is a radical innovation in the application of the technology in that it separates two critical functions, transfer and consolidation, that have always been combined in previous attempts to use the technology. This innovation enables much greater control of both functions in a way that resolves the problem of building thicker parts by making the process look much more like that used in a laser printer. The innovation also allows the 3D printing of parts to be up to five times faster than any existing method. The anticipated technical result is to build multi-layer blocks of material quickly and uniformly layer by layer. The process does also include the capability to support parts during build.

It is based on a major breakthrough achieved at Xacton. This has led to the fabrication of wafers of Mercury Cadmium Telluride with a very high level of crystalline perfection, very low defect density and extremely uniform in composition, wavelength and other properties. This has resulted in the fabrication of sensors with unmatched performance at elevated temperatures, including room temperature operation. Some of the disadvantages of the Cryo-coolers are that they have only a limited lifetime, are not very reliable, and are heavy and expensive. Therefore, their elimination in the space-based surveillance systems can make the system much simpler to design and fabricate, with increased reliability and lifetime, and also result in considerable cost reduction. In Phase I, we plan to fabricate and deliver 3 - 5 micron detectors with excellent performance at elevated temperatures, e.g., 30C to -70C. In Phase II, it will lead to the fabrication of sensors that can be used in actual Space-Based Surveillance Systems without the use of ryo-coolers or uncooled."

Xage Security Fabric provides a multi-vendor security fabric for role-based access control for connected grid infrastructure (RTUs, automated switches and relays) saving time and money for IT, OT administrators, and field technicians while also providing a higher level of protection against a cyberattack or potential compromise. The Xage Security Fabric is an overlay to the utilityâs or vendors security and operational infrastructure and provides unified identity based access management by synthesizing security policies centrally while distributing the enforcement functions at the industrial edge. This end to end zero trust methodology allows near real-time policy updates allowing operations to onboard crews from other utilities who need local login access for restoration efforts. With this approach, credential management and authentication is managed and enforced in the fabric instead of the various field laptops and eliminates poor security practices associated with unmanaged credentials or open access to last mile grid devices. Demonstrate an identity based security fabric for unified access control that provides a central policy manager and decentralized enforcement for unified access management and authentication. Develop a secure communication subsystem fabric endpoint with the ability to receive and securely store credentials at the infrastructure edge (pole mounted devices) enabling field technician (inclusive of auxiliary crews) secure access and audits. The benefit of this project is significant across a number of stakeholder groups, including the overall public. Utilities will be able to adopt a zero trust OT model to manage security enforcement controls across the entire distribution grid infrastructure and enforce access control policies consistently which creates a more cyber resilient grid. The security fabric concept for OT will allow utilities to provide more cost effective protection to their infrastructure in a way that still allows for choice in suppliers, reduction in IT infrastructure, capital and operational expenditures allowing for increased investment in modernization efforts for the overall public."

The current electrical grid is transforming from a centralized design to one that is decentralized, transactional and includes many more stakeholders from a consumer and generation standpoint. Xage Security Fabric technology provides a blockchain protected security fabric for any to any information exchange for devices, apps, people and data required to secure this distributed grid architecture while also securing legacy assets already deployed. These legacy assets typically have poor to no security controls and are becoming more connected to industrial IoT infrastructures creating attack vectors for nation states and nefarious actors. The public benefit is to prevent the disruption of energy services by securing the nationâs critical infrastructure from foreign and domestic enemies planning cyber attacks. This approach reduces costs for grid operations through business and operational process transformation, preserving investment in deployed infrastructure, and promoting interoperability between systems. A secondary benefit to the public can be realized though reduced utility costs often filed as part of a rate base by the utility, as well as, enabling adoption of distributed generation by securing advanced peer to peer control software to support the introduction of microgrids and other distributed generation infrastructure. The proposed project will demonstrate and characterize how the characteristics of a blockchain based application can provide security for legacy and modern grid assets by creating identities and controlling access to assets from multiple vendors. The enforcement of policies created and secured in the blockchain will include both center to edge and distributed peer to peer interactions between devices and applications using common industrial protocols. A solution does not exist today that offers a combination of these capabilities. A scalability study will also be conducted to characterize performance and attributes needed for a decentralized blockchain architecture if deployed in a typical distribution grid. Todayâs security methodology and tools used in both information and operational technology are built on the premise of connectivity to a central location and centralized control. The distributed nature of blockchain technology makes a decentralized security model possible at significant scale. The security use cases demonstrated by this project will address Industry 4.0 innovations that rely on industrial control systems becoming more connected and autonomous.

Some of the more interesting applications of these networks depend on the ability to produce entanglement in a form that enables the implementation of teleportation and entanglement swapping protocols. In the absence of quantum memories, this requires the production of entanglement in tight time windows that enables the execution of joint measurements among photons from independent sources. This project aims to develop a high-quality pulsed source that avoids the use of large lasers typically used in teleportation and entanglement swapping demonstrations. The existence of such a source will be important for the establishment of long-distance quantum networks, particularly for eventual satellite applications. SQT will use its existing CubeSat format entanglement source as a starting point for developing this pulsed, low SWaP entanglement source."

To share symmetric encryption keys between two remote ground stations, the satellite can create separate keys at the two sites, then reconcile the keys between them. This implies that the satellite needs to know both keys, making it a trusted node. Ultimate security is achieved by simultaneously creating keys using two quantum channels from a satellite, known as double downlink QKD. This is the ultimate in security because the satellite does not need to be trusted.

The resulting products will allow customers to perform a rich range of tests at the nano-scale at costs and times that are a small fraction of those required for conventional platforms such as scanning electron microscopes (SEM), scanning probe microscopes (SPM), and a range of automated test equipment (ATE) based on these technologies. Miniaturization across a range of sectors is driving the development of devices and materials at increasingly minute length scales. Multiple large-scale trends including mobile devices and the internet-of-things are driving an unprecedented volume of engineering at the nanoscale. Much of this is now dependent on the single-tip SPM that has evolved into a broad array of instruments for the analysis of physical, chemical and electrical properties, and to detect and isolate flaws. The Multiple Integrated Tips (MiT) technology that is the focus of this effort takes a radically different approach to enable an even richer range of tests at length scales below one micron, with a faster, simpler and much more cost-effective platform. Given a large install-base of capital equipment, we are focused on probes coupled with adapters that plug into the most popular SEMs and SPMs. These probes significantly expand the functionality of existing systems, and do this with low barriers to acceptance given modest price points and seamless integration into standard industry platforms. A portfolio of probes will be developed to address high-volume needs across the semiconductor and thin film markets, starting with 4-tip devices for the electrical characterization of thin films, and configurable or non-configurable 3-4-tip devices for probing integrated circuits. These will be offered in a variety of sizes and geometries, currently from hundreds of nm to 65 nm, and extending below 10 nanometers within a year. In Phase II, probe functionality will be enhanced to enable coupled imaging and probing with design to operate in AFM mode. The portfolio of products will be continuously expanded to additional two- and three-dimensional geometries via co-development with lighthouse customers."

The underlying motivating factor stems from a lack of testing equipment with high resolution and sensitivity necessary for identifying faults as the semiconductor industry shrinks feature sizes to 10 nanometers and beyond. Successful development and use of the integrated device will allow engineers to understand the root cause of failure mechanisms of solid state devices at these advanced nodes. The commercial impact of this new capability for failure analysis on next-generation devices will be profound. The miniaturization of semiconductor devices has led to a decrease in the cost per transistor of seven orders of magnitude in the last 40 years, and new process and measurement technologies are needed to continue this trend. The reduction of transistor size enables high performance devices at a lower cost and lower power. The proposed multiple tip technology will enable the development of these advanced-node highly scaled transistors that will form the platform for the next generation of high-performance electronic devices such as personal computers, cell phones, and healthcare equipment. The intellectual merit of this project is the use of monolithically integrated scanning probes to facilitate the extension of semiconductor failure analysis to devices with feature sizes of ten nanometers or less. Crucially, conventional characterization and test methods are increasingly ineffective when applied to structures smaller than 100 nanometers, causing challenges for engineers in research and development, process control and failure analysis. Subtle defects become increasingly prominent drivers of failure as device size and operating margins decrease, e.g., processing anomalies in thin gate oxides, substrate problems related to doping, and line width variations. These issues can occur at length scales invisible to traditional scanning electron microscopy and optical-based tools, requiring novel approaches. The proposed multiple integrated tip devices leverage powerful nano-electro-mechanical capabilities and scale well even below 10 nanometers. In addition, cost effectiveness of the nanofabrication techniques, combined with monolithic integration of sensing structures and tailoring of the tips would enable robust, high-volume testing, a key need for the semiconductor industry. Research objectives include the fabrication of nanoscale multiple integrated tip devices, atomic force imaging of transistors and active electrical characterization of transistors. The anticipated result is accurate electrical characterization of transistor performance using the multiple integrated tip device."

The problem lies in the numerous parameters that can be used to identify the origin. To resolve this and meet its need, Xallent LLC proposes developing a database of unique device parameters and characteristics that can be used to successfully track the origin of fabrication of an electronic component. This identification process will be streamlined by focusing on distinct parameters such as the charge transport mechanism in transistor channel, induced strain around Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) structures, and dielectric integrity in Metal-Insulator-Metal capacitors. Physical observables such as via and STI etch angle profiles as well as transistor architecture will also be documented. The measurements from a novel multiple tip Scanning Probe System, invented and constructed by Xallent LLC, capable of performing Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Tip Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) and Nanoscale-Transconductance characterization, will then be used to evaluate the parameters. As a result, the work done in Phase I will entail the first time an integrated system is used for sequential atomic imaging, TERS and Nanoscale-Transconductance measurement in ambient air without the assistance of a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)."

XT-101 is a non-viral form of gene therapy that causes the meningeal cells surrounding the spinal cord to secrete the powerful, natural, anti- inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10). Based on extensive pre-clinical research, Xalud believes that the secreted IL-10 will reduce inflammation and normalize the pathological microglia and astrocyte activity that is seen in MS. Xalud proposes to study XT-101 in both inflammatory and neurodegenerative rodentmodels of MS and to conduct various cell and tissue analyses to better understand and elucidate the biological effects of XT-101. Xalud expects to demonstrate in these models that XT-101 reduces motor impairment, alleviates gait disorders and resolves neuropathic pain. Xalud also expects that XT-101 will have a positive effect on numerous elements of MS pathology including: immune cell infiltration, inflammation, reduced glutamate transport, demyelination, and neuronal apoptosis. Support of the proposed studies would greatly accelerate the development of XT-101 for clinical applications. Xalud is currently conducting IND-enabling toxicology studies for the use of XT-101 in neuropathic pain and expects to file an IND in late 2013. The additional efficacy dataprovided by the proposed studies would support the initiation of human trials of XT-101 in neuropathic pain, gait disorders and possibly other MS-related indications. Xalud believes that XT-101, if successfully developed, could have a tremendous impact onthe clinical treatment of MS and greatly improve the quality of life MS patients. Neuropathic pain and gait disorders impact almost all MS patients and greatly reduce their ability to participate in society and enjoy life. Further, XT-101 may slow diseaseprogression in the currently untreatable progressive forms of MS. Because the method of action of XT-101 is markedly different from all existing or imminent MS treatments, it has the potential to be an extremely useful addition and complement to current medical practice.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Xalud Therapeutics, Inc. is seeking support to advance the development of XT-101 for the treatment of motor impairment, gait disorders and neuropathic pain associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). Currently, there are no treatments approved for MS-related neuropathic pain or for treating progressive forms of the disease and only one treatment approved for gait disorders. By addressing these areas of tremendous unmet clinical need,Xalud believes XT-101 can greatly improve the quality of life of MS patients."

The system uses radio tomography (RT), i.e., the changes in radio signal strength (RSS) measurements on the static links of the network over time, to localize and track stationary and moving targets. In a wooded environment, a major challenge is represented by the environmental noise, i.e., the changes in RSS introduced by e.g. wind and rain. In this project, we will demonstrate noise reduction algorithms capable of learning the characteristics of the environmental noise and filtering it from the collected RSS signals. This allows the system to detect a person crossing a link line despite the environmental noise. Moreover, in remote wooded areas, the battery-powered RF sensors composing the system must function for an extended period of time (e.g., one year). We will address the issue of power efficiency first by developing a self-synchronizing communication protocol which enables radio duty-cycling. Second, the system will adaptively adjust the sampling (i.e., communication) rate of the sensors depending on the detection of significant events (i.e., intrusions of people in the monitored area). We will test large-scale deployments of RF sensors in wooded areas and process the collected data off-line to demonstrate the ability of our RT system to accurately track people as they move through the deployment area."

This project will develop new technologies that make the system useful for police team end-users to quickly deploy and use without extensive training. Specifically, the produce should investigate methods to achieve robust connectivity across larger buildings; develop capabilities for 2.5-dimensional (x,y + floor) imaging and tracking; develop adaptive estimation algorithms that automatically adjust to the environment; develop devices suited for rapid deployment, and develop a real-time commercial prototype including user interface. At the end of the project, the combination of these developments should allow delivery of a prototype to a SWAT team for them to deploy and use on their own in a training exercise. The broader/commercial impact is the commercialization of a technology for police and SWAT (special weapons and tactics) teams to quickly obtain situational intelligence that will save lives. Lives are lost every year because law enforcement officers do not know what is happening inside a building prior to entering. In addition, other life-saving applications will benefit from technologies developed, for example: military urban operations; building security and homeland security systems; finding people alive in collapsed buildings or during fire rescue; and worker safety systems. The firms technology is also useful in systems that allow elderly to live longer in their own home by monitoring their activities to ensure their safety and health. The proposed solution to these challenges is uniquely useful because it does not require a person to wear or carry any device, and cannot image a person's face or features, thus preserving privacy. The technology is capable of ""seeing"" through walls, even in the dark or through smoke.

The sensor is contact-free, i.e., a person does not need to remember to wear it in order to be monitored. The system monitors links for changes in signal strength which indicate a person being near the line between two transceivers. Algorithms use the link information to infer the location of a person. With transceivers at two different heights, algorithms can distinguish whether a person is standing, sitting, or laying on the floor, and use the speed at which someone moves to the floor to detect a dangerous fall. Room-level tracking can also be used to look for unusual patterns which indicate physical or cognitive decline. This project will develop methods to minimize deployment time and expertise. It will develop novel algorithms that allow for a lower density of transceivers in the system, and still achieve room-level tracking and fall detection accuracy. Live demonstrations will be conducted with potential investors and customers. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the ability for the sensor to increase the ability of an elder to safely age-in-place in their preferred living environment, benefitting them and reducing the costs of nursing home care. Unfortunately, many older people fall each year, often when alone, resulting in long delays before help arrives. The fear of falling and being unable to get help is a reason many enter nursing care. Older adults at risk for cognitive decline (e.g., dementia) could live independently longer with sensing systems that help caregivers monitor their well-being. Beyond aging-in-place, these technologies have application in hospitals; smart-building systems for automation and energy efficiency; security systems; retail analytics; and generally for context- and location- aware computing applications. Existing technologies use (1) wearable sensors, which are often forgotten, (2) video camera surveillance, which is seen as too invasive of privacy, or (3) infrared motion sensors, which do not detect falls and are prone to false alarms. In contrast, the proposed sensor does not need to be worn, reliably senses falls, and is privacy-preserving. Our sensor provides capabilities currently unavailable, and will be bought by aging-in-place monitoring and system integrator companies."

DFL locates people inside of a building using only simple radio devices deployed on the outside of the building. In a police or military operation, these devices are thrown or launched around the building, and then measure the received signal strength (RSS) between many pairs of devices. Within seconds of deployment, the DFL system shows a map tracking people and objects within the building. Such a system requires rapid deployment techniques and real-time operator-free network configuration. This project will advance the state-of-the-art in self-configuring and adaptive wireless networks. Methods for using reconfigurable antennas to direct the antenna pattern through the building regardless of how a sensor lands will be developed. For operator-free deployment, the network will have devices which self-localize, and learn the statistics of the particular radio channels to be measured. The combined results will show that tactically deployed wireless devices can be used to rapidly obtain intelligence regarding occupants before entering a dangerous building. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project are significant, as lives are lost every year because law enforcement officers do not know what is happening on the other side of a wall. If successful, this project will enable a product for police/SWAT and military special operations forces (SOF) which will save lives by providing actionable intelligence prior to entering a dangerous building. Existing radar technology for through-wall imaging is too expensive ($100k) for all but the most cost-insensitive applications. We plan a product that, because of its low cost, small size, and ease of use, will be standard equipment in police departments and in SOF teams.

Existing nanofiber technologies simultaneously produce at low throughputs and apply NFs at very slow line speeds (~1-30 m/min) as a low basis weight surface coating onto nonwoven substrates. Due to the inefficient delivery and high costs of NFs, they are commercially only used in high-end applications in filtration, acoustics, medical, energy and textiles. By separately producing bulk NFs and developing methods to efficiently spray them at high rates (>150 m/min) inline, the significant value of NF?s can be more widely applied to the US nonwovens manufacturing sector. The key research objectives include developing methods to disperse NFs for wet or dry spraying, determining how to spray NFs using commercially available equipment, and testing the value that sprayed nanofibers add to air filtration and acoustic nonwoven products. It is anticipated that methods to spray and disperse NFs will be developed and pilot spraying equipment design requirements will be determined as a result of this research. The broader impact / commercial potential of this project could unleash the high value that NFs can add to nonwoven products by spraying bulk, short-length polymeric nanofibers (NFs) inline at full line speeds (>150 m/min) in nonwoven manufacturing processes using commercially-available spraying hardware. The NF spraying equipment would be a fraction of the hardware costs compared to existing electrospinning and melt blowing NF technologies. Recently a novel transformative NF closed-loop chemical production process has been scaled up and it addresses a fundamental limitation of current NF processes ? high throughput off-line production of short length NFs. Spraying nanofibers at full nonwoven line speeds would accelerate the growth rate (estimated at 34% per year) of the existing $176 million market for nanofibers. In the $6.6 billion air filtration market, this novel NF spraying technology will be a key to improving filter efficiency and lowering costs through new improved products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The first target markets for spraying nanofibers in-line will be for air filtration and acoustics applications. The broader impact of developing nanofiber spraying capabilities will make the US nonwoven industry more competitive worldwide and improve North Carolina?s economy through job creation."

Additive manufacturing (AM) offers the potential to realize the production of monolithic components while significantly reducing investments of resources including time, effort, and money. This project will target AM of large, complex 3D structures made of metal and alloy. At present, there is little data on high-vacuum properties of such build products. This deficit inhibits the use of direct energy deposition (DED) processes, which are well suited for rapid builds of large 3D products. Resolving this fundamental technology gap is a key factor motivating this effort. Numerous research and development (R&D) applications, both within fusion science and in other fields, require production of high-vacuum compatible components made of metals and alloys. Additive manufacturing can improve, over traditional methods, the fabrication and performance of the components. It (a) enables production of a 3D geometry as a single component from a 3D CAD model, (b) enables structures that can't be built with traditional methods, and (c) offers the potential to more rapidly and cost effectively realize a complex structure. Our aim is to leverage capabilities of cutting-edge hybrid-DED AM, to: advance processes capable of rapid and economical 3D builds of metals and alloys; develop, identify, and experimentally qualify single refractory metal and metal alloy build formulas suitable for high-vacuum applications, using components fabricated using arc/laser wire-fed/powder-fed DED processes; and merge the compilation into solutions enabling AM of high-vacuum chambers and components."

Transimpedance amplifiers (TIA) are widely utilized in experimental and commercial applications for this task. Numerous detection systems require wide bandwidth, ultra-low noise, high gain, and linear amplification. Commercial TIAs having this combination of features are surprisingly not readily available and many consumers resort to costly and time consuming in-house development. We propose to develop ultra-low noise, wide bandwidth, high gain, transimpedance amplifiers (TIA). This will be achieved via the development of an Advanced-TIA Platform - a circuit designed (using surface mount technology) to achieve linear amplification of current 1 nA, signal bandwidth 5 MHz (-3dB), equivalent input-noise ~ 1.5 nA (rms), and transimpedance (gain) 107 V/A. This exacting set of specifications is not readily available in commercial products. It will, furthermore, have the capacity to be adapted to a range of specifications, enabling custom performance metrics to be fulfilled. This platform will be developed into a Plug-and-Play device that is compact and vacuum-grade; attributes that are beneficial to scientific R & amp;D applications. During the Phase-I period we developed a circuit that established the feasibility of our Advanced-TIA concept; we accomplished this by computer modeling the circuit, evaluating its performance, prototyping the device and demonstrating its performance. During Phase-II we will mature the Advanced-TIA circuit into a Platform and construct the Plug-and-Play device. This significance of this effort is captured in the following: 1) It will result in novel TIA products suitable for communication, science, and service industries within government and private sector markets; 2) It has broad inherent value within the scientific R & amp;D sector and is likely to attract future development funding; 3) Other benefits to the federal and private scientific R & amp;D programs include less time spend on in-house development, cost savings, and greater programmatic productivity."

Current-to-voltage converters (I/Vs) are widely utilized in experimental and commercial applications for this task. Numerous detection systems require wide bandwidth, ultra-low noise, high gain, and linear amplification. Commercial I/Vs having this combination of features are surprisingly not readily available and many consumers resort to costly and time consuming in-house development. These factors, reflected presently within the heavy ion beam probe (HIBP) program supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Fusion Energy Sciences, motivate this effort. We propose to develop ultra-low noise, wide bandwidth, high gain, transimpedance amplifiers (TIA). They emanate from a design developed and used successfully by the HIBP program for over 25 years. Noteworthy characteristics will include linear amplification of current 1 nA, signal bandwidth 1 MHz (-3dB), equivalent input-noise ~ 1.5 nA (rms), and transimpedance (gain) 107 V/A. They will also be compact, vacuum grade (operable at 10-7 torr), and smartly-packaged. Contemporary methods, including computerized circuit modeling and surface-mount technology (SMT), will be used to achieve these state-of-the-art products. This significance of this effort is captured in the following; 1) It will advance heavy ion beam probe diagnostic capabilities, furthering fusion energy science; 2) It will result in novel TIA products suitable for communication, science, and service industries within government and private sector markets; and 3) It has broad inherent value likely to attract future development funding. This work is critical to realization of innovative Heavy Ion Beam Probe detectors and measurements under development within the O.F.E.S Diagnostic Program including: 1) Development of modern detector systems, enabling the HIBP to characterize /n and  electrostatic fluctuation induced transport with greater than prevailing resolution; 2) Incorporation of more populous detector/aperture sets into energy analyzers, enabling the HIBP to achieve a better understanding of wavenumbers (k_nn, k_ and low-k fluctuations; 3) Development of a particle velocity detector, advancing the unique HIBP capability to measure the poloidal magnetic flux (t) and infer the evolution of the current density and q-profiles; 4) Development of wider bandwidth measurements, extending the frequency sensitivity of the HIBP to enable assessment of quantities not currently accessible; and 5) Advancement of HIBP detector technology toward a smaller and more economical alternative to an electrostatic analyzer (an option that may make the HIBP realizable on a larger number of devices). Near term benefits of this work will be realized in the U.S. fusion program domestically (with the HIBP operating on MST) and through an emerging international partnership with the Max-Plank Institute in Germany (and plans to operate HIBPs on ASDEX-U and W7-X). HIBPs having enhanced capabilities will access a wider range of quantities required for validation efforts and have broader impact within the fusion program. The new detection elements and measurements are central to these opportunities and Advanced-TIAs are vital to their success."

The biosensor wouldconsist of a sample lysis and electronic hybridization/release chamber fluidically connected to an electrochemical flow cell for detection, and would incorporate Xanthon's patented platform technology of electrochemical detection of nucleic acids. Withthis method, specific target nucleic acid species captured by oligo capture probes are directly detected by the electrochemical oxidation of guanine, an endogenous component of the nucleic acid targets. This provides a method of rapid, highly sensitive,and specific DNA detection without the need for complicated sample purification procedures, exogenous labels, labile reagents, or expensive, heavy, power-hungry instrumentation. Upon successful demonstration of the feasibility of the basic components,plans for further miniaturization and integration of the components will proceed toward development of a rugged, easy-to-use handheld unit that will take further advantage of the power and simplicity of direct electrochemical detection, in addition to theeconomy of time, space, and reagents made possible by microfluidics and electronic hybridization. In addition to military applications, development of such devices would provide prompt detection of potential bio-terrorist attacks, and find wide applicationfor the detection of pathogens in medical diagnostics, point-of-care clinical settings, food production, environmental monitoring, agriculture, and various industrial settings."

Our overall objective is to design, develop and pilot the prototype of a novel electronic-health record (EHR)-enabled standards-based mobile health information technology to enable earlier, detailed, and continuous identification of SDoH barriers among individuals with cancer; prioritize actionable social needs; incorporate the collected and prioritized SDoH data into the clinical workflow; and facilitate the connection of the individuals to the most relevant and needed community-based organizations and social supportive services to reduce the burden of disease for patients, their families, their physicians and clinical practices. Our technical objectives are (1): Design and prototype a tool that enables the convenient, secure and user-friendly collection of comprehensive data on SDoH from patients via mobile health technology and makes it available as discrete fields within an EHR to drive customized decisions for patients. (2): Integrate the SDoH data with an intelligent community referral system that will serve as a âconnectorâ to match patient needs to social support services and community-based organizations.

adjusted for body surface area (BSA). Unfortunately, while this may be adequate for the average person, it can be inappropriate for the majority of patients. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors are key components contributing to drug toxicities. Variations in metabolic enzyme activity have been shown to be responsible for toxicity in a number of anticancer agents including amonafide. Amonafide showed significant promise in treating metastatic breast cancer in the 1990's. However, unpredictable toxicity produced by N-acetylation limited development. We and others have previously developed dosing nomograms for amonafide in an effort to both reduce toxicity and increase response. In our phase I proposal, we developed a rapid method for NAT2 phenotyping. Here in phase II, we will use this method to develop a new acetylator-based dosing nomogram with individualized dosing levels aimed at the treatment of refractory breast cancer. We will refine our theoretical nomogram by adjusting dosing levels on the basis of myelosuppression. This adjusted dosing nomogram will then be used to select amonafide doses in an 80 patient cohort. Our goal is to demonstrate that our acetylator-based dosing nomogram will minimize variability in toxicity and increase the probability of positive therapeutic outcome."

Given the global ID nature of email addresses, email has become the most popular communication vehicle for document exchange. This approach has four fundamental shortcomings: proliferation of disaggregated versions of documents, lack of security (the email protocol is not encrypted), unreliable delivery of attachments, and expensive growth of email storage and staff support. This project develops an email server filter that strips attachments from messages and stores them on cheaper file servers instead of expensive email storage. Messages (sent or received) can be modified so that each attachment is replaced by a secure link and the attached documents can be tracked and managed. Xapio designed a system architecture and user interfaces that harness the best features of email, web, and file systems: this includes a system that supports shared metadata between files and emails, secure links to permanent objects, and email based authentication, and a set of browser user interfaces that converge the file and email experience. By adding these capabilities to a system, it is possible to deliver all benefits without changing IT infrastructure, install desktop applications, or changing user habits. That is, Users can securely and reliably send any size file to anyone from their email client (i.e. Outlook). Recipients retrieve the files with their email client or any browser. The sender can track downloads. If successful, this project has the potential to significantly impact email cost, security and reliability."

The radiator will be suitable for use on instruments carried by future spacecraft. The phase I effort will address the thermal performance and size limitations of the composite design. Since cryogenic applications are becoming more common the thermal characteristics of the radiator will be measured down to 45K. Modern spacecraft thermal control needs to be low mass and low cost. Composite thermal radiators will realize a greater than 60% weight saving compared to aluminum and the costs can be addressed by the use of standard technology that can be easily applied to new designs. The major innovation to be demonstrated by this project is the use of highly orientated fibers that completely eliminates the low through thickness thermal conductivity normally associated with traditional carbon fiber laminates. This highly oriented lay-up also allows the thickness of the radiator to be tapered down to less than 0.020"" while retaining very high stiffness. Therefore, the radiator is much thinner than the equivalent aluminum radiator, which combined with lower density of composite construction, accounts for the significant weight reduction."

Project Summary The recent advances in pluripotent stem cell (PSC) technology enable researchers to establish human tissue derived cellular platforms for toxicity testing that are capable of providing information on mechanism of action, while facilitating the incorporation of broad genetic diversity and clinically validated disease conditions. We and other investigators have shown that it is possible run neurotoxicity screens with primary cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and obtain consistent and reliable results that offer advantages over screens run in cell lines or in rodent cells. The limiting factors in translating this technology into a commercial product have been an inability to establish large-scale reproducible protocols for generation and differentiation of PSCs and access to large collections of genetically diverse well-phenotyped cell lines. In this proposal, we aim to develop a fully automated platform for production of PSC-derived cells in a 96-well format utilizing a genetically diverse bank of cell lines. The large-scale approach will improve the statistical precision in the readouts and provide for parallel production not previously obtainable, which will translate into more predictive models. The product will be available to customers as a service for in-house screening of compounds or we can provide 96-well plates of iPSC-derived NSCs and DA neurons - vials of cells with instructions for plating and initial characterization will also be available. Plates will be generated from either a single cell line for initial screening of large numbers of compounds or independent cell lines from 96 healthy tissue donors representing the genetic diversity of the US population for hit validation. Analysis will include high-content image analysis of cell survival as well as transcriptional profiling. Our goal is to significantly reduce the costs of generating stem cell screening platforms and provide information that is more effective at predicting how human cells will respond to exposure to various toxicants during differentiation and at mature cell states. Our product will support the goals of the funding mechanisms, while also establishing a baseline of variation of transcription for neurallineages that will be critical when determining the significance of toxic effects of chemical compounds or developmental differences when analyzing diseased lines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this application, we aim to develop a fully automated platform for production of PSC-derived neuronal cells in a 96-well format from one (initial screen) and 96 (validation) individuals representing the genetic diversity of the US population.

The Ohio State University is committed to the modeling, optimization, and characterization of RF circuits, meta-materials, and novel antenna arrays. In this program, XCOM and OSU team up to develop phased array antennas based on OSU's tightly-coupled broadband arrays, with beam steering performed by piezoelectric MEMS circuits being commercialized under a U.S. Army CRADA. In Phase I, the team scaled existing phase shifter and array architectures to the 24.5-27 GHz band to meet program requirements, and test structures were fabricated. No incompatibilities of bandwidth, reliability, lifetime, size, or performance were found, and manufacturing constraints have already been folded back into design. In the Phase II effort, the K-band phased array will be prototyped, tested, and iterated, and a commercially attractive version spanning Ku and Ka bands will be developed and prototyped to meet the prime UAV EW and radar developer needs. These are critical technologies to support, as miniaturized phased arrays can lead to the rapid proliferation of low-cost government and commercial radar, EW, and communications systems with higher performance, smaller size, and reduced power consumption. BENEFIT: The electronically steerable antenna subsystems developed in this program will be used in UAV Electronic Warfare sensor systems, pre-shot sniper detection radar systems, communications test sets, and SATCOM systems. The direct benefits to the Department of Defense from supporting this effort include the rapid advancement of a low-cost phased array antenna that will greatly increase the EW and pre-shot sniper detection capabilities of UAVs and other platforms. When used in an EW sensor, for example, this subsystem could alert operators when their UAV is targeted by the handheld commercial radar systems now being used by asymmetric combatants and criminal entities. The system will provide slew-to-cue direction commands compatible with nearly all present camera and weapon systems deployed on UAVs and uUAVs today, at a target cost of only $10k.  Laboratory testing of small-form electronically steered antenna subsystems at Ku, K, and Ka bands will be completed within the timeline of the Phase II effort, with system-equivalent testing to TRL and MRL 5. Environment-equivalent range testing can be completed within 1 year to TRL and MRL 6-7. Phase III field testing and qualified production can begin within two years after Phase II.Additional future benefits will be realized down-stream using these technologies in reconfigurable radar, EW, and communication systems with forward-compatible architectures and software-defined waveforms and signal processing. These technologies accomplish power savings while improving data link quality, security, and EW resilience for our warfighters at reduced cost and component count.The greatest potential commercial benefits are substantial energy savings in cellular infrastructure, reducing carbon footprint. An estimated 10 million tons of CO2 can be eliminated within 5 years of the completion of Phase II if adopted by a single major carrier. Total addressable markets in 2015 for these technologies are projected at $1.4 billion across Government and civilian applications.

XCOR's composite material is lighter than metal, and unlike graphite/epoxy, nonflammable. The material is immune to microcracking, has a low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), and is capable of withstanding hundreds of cryogenic temperature cycles. Additionally, it is durable, repairable, and can withstand extreme hot and cold temperatures. The fluoropolymer composite maintains strength and flexibility at extreme temperatures (-260 to plus 280 degrees C/-436 to plus 536 degrees F).Low CTE also allows this composite to be built into a vehicle's primary structure. Used as the internal skin in a sandwich structure (Nonburnite, foam, and carbon/epoxy) the composite skin-foam-skin material provides both thermal insulation and structure.These features, along with the high strength-to-weight ratio, make it an enabling technology for building lighter, highly reusable, and more robust propellant tanks, thus reducing need for maintenance between flights. Further, XCOR believes significant commercialization opportunities exist for the material after its manufacturing processes have matured."

We will address the issues such as good thrust/weight ratio at small size, low toxicity propellants, and will demonstrate an increase in performance and maneuverability for microthruster technology compared to cold gas or monopropellants. The proposed propulsion system uses self-pressurizing nitrous oxide and ethane with specific impulse approximately 265 seconds for the smaller sizes and 280 seconds for the larger sizes where the injector geometry is more favorable for good mixing. XCOR has developed a 10 N thruster that will be modified with a high expansion vacuum nozzle and partial radiative cooling for this application. The technical objectives of the Phase I program will be to show a complete propulsion system design that masses 5 kg and has a useful propellant mass fraction.

Nitromethane has a density of 1.14 and the amount of low density oxygen needed for stable combustion is very low. Compared to nitrous oxide and ethane, this combination has higher density, and a greater range of storage temperatures. What is innovative about this approach is the combination of using desensitized nitromethane for better storage and handling properties, along with a new, small and light spark igniter, and just enough gaseous oxygen to permit reliable ignition and stable combustion of the fuel. Nitromethane has long been recognized as a high performance monopropellant, but is too sensitive for real-world tactical handling. If this fuel is desensitized for safety, it no longer works as a monopropellant because the catalysts no longer work. Adding oxygen to desensitized nitromethane and using spark ignition, making it a true bipropellant system, eliminates these problems at the expense of greater system complexity. Since a very small amount of oxygen is needed, the overall system density is reasonably high."

This Phase I/II STTR Fast Track proposal responds to the call from the 2018/2019 NCATS SBIR/STTR
Research Priorities to develop technologies so that ânew treatments and cures for disease can be delivered to
patients more quicklyâ. The production of life-altering gene editing vectors, cancer killing viruses, and life-
saving vaccines currently depends on traditional cell culture techniques. A number of virus-based and cell-
based therapies have become clinical treatments for cancer, for genetically-related blindness, for
immunodeficiency, and for inborn errors of metabolism. In this exciting field, many therapies being developed
are on waitlists to be tested. However, current cell culture-based production is costly and slow to attend the
existing demand. For instance, a clinical trial for AAV-based gene editing requires 10 viral particles, a
quantity currently requiring a year for production and costing 1-2 million dollars. Thus, the cost of $400,000 to
$1,400,000 per patient for recently approved gene medicines is not surprising. These price tags simply are not
sustainable for society. In the event of a pandemic, it would take years to generate sufficient doses of vaccines
to protect the 7 billion world population by current production methods. Thus, increasing the efficiency and
speed of culture of production cell lines are common goals for manufacturing of gene editing vectors, oncolytic
viruses, and vaccines. Our joint research efforts at XDemics Corporation, the California Institute of Technology,
and the City of Hope National Medical Center, have resulted in an improved method of cell culture. Based on a
known fact that oxygen delivery is the most rate-limiting process for increasing cell density, viability, and virus
production we created a novel high density cell respirator (HDCR) (US Patent no. 10,053,660) from highly
oxygen permeable material that can be inexpensively molded into large sheets, with integrated cell retention
architecture, for efficient membrane oxygenation of adherent or suspension cells. Our hypothesis is that
elimination of shear stress and the low flow media delivery through the HDCR, enabled by the decoupling of
gas exchange via membrane oxygenation of cells, will allow for improved yield, decreased cost, and increased
speed of production of therapeutic viral vectors and viruses. We have preliminary data confirming this
hypothesis and have produced prototypes for optimization. Herein we propose Phase I studies to optimize the
design of the HDCR for cell growth and demonstrate virus production. Proposed Phase II studies will consist of
research and development of production processes for multiple viral vectors, including AAV and immuno-
oncolytic poxvirus/vaccine. We expect that the HDCR will disrupt the field of vector and virus production, by
allowing andgt;10 times greater efficiency and andgt;2-10 times greater speed of production. Our long-term goal is to
speed up production of clinically-relevant quantities of viral medicines and vaccines from years down to
months. Decreasing the cost of gene therapy vectors, cell-based immunotherapies, and vaccines will
accelerate development of novel therapies for treating cancers, gene defects, and infectious diseases.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Current technologies to produce viral based medicines and vaccines are too expensive and too inefficient to
meet the demands of the growing field of genetic medicine, and will be unable to supply the global need for
vaccines if a pandemic occurs. Our research team at XDemics Corporation, the California Institute of
Technology, and the City of Hope National Medical Center has created a new technology for growing cells and
producing genetic medicines, named high density cell respirator (HDCR), which delivers oxygen and nutrients
separately, that should make it at least 10 times more efficient and two to ten times faster at producing viruses
and gene medicines, compared to current technologies. This project proposes to finalize the design of the
HDCR for widespread use and to design the production of two promising viral based medicines using the
HDCR in order to bring this more cost-effective and time-effective production method to clinical use."

These increases in efficiency are extremely important for applications in modern tactical aircraft, where any losses ultimately heat the fuel. As machine power levels increase to meet aircraft system demands, fuel temperature limits can lead to undesirable tradeoffs. One power loss mechanism that designers have not significantly reduced is windage losses. During Phase I, Xdot Engineering and Analysis analytically showed the feasibility of a new approach for reducing windage losses. During the Phase II effort, Xdot will optimize this approach and demonstrate optimized implementations in a full scale test rig at relevant speeds. The optimization effort will be performed using a CFD analysis that will be validated with new experimental windage loss data generated during the Phase II effort. The experimental portion of the project will be performed using a new windage loss test rig designed specifically to provide accurate rotor windage loss measurements at speeds of up to 60,000 RPM with full scale test hardware.  BENEFIT: The proposed Phase II effort will end with the demonstration of an optimized windage loss reduction technology suitable for use in a variety of high speed, electrical rotating machinery. This new windage loss reduction technology will help these machines meet increasingly challenging efficiency and total system power loss targets. The new Xdot technology does not increase system weight, is expected to have a reasonable integration cost, and is applicable to both induction and permanent magnet machines, including secondary or auxiliary power units, as well as main propulsion engine driven starter/generators. It also offer synergistic benefits with regards to rotor cooling. The effort to achieving this end goal will also include the generation of a high quality database of experimental windage loss measurements that is not currently available in the open literature, as well as a new validated design tool/module to help future machinery designers evaluate windage losses in this class of machinery. The initial commercial application of the new windage loss reduction technology is expected to be a commercial direct-drive compressor currently under development by a large original equipment manufacturer. A range of other commercial applications, including other high speed compressors, and waste heat energy recovery turbine generators are also being considered. Opportunities to apply the technology to electrical starting and generating machinery of specific Air Force interest will also continue to be pursued."

These losses are generally referred to as âwindage loss.â In some specific, high speed machines of particular interest to the aircraft community, it has been suggested that the losses could be as high as 10% to 15% of rated power. For the case of liquid cooled machinery in modern tactical aircraft, heat input at these levels can result in unacceptable fuel temperature rise, leading to undesirable performance tradeoffs. In this Phase I SBIR project, Xdot Engineering and Analysis proposes to investigate two innovative approaches for directly reducing these windage losses. The first is especially relevant to switched-reluctance machines such as those for aircraft applications. The second is relevant for a wider class of machines. Both can be applied with minimal or no change to the overall electrical/magnetic design of the machine. Applied individually, or in synergistic combinations, the aim is to achieve a reduction in windage power loss of at least a factor of 2, with a goal of an order of magnitude or more."

Although many approaches to prevent the symptoms of sickle cell disease (SCD) have been and currently are being explored, no method is approved for clinical use except administration of hydroxyurea, which is frequently toxic due to undesirable side effects, for sustained use by many patients. Thus, new methods for treatment of sickle cell disease are sorely needed. A safe and effective antisickling agent can reduce the effects of SCD, reduce medical costs and increase the life expectancies of sufferers of the disease. This SBIR phase I application is a drug development plan for preclinical studies of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (5HMF). 5HMF has been studied extensively, both in vitro and in vivo in a battery of preliminary tests by NHLBI SCD Reference Laboratory. It binds to HbS within RBCs and prevents sickling, both in vitro and in vivo. Preliminary in vivo studies with Tg sickle mice show that 5HMF is orally active with high bioavailability and has high red cell membrane permeability. 5HMF prolongs the life of severe hypoxic transgenic sickle cell (Tg) mice significantly and inhibits hypoxia induced sickling. Thus, 5HMF possesses a unique feature of antisickling action and clearly warrants further pre-clinical and toxicological investigation. Therefore, our specific aims include: (1) Comparison of the effect of 5HMF on the position of the oxygen equilibrium curves of human blood samples and those obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats and Beagle dogs that are treated with various doses of 5HMF, by multipoint tonometry, (2) Determination of the single dose acute toxicity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 5HMF in Sprague-Dawley rats and Beagle dogs, following oral/intravenous administration of 5HMF, and (3) Determination of the repeat-dose toxicity and pharmacokinetics of 5HMF in Sprague-Dawley rats and Beagle dogs, following oral/intravenous administration of 5HMF for 14 consecutive days. The toxicological response and tissue distribution will be assessed in proposed animal models. Our long term ultimate goal is to develop a safe and effective antisickling agent as either an oral or IV-delivered therapeutic for SCD. The Phase I SBIR preclinical, in vivo animal efficacy and toxicology studies should clearly identify 5HMF as the new antisickling agent. The goals of phase II SBIR proposal will be to initiate Phase I study of 5HMF to establish the safety, tolerance and efficacy of 5HMF, by the most favored mode of delivery, in healthy human volunteers and sickle cell patients."

Although the Hb S of patients with SCD in the steady state can transport oxygen like normal hemoglobin, Hb S forms rigid fibers when the blood is exposed to hypoxia. The deoxy-Hb S fibers push the red blood cell membrane toward the outside, causing deformation of the cells to assume a sickle shape. Rigid sickled cells cannot pass through narrow capillaries and they occlude blood vessels, which may cause serious organ damage. Although the cause of SCD is well known and more than 200,000 drugs have been screened, hydroxyurea is the only drug that is currently available for the treatment of patients with SCD. One problem with hydroxyurea, however, is that it is not uniformly effective in all patients and some patients develop severe adverse effects.
In an attempt to develop a new anti-sickling agent, Xechem, together with researchers at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, PA, proposes testing of a new phytopharmaceutical anti-sickling agent, NIPRISAN, for the treatment of patients with SCD. NIPRISAN is the extract of four kinds of plants in Africa and has been used in Nigeria for the treatment of SCD for a long time. However, since it was not studied scientifically and the remedies were prepared differently in different areas, the drug has never been used in other countries. Recently, the Nigerian government performed preliminary studies on NIPRISAN and showed that oral administration of NIPRISAN led to a significant reduction in the frequency of painful episodes. The effectiveness of NIPRISAN was also studied at the Sickle Ceil Disease Reference Laboratory at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, PA, using transgenic (tg) sickle mice that produce human HbS.
The aim of this application is to prepare a novel, safe, standardized drug that will be uniformly effective in patients with SCD with minimum adverse effects. For this purpose, in the Phase 1 study, we will prepare a standardized optimal formulation of NIPRISAN that will be easily administered orally, has a consistent anti-sickling effect among different lots, and maintains the maximum activity during the shelf time. The development of an effective anti-sickling agent not only is beneficial to patients with SCD and their families, but also will reduce the financial burden on governments and healthcare systems."

Small detection ranges limit the detectability of the field. As detections occur in the field, detections are transmitted acoustically to a master node.

In order to maximize field life, an approach must be developed to control detector thresholds and acoustic communication routing, as well as the initial placement of the field. To address these problems, ORINCON proposes the development of an adaptive threshold control scheme. This technique will minimize the power consumption while still maintaining the field-level probability of detection. Acoustic communication routing of the field will also be accomplished to minimize power consumption and therefore extend the life of the field. The control law to be developed is based on two approaches, evolutionary programming and integer programming.

In Phase I, Xelera Research LLC worked closely with both BNL and Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) teams to study multiple concepts for the critical merger and arc sections of a high bunch charge ERL. These sections were designed using comprehensive modeling and global numerical optimization to suppress the detrimental effects of coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) and space charge (SC). The Xelera team also began to develop a complete start-to-end design to set the stage for the Phase II project. In Phase II, we will partner with BNL scientists to develop complete ERL designs suitable for production use.

Their lifetime is often limited by the vacuum level within the electron gun, due to surface poisoning or through the process of ion back- bombardment. This process is generated by the ionization of residual gas by the electron beam produced in the gun, and these ions are then accelerated by the gun towards the photocathode causing surface degradation. Any improvement of the vacuum level within the gun reduces the residual gas and thus the rate of degradation. Vacuum barriers applied to the vacuum chamber walls could be a method of trapping gas from the chamber walls and flanges, which is the primary source of gas in the XHV (Extreme High Vacuum) range at which photocathode guns operate. The TiN family of coatings has the potential to be effective vacuum barriers and are widely used in industry for their surface hardness and wear properties. There are a number of other benefits that could be advantageous to high voltage DC photo guns. These coatings can be tailored (for example AlTiN) for a black, non-reflective finish, which acts as a light absorber, collecting any scattered stray light from the laser illumination of the photo cathode. This stray light can lead to unwanted halo formation from the cathode. This family of coatings is also extremely hard, which can lead to improved high voltage breakdown properties. In this Phase I project the vacuum outgassing properties will be the primary focus. Coatings will be applied to large surface area test chambers and compared with identical uncoated chambers. Outgassing rates can be measured by a spinning rotor gauge monitoring and compared with other coatings to isolate potential beneficial coatings.

co-entrapment for vaccine efficacy. The results obtained from this SBIR Phase I project will provide the foundation for further research into active immunotherapy of NHL and other cancer indications using liposomes charged with tumor antigens and cytokine
immunostimulators. Therapeutic cancer vaccines are a promising fourth dimension' to cancer treatment regimens already consisting of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy/mAb therapy. Unlike the current treatments, such vaccines promise to be much less toxic
 and invasive. A therapeutic vaccine for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma will provide a new treatment modality for the 55,000 new cases of the disease diagnosed in the US each year as well as the over 300,000 persons who are currently under long-term treatment or i

This technology will reduce size and complexity of our existing world-class commercial systems for producing hyperpolarized xenon, an inhalable agent for imaging pulmonary function, as well as reducing SWaP for a scalable directed energy weapon. If awarded a Phase II continuation, we will assemble and optimize a 15kW pump laser module, mate it with our proprietary flowing-curtain gas circulator system, and demonstrate a diffraction limited DPAL beam. Although DPAL development programs are underway within the Air Force, our innovation unleashes a cascade of benefits over those efforts, including total absorption of the pump beam at modest gas temperatures, lowered cavity heat load, elimination of chemical cracking of the hydrocarbon quenching-agent, instant time-to-firing (no warm-up transient), and a low-risk power-scaling path to megawatt levels."

One new type of instrument, the wide-angle polarized neutron spectrometer, is severely constrained by the volume of high-quality polarized 3He gas that can reliably be produced. In a prior project, our team developed a prototype large-scale 3He polarizer with potential for addressing this need. By illuminating a large multi-liter glass polarizer cell inside a pressure vessel with a 1.2 kW wavelength-locked laser, we had demonstrated spin-up rates of 20% per hour for 50 STP liters, a world record. During Phase 1 of this project, we designed and had built an industrial-scale titanium vacuum pump. During Phase 2 we assembled a test rig with uniform field, transfer lines, and diagnostics. We demonstrated that this compressor could evacuate polarized 3He from an analyzer into a reservoir while retaining 3He polarization within a few percent. A second goal, the development of commercial-ready software and hardware infrastructure that could operate the system stably over time periods of several days was also achieved. Finally, the third Phase 2 goal, and much of the effort, was directed towards fabricating, filling, and testing 8.5 liter aluminosilicate glass cells for the polarizer. We were successful in flawlessly fabricating and filling three GE180 cells, achieving lifetime over 12 hours and delivering our ultimate polarization of 60%. Calculations show that additional tuning of the laser could have provided as much as 70%. We propose a sequential Phase IIB continuation of this project for new research and development tasks that extend beyond the scope of the original Phase II grant. Firstly, we will investigate new cell preparation techniques, including applying sol-gel coatings on these 8.5 liter cells fabricated from both borosilicate and aluminosilicate glasses to achieve long 40+ hour lifetime and high polarizations of 75% or more. Secondly, we will pursue 85% polarization by implementing a novel architecture external cavity pump laser we recently invented that can produce multi-kilowatt output at line-widths much narrower than any commercially available pump laser, as low as 30pm. Thirdly, we propose to demonstrate our 3He gas circulation and polarizer technology at a US neutron scattering facility as an essential first step of our commercialization strategy. Opportunities for commercializing this technology are outstanding. New large-angle neutron scattering spectrometer installations at laboratories throughout the world are actively seeking turnkey commercial polarized 3He solutions, while spin-off applications include neonatal lung imaging and optical pumping of alkali vapor lasers for missile defense."

The performance of one new type of instrument, the wide-angle polarized neutron spectrometer, is severely constrained by the volume of polarized3 He gas that can be produced and the level of polarization that it can maintain. Currently 3He polarizers produced in Europe based on Metastability Exchange Optical Pumping dominate the international market, with existing installations in Germany and France and two multimillion dollar contracts recently closed for ISIS in England and ANSTO in Australia. Even those systems have limitations in capacity and reliability, leading developers of new wide-angle spectrometers, such as the TOPAS group at Jlich, to seek an alternative with greater capacity, higher polarization, and better reliability. In an ongoing parallel project, our team developed a large-scale 3He polarizer based on Hybrid-alkali Spin Exchange Optical Pumping. By illuminating a large 8.5 liter glass polarizer cell inside a pressure vessel with a 1.2 kW laser we demonstrated spin-up rates of 20% per hour for 50 STP liters, a world record. We recently upgraded that polarizer with a custom-built 2.5 kW spectrally-narrowed laser and a fully integrated support infrastructure. Testing of new monolithic glass cells in this upgraded polarizer is imminent. In Phase 1 of this project, we demonstrated feasibility for utilizing this large-scale 3He polarizer to allow automated filling and emptying of a large analyzer with minimal polarization losses. In particular, we proposed and accomplished four objectives: we designed and had built a non-ferrous vacuum pump capable of evacuating a 40 liter analyzer volume in 15 minutes with minimal polarization loss. We operated the compressor, demonstrating it can transfer helium from 100 torr to 8000 torr, simulating the required evacuation of the analyzer volume back into the polarizer. We developed a sapphire orifice throttle and installed it and the compressor in a rig for testing their polarization preserving properties. We began characterizing polarization losses using an integrated NMR system. These substantial accomplishments within a nine- month Phase 1 project give confidence that the technical challenges of assembling a high- polarization, low-loss, long-running prototype will be accomplished within our Phase 2 plan. Our overall plan seeks routine operation of a 40 liter neutron analyzer with average polarization exceeding 75%, a challenging goal demanded by the science. Since our exotic pump arrived just as Phase I ended, our first aim for Phase II is a thorough study of the existing setup. We will also extend our archival measurements of surface relaxivity to various metal, ceramic, and plastic materials to guide our choices for use in the final pumping system, transfer lines, valves, and orifices. Our second aim is to improve our polarizer. We will develop materials processing techniques that will allow our cells to be blown from GE180, and retrofit our laser with dedicated components that achieve 2.5kW with 0.15nm line width. Our third aim is to incorporate new subsystems and implement process automation that will be essential for routine operation of a large-scale 3He polarizer and wide-angle neutron analyzer. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: We estimate a market size of a dozen large scale 3He polarizer-analyzer systems for fundamental and applied physics research over the next decade, with synergistic benefits in pediatric lung imaging."

Examples of these evidence-based recommendations include not performing synergy testing to combat multi-drug-resistant infections, and using only one daily dose of aminoglycoside antibiotics, which was found equally effective as three. However for six of ten therapies evaluated, there simply was not enough data to make recommendations. These six included inpatient versus outpatient care; simultaneous use of intravenous and inhaled antibiotics; number of antibiotics used to treat pseudomonas aeruginosa; continuous infusion of betalactam antibiotics; and duration of antibiotic treatment. This situation clearly indicates that new tools are needed for evaluating response to therapy in CF, particularly for those involving antibiotics and the treatment of CF exacerbations. Hyperpolarized-gas MRI has been shown to be effective for assessingregional airflow impairment of cystic fibrosis in pediatric and adult patients. To date all hyperpolarized-gas MRI studies in children have employed hyperpolarized helium-3 due to wider access to the required infrastructure. Hyperpolarized xenon-129 (HXe)has been perceived as less appropriate for children due to its solubility in blood and tissues, and concomitant side effects including brief euphoria, dysphoria, and/or numbness. However, state-of-the-art polarization infrastructure is providing HXe polarizations as high as 50%, allowing clinical imaging with modest doses. Furthermore from a diagnostic perspective, the solubility of xenon in tissue and blood is precisely the property that makes it able to interrogate lung tissue inflammation, which may serve as an important biomarker for antibiotic response in cystic fibrosis exacerbations. Our collaboration recently demonstrated simultaneous acquisition of xenon gas-phase and xenon dissolved-phase images in a single breath hold. In one of our  healthy  volunteers, we discovered a previously undiagnosed inflammatory nodule was highly conspicuous on the dissolved phase images. This result suggests that this technique may be sensitive to inflammation. Since inflammation is a primary treatment target in CF, this technique may be well suited to detect response to treatment in patients with CF. We propose to utilize HXe simultaneous gas- and dissolved-phase MRI together with a new dual-nucleus structure-function ventilation imaging protocol, acquiring both proton and HXe images within a single breath hold, to monitor therapeutic response in cystic fibrosis exacerbations. Five patients admitted for a cystic fibrosis exacerbation will be recruited, including at least two children. Patients will be imaged upon initiation of treatment and three weeks after therapy commences. Data will be incorporated into an imaging biomarker for CF and compared with other metrics such as spirometry and patient self-assessments.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New treatments are in Phase 3 clinical trials that target the underlying abnormality in cystic fibrosis (CF) and restore the function of the cell membrane chloride channel that is abnormal in CF. Because these treatments work differently for different CF genotypes, there is a pressing need to develop a technique for the assessment of treatment efficacy, particularly for young children, so that effective treatment can be initiated before lung damage is irreversible. Hyperpolarized xenon (HXe) MRI is a new modality for imaging lungfunction that does not rely on ionizing radiation, an improvement in safety that is particularly important for children. The proposed study is a vital step toward determining whether HXe MRI could be a useful outcome measure in CF, something that could have tremendous clinical impact in this patient population."

Thus clinicians have only parental reports of patient symptoms upon which to base treatment decisions. Further, clinical trials of treatments for lung disease are difficult to perform in the absence of a quantitative outcome. Therefore many treatments for lung disease have not been tested in young children. Hyperpolarized (HP) noble gas magnetic resonance imaging is a technique for imaging the lung functional microstructure that provides a quantitative evaluation of lung disease severity in three-dimensions with high resolution. Ventilation imaging depicts regional patency of the airway tree, even down to the smallest airways. Ventilation abnormalities reveal the earliest signs of obstructive disease, such as cystic fibrosis and asthma. Diffusion weighted imaging quantifies the Brownian-motion length-scale of gas atoms. By mapping out acinar dimension regionally, diffusion weighted imaging is exquisitely sensitive to underdeveloped or injured alveolar tissues. Since hyperpolarized gas MRI does not use ionizing radiation, it is well-suited for use in children and infants. What is needed are safe and effective devices and methods for administering and imaging hyperpolarized noble gas in neonates and infants. We propose to develop a simple and elegant method for administering hyperpolarized helium-3 (HHe) to neonates and infants. New MR-compatible gas flow technologies will be developed, compared, and incorporated into a novel pass-though junction box which can substitute a small bolus of HHe for an equal amount of air.Its mostly passive and intrinsically safe design features will allow its use with either fre- breathing infants or with neonates on a mechanical ventilator. We will test the device by imaging free-breathing healthy adults while they are simulating the breathing volumes and patterns of infants. We further propose to adapt our 32-element chest coil which we successfully employed for accelerated structure-function imaging in adults. First we down-size it for subjects 13kg and under, and in year 2 optimize a second chest coil design for neonates under 4.5kg. We will submit IRB filings for these devices as non-significant medical risk devices. Working with our academic collaborators, we will first acquire accelerated hyperpolarized helium-3 images in free-breathing 1-2 year old infants, five who are healthy normals and two with chronic lung disease of prematurity (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, BPD). We will compare accelerated spiral and Cartesian imaging protocols exploiting the parallel coil. After regulatory review, we will proceed to imaging two neonates on ventilators just before they are extubated. One subject will be a neonate born prematurely who has early BPD. The second subject will be a neonate under care due to an hypoxic ischemic event. This subject's lungs should be structurally normal. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Due to improvements in perinatal and antenatal care, as many as 50,000 very low birth weight infants are surviving in the US annually, many suffering from chronic lung disease of prematurity or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Optimal management of pulmonary disease in neonates is hindered by the lack of a diagnostic imaging modality that could 1) guide acute care of infants born prematurely, and 2) evaluate outcomes to retrospectively determine which therapies preserve the greatest degree of lung function. Hyperpolarized noble gas MRI, a new safe non-ionizing method for assessing lung function is ideally suited to quantitative lung function measurements in infants. We propose development of a device for administering hyperpolarized noble gases to infants, sensing coils and protocols for MR imaging, and a step-by-step safety review strategy that will demonstrate feasibility by assessing lung function in the neonatal intensive care unit."

Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) applies radiofrequency heating to airway smooth muscle reducing its thickness and hyper-reactivity. This novel minimally invasive intervention is applied to all airways 3mm and larger over the course of threeprocedures. We hypothesize that hyperpolarized xenon (HXe) MRI could identify a subset of dysfunctional airways that dominate the patient's symptoms, and that an image-guided single-session procedure could eliminate overtreatment of non-involved airways, minimize risk and lost productivity, reduce costs of managing this patient group, and convince more payers to reimburse. We propose a double-blind pilot study of thirty patients with severe asthma electing to undergo BT. All patients will participate in three HXe MRI pulmonary functional imaging evaluations of their ventilation defects: at baseline, after their first BT treatment and recovery, and after their final BT treatmet and recovery. Existing and new software methods will identify and rank problematic segmental airways by linking them with the observed ventilation defects. While all patients will receive the full course of BT treatment, half of them will receive a guided BT treatment targeting the most problematic airways in their first treatment session while the control group will receive treatment following the standard sequence. With thirty subjects, this pilot study is adequately powered to detect a change in Quality of Life (QoL) from baseline after one image-guided BT treatment, if changes aresimilar to published BT trials. We seek, however, greater understanding of biopredictors of BT response from our data. We hypothesize that HXe MRI will provide a metric for grading asthma severity more quantitative than QoL for evaluating BT. An importantaim of this study is to evaluate this HXe MRI biomarker for asthma disease severity that includes a set of four images that determine average airway obstruction, bronchodilator reactivity, and variation of these metrics with time. With the HXe MRI metricas our primary endpoint and several asthma QoL indices as secondary end-points, we compare the single session image-guided BT treatment to the standard three-session BT treatment after unblinding the study. Two comparisons are performed: the target groupafter the single-session guided BT treatment will be compared with the control group after the full three sessions; and will be compared with their own improvement after three sessions, serving as their own controls. If data support the most favorable outcome, that HXe MRI guided BT treatment can reduce overtreatment by two-thirds, cut BT costs in half, and achieve an equivalent benefit, then one million Americans could elect image-guided BT to improve their management of severe asthma. Finally, as a clinically-indicated companion diagnostic for an image-guided therapy, HXe would become an FDA-approved and commercially available diagnostic agent within a few years. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bronchial thermoplasty (BT), a newly approved minimally invasive therapy for severe asthmatics, applies radiofrequency heating to all airways 3mm and larger, reducing the thickness and hyper-reactivity of airway smooth muscle.

Hyperpolarized xenon-129 (HXe) MRI, a noninvasive method to assess regional lung structure and function, may prove critical in the guidance of these regional treatments. In our prior work we developed an innovative approach to xenon polarization that provides the liter quantities of highly polarized xenon-129 as required for medical imaging. Our prototype system was deployed at UVa where we performed 600 experiments in 64 patient and healthy volunteers and made significant advances in MR acquisition strategies and image quality. These promising results enable us to move to the next step in the commercialization of HXe, the performance of a Phase 2 clinical trial. Our goals for Phase 2 are to collect safety endpoints in patients with obstructive lung diseases, finalize the HXe dosing and MRI methods, and validate the HXe results by comparing with the existing clinical methods for assessing lung function and microstructure. We selected the two most mature and promising HXe techniques for inclusion in the Phase 2 trial: ventilation and diffusion imaging. Obstructive lung diseases such as COPD and asthma have been shown to have regional abnormalities of ventilation and these abnormalities are prime targets for intervention. Thus our first aim is to validate HXe MRI for the intended use of delineating ventilated and unventilated regions of the lung in COPD and asthma patients. For our Phase 2a trial we will compare HXe ventilation MRI and 99Tc DTPA ventilation scintigraphy (a clinical standard for assessing regional lung ventilation) in 10 healthy volunteers and 70 patients with COPD and asthma. In addition tothe patient safety data, we will assess total lung volume and ventilated lung volume on MRI, and the congruence of ventilated volume boundaries between HXe MRI and scintigraphy. Recently completed pilot studies show that hyperpolarized helium diffusion imaging with six b-values can separately determine diffusion coefficients along and transverse to acinar ducts, which are related to alveolar depth and duct diameter. Our second aim is to validate HXe diffusion MR for the intended use of quantifying alveolar enlargement in emphysema, a fundamental abnormality that currently is assessed only by histology. For our Phase 2b trial we will perform diffusion HXe MRI in vivo in 18 COPD patients scheduled for lung transplant, and repeat the scan in the ex vivo lungafter it is removed, thereby establishing that in vivo and ex vivo HXe measurements are concordant. The final step in the validation of the HXe diffusion measurement is to regionally compare alveolar size with morphometric measurements via histology from the explanted lung. The final portion of the proposed work is to raise quality to Phase 3 level, design a draft Phase 3 trial, meet with the FDA for a pre-Phase 3 meeting, and incorporate the FDA input into the Phase 3 protocol. The completion of the proposed work represents a significant advancement towards commercialization of HXe.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of treatments that cure lung diseases has been slowed by the lack of a method for obtaining regional and quantitative informationabout lung function, especially in obstructive disease. Hyperpolarized xenon MRI is a safe and cost-effective imaging modality that has the potential to meet this need. Once hyperpolarized xenon becomes FDA approved and commercially available, this new MRI contrast agent will improve care and reduce costs in two ways: (1) regional maps of lung function acquired using HXe MRI will guide newly emerging bronchoscopic interventions, and (2) utilization of HXe MRI in drug and medical device clinical trials willimprove their statistics and reduce their time-to- market. We propose two prospective controlled FDA Phase 2 clinical trials that will provide data on safety and efficacy endpoints for these intended uses."

As these instruments have increased in size, they have outstripped 3He polarization capacity, shortening the run times and adversely affecting. A very high productivity source of polarized 3He and a method for flushing these instruments is needed for the next generation of neutron analyzers. We propose to develop an analyzer system that mates our large volume, low cost 3He polarizer to a large volume analyzer, so that the instrument may be frequently refilled and therefore be kept online. This proposal is to develop the gas handling technology to accomplish this. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The direct benefit of this project is to enable new experiments and increase data rates in the neutron scattering experiments. Since neutron scattering is widely used in materials science research, increasing the analyzer availability would increase the availability for the beam for commercial research. There is a small but important market for this technology at nuclear physics laboratories around the world for applications in addition to neutron scattering. Also the gas handling technology proposed here may be important in the growing field of hyperpolarized gas MRI for medical imaging."

New physics experiments to map Generalized Parton Distributions, presently under discussion, will only become feasible with this technology. We recently demonstrated a large-scale polarizer of 3He that offers polarization rates much higher than any worldwide. We will mate this polarizer with a diaphragm pump compressor with all wetted parts fabricated from non-ferrous metals, which will preserve 3He polarization and deliver polarized 3He at 50 liters per minute at 1000 psi and more. Gas returning to the polarizer will drop its pressure through a de Laval nozzle. Luminosity with a 100A electron beam in a 40cm long cell will be 1038. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The $330M allocation for the Jefferson Laboratory 12 GeV upgrade will allow the US to remain the leader in studying electromagnetic interactions in nuclear physics by accessing new kinematic regimes, increasing data rates, and reducing measurement uncertainties.

The availability of a safe, affordable, and highly quantitative modality for 3-D imaging of lung function would improve early diagnosis and discrimination of diseases, accelerate testing of therapies by pharmaceutical companies, and assist in personalized disease management and intervention decisions for children and adult patients. Hyperpolarized xenon (HXe) MRI is a leading candidate to address this need. Since the depolarization of HXe atoms in lungs is dominated by the presence of paramagnetic oxygen gas molecules, an imaging sequence that determines the rate of signal loss can be interpreted as a map of the local alveolar oxygen concentration. Our recent hundred-fold improvements in HXe production technology deliver high polarizations of HXe in multi-liter quantities. We have incorporated this technology into a compact platform, delivered it to clinical partners, and operated it remotely over periods of several months. Our xenon-tuned 32-element parallel receive coil with integrated asymmetric birdcage transmit coil achieves highly uniform flip angles with maximal speed-up factors, allowing several 3D images in a single breath hold. Our Phase I project demonstrated feasibility for a robust, quantitative, high resolution protocol by implementing and performing pulse sequences that determine the rate of signal loss of pulmonary HXe, applying novel image registration techniques, and estimating corrections due to loss of HXe into the bloodstream. In this Phase 2 project we propose to establish HXe mapping of local alveolar oxygen as a clinically validated and commercially viable diagnostic protocol. We will implement imaging sequences that reconstruct oxygen-induced signal loss with three state-of-the-art acceleration schemes to compare their resolution, SNR, susceptibility to artifacts, and biomarker accuracy. We will compare these sequences against three truth standards: precisely mixed bags of gas, healthy volunteers performing tidal breathing with their exhaled gases calibrated with gas concentration analysis, and hyperventilated healthy volunteers with exhaled gases calibrated with gas concentration analysis. Comparing measurements after tidal breathing to others after hyperventilating will allow calibration and improvement of our models correcting for lt 10% xenon signal lost to the bloodstream. Finally we will explore and demonstrate the utility of this protocol in the diagnosis and severity staging of several patients with COPD (ventilation abnormalities), interstitial disease (gas exchange abnormalities), and sickle cell disease (perfusion abnormalities). The US FDA has approved our hyperpolarized xenon for Phase 2 trials in subjects with lung disease.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary functional magnetic resonance imaging with hyperpolarized xenon, a technology which recently improved by two orders of magnitude, has the potential to address unmet needs in managing a full range of lung diseases, including COPD, asthma, cystic fibrosis, and interstitial diseases. We propose to develop an innovative, robust, and quantitative probe of regional alveolar oxygen concentration with high resolution in three-dimensions and validate it against truth standards. This non-ionizing, well-tolerated, quick, and affordable imaging modality would provide pulmonologists caring for children through adult patients with maps of the highest measure of lung function: regional oxygen exchange into the bloodstream."

Polarized 3He cells serve as neutron spin filters for preparation of intense beams of polarized neutrons, and as spin analyzers for determining polarization of scattered neutrons. While super-mirrors offer an alternative, cells of polarized 3He are favored in many experiments for their compact size, effectiveness over a broad range of neutron energies, and ability to conveniently have their spin reversed to cancel uncertainties. Existing 3He polarization systems based on alkali Spin Exchange Optical Pumping (SEOP) use lasers to illuminate cells in-situ, cells placed in beam lines or adjacent to scattering targets. These systems suffer from compromises. The NPDGamma experiment recently found that the neutron beam has an immediate depolarizing effect on the alkali vapor, and a long-term aging effect leading to milky buildup on the cell walls. Analyzers of unusual geometries are difficult to illuminate. Ex-situ polarization, separated operation of the polarizer with polarized gas delivery to the cells, has been exploited successfully in Europe. Metastability Exchange Optical Pumping (MEOP) used for that system, however, requires a large volume for polarization and specialized compression equipment, at high cost. Xemed and the University of New Hampshire have partially completed a prototype large-scale 3He SEOP polarizer funded by the NIH for cost-effective medical diagnostic imaging. We propose to adapt our 3He polarization technology for use as an ex-situ system for neutron spin filters and analyzers. Our system, appropriately adapted, would be located by the side of the neutron beam line and utilize multi-kilowatt lasers to produce up to 30 liters per day of 3He polarized as high as 75% or more. In Phase I we propose to fully investigate the high polarization capabilities of the system, primarily through implementing our flowing oil thermal stabilization system, reconfiguring our multi-kilowatt laser for few-milliradian divergence, fabricating three aluminosilicate cells, and testing them for long lifetime and low X-factor.

For childhood lung disease, the case bec
omes even more compelling because the primary imaging modalities for the lung expose the child to ionizing radiation, and children are more radiation sensitive than adults. Thus, hyperpolarized gas MRI might be particularly suitable to assess asthma, cysti
c fibrosis (CF), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or pulmonary pathology in sickle cell patients in children. To this extent we propose to advance the methodology of Xenon polarization Transfer Contrast (XTC) MRI and the distribution capabilities of the re
quired hyperpolarized xenon-129 (HXe129). XTC MRI in its current implementation can only characterize the gas exchange process between the lung tissue and the alveolar air spaces in general. However, we hypothesize that additional refinements and the use o
f magnetic field strengths up to 3 T will permit new spectral selectivity, distinguishing for the first time in humans exchange between the airspaces and parenchyma from exchange between the airspaces and red blood cells. Such an improvement would allow co
nsiderably higher sensitivity for pathological changes and better disease phenotyping. These efforts will be accomplished by temporarily relocating Xemed's portable clinical polarizer prototype to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. This demonstration
 of a cost-effective approach to meeting the scientific infrastructure requirements for hyperpolarized xenon MRI will lower the cost barrier to many research groups seeking to access a world-class xenon polarizer.Xenon polarization Transfer Contrast (XTC)
MRI has been shown to be a promising tool to measure lung function through the detection of the ongoing gas- exchange processes between lung parenchyma and alveolar air spaces. In this proposal we suggest to extend the technique to monitor gas exchange bet

 performance of a series of extremely targeted, non-invasive lung function tests, without employing ionizing radiation or radioactive tracers, that could be conducted within 5-6 6s breath holds. Since such maneuvers can usually be performed even by patient
s with severe lung disease or young children the resulting product would be of tremendous interest to the pharmaceutical industry for the development of novel drugs for pulmonary diseases and the monitoring of treatment over extended periods of time."

Full characteri
zation of pulmonary health may benefit from as many as eight different multi-liter protocols, which should ideally be completed in well under an hour. Three years ago our group identified an efficient method for polarization and developed an apparatus to e
xploit the high flow, low pressure polarization regime, increasing output by more than a factor of ten to 1 L/hr at 50%. In our Phase 1 proposal we argued that assembling a polarizer with several heat-conducting channels operating in parallel would permit
a scale up by a factor of the number of channels, assuming similar conditions of temperature, pressure, laser illumination, and cell geometry. Furthermore, if the laser spectrum could be narrowed, then dropping the pressure by a factor of two could yield a
nother two-fold improvement in production rate. During Phase 1 we developed new fabrication techniques, assembled a copper prototype, adapted our existing laser and magnetic infrastructure for its installation, and characterized its performance. We confirm
ed predictions, that the multi-channel polarizer column delivers HXe with gt50% polarization at a rate of two liters per hour per hundred watts of narrowed laser power, up to 250 watts, a six-fold improvement over our previous world's best production rate.
 We discovered that birefringence arising from thermal stresses in a few laser elements was compromising polarization demonstrations of our copper-column technology up to the full kilowatt of available laser power, a problem that can now be easily correcte
d. In Phase 2 we propose full characterization of our new prototype polarizer, demonstrating twenty- fold scale up of xenon polarizer production output. We will characterize its performance over wide ranges of gas mixture, pressure, temperature, flow rates
, and laser power. We will probe the low pressure limit, including a more complete characterization of the nitrogen partial pressure required for quenching. We will develop technology to monitor remaining rubidium and to sequester condensed rubidium, exten

timately assist in more personalized disease management and intervention in clinics and hospitals. Hyperpolarized gases can address this need. 3He has enjoyed the most widespread study largely due to the availability of mature polarization technologies. Re
cently high polarization of 129Xe in liter quantities has become available due to innovations by the UNH group, allowing the potential scientific advantages of hyperpolarized 129Xe imaging to be investigated. Depolarization of hyperpolarized atoms, both 3H
e and 129Xe, in lungs is dominated by the presence of paramagnetic oxygen gas molecules. T1 decay constant protocols using hyperpolarized 3He have mapped local oxygen partial pressures and furthermore show sensitivity to oxygen uptake by the bloodstream wi
thin a breath hold. Hyperpolarized 129Xe has the same sensitivity to oxygen and much lower diffusion, in addition to practical advantages of low cost and abundant supply. We propose to demonstrate that 129Xe can compete successfully with 3He by performing
the following measurements:1. We will perform signal loss contrast imaging with mixtures of hyperpolarized 129Xe and oxygen in phantoms. 2. We will perform signal loss contrast imaging using hyperpolarized 129Xe and oxygen in human subjects. 3. We will com
pare signal loss during a breath hold with other hyperpolarized xenon metrics of lung health to quantify uncertainties. Back to back measurements with published and new pulse sequences will reveal comparative merits of each. Multiple measurements in the sa
me subject, both during the same imaging session and after repositioning will provide a measure of the systematic errors, including those resulting from partial volume effects in voxels. We will explore reducing partial volume effects using proton imaging.
 Comparing measurements after breath holding with others after hyperventilating will allow separation of xenon lost to the bloodstream and signal lost due to O2. The US FDA has approved our hyperpolarized xenon for Phase 2 trials in subjects with mild to m
oderate lung disease.While both 129Xe and 3He can be used to measure local alveolar oxygen concentration and determine the uptake of oxygen by the lungs, each poses challenges to quantitative interpretation. We propose to push the quantitative limits to ex
tracting lung functional health from 129Xe measurements using a variety of methods, in order to develop a diagnostic protocol suite that could help Americans suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Of the two gases being investigated f

 spins to modify the polarization of the gas phase, XTC offers unparalleled sensitivity to local gas exchange surface area. Furthermore, since 129Xe is abundant in nature only xenon offers a commercially viable strategy for widespread clinical imaging of l
ung microstructure. Xemed has secured FDA approval for human subject testing, completed Phase 1 trials and advanced to Phase 2, and is committed to completing the regulatory process and securing New Drug status for its signature imaging agent MagniXene . I
n this Phase 2 proposal we will extend our ADC and XTC protocols in quantitative precision, application versatility, and diagnostic relevance. Our investigation of two protocol refinements added to the two we already implemented in Phase 1 will assure high
 reproducibility and internal crosschecks. All protocols will be optimized for the present 2D projections and 1D histograms, as well as for new 2D slices and 3D renderings. ADC studies will be extended to include stimulated echo studies, which may provide
sensitivity to changes in collateral ventilation, enhancing diagnosis of early emphysema. XTC studies will be extended to compare short and long gas exchange times, with sensitivity to septal wall thickening and blood flow. Voxel-by-voxel reproducibility s
tudies will be performed. Parameters will be optimized on healthy volunteers and patients with mild to moderate lung disease. This study, the first component of our Phase 2 FDA trial program, will standardize biomarkers for emphysema, leading to a large-sc
ale Phase 2 FDA clinical trial of MagniXene as a safe, effective, and commercially viable imaging agent for pulmonary disease."

Production of high quality hyperpolarized xenon has proven challenging. Three years ago our group at the University of New Hampshire identified an efficient method for polarization and developed an apparatus to exploit this regime, advancing the productivity of polarizers by more than one order of magnitude. Since that time, our efforts to further increase output by increasing laser power have not met with success. We have determined that laser heating of the gas leads to lower efficiency of the polarizer. We have invented a new apparatus that could essentially eliminate this barrier, allowing further scaling up of the polarized xenon output of our polarizer. We propose to implement this new invention and demonstrate an increase in polarization output of a factor of twenty over our existing polarizer. A polarizer with this output, roughly one liter per minute, will be able to meet the research and clinical requirements of real-time pulmonary functional imaging protocols. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. Hyperpolarized xenon MRI offers a highly quantitative and practical method for measuring functional parameters of lungs and tracking them over time, which would be a benefit for these patients, not only as a personal diagnostic agent, but also as a tool in the search for safe and effective inhaled therapeutic pharmaceuticals. In this proposal, the leading hyperpolarized xenon research group proposes to implement new technology that can scale up the output of our polarizer by another factor of twenty or more, achieving the goal of liter-per-minute production."

Pharmaceutical companies require sensitive diagnostic end points to determine the efficacy of COPD therapies they have under development and accelerate their progress through FDA approval and into the marketplace. Individual sufferers of COPD could benefit from improved diagnosis and treatment. The US healthcare budget could benefit if the $35B spent on the 30 million Americans suffering from COPD could be directed towards effective treatments through accurate assessments. The primary obstacle to progress has been the availability of high quality hyperpolarization technology and services for both technical and legal reasons. We see a clear path to overcoming those obstacles. We propose to assemble a world-leading 3He polarizer using the low-cost spin-exchange optical pumping technique. New optical pumping technologies, many developed by us only recently and others to be developed in this proposal, will allow production of 55% polarization at 100 bar-liters per day and as high as 70% polarization at one-third that rate. This phase of the project includes submission of the product gas as an Investigational New Drug (IND) to the US FDA. A subsequent phase will include refinement and duplication of the prototype, utilization of the prototype to partner with clinical and pharmaceutical research centers for human trials, and submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA.

There is currently no clear diagnostic methodology by which early detection of tissue loss can be assessed. We propose to develop a new metric that can quantitatively measure lung tissue microstructure in smokers. This study could be useful for observing the onset of early emphysema and validating the safety and efficacy of emphysema interventions. Hyperpolarized xenon (HyXe) MRI was recently demonstrated by our collaborative partnership to provide exquisitely sensitive measurements of regional alveolar lung surface area on the few micron scale. By using the xenon chemical shift to distinguish xenon dissolved in tissue from xenon in the gaseous phase, we observed the temporal increase in phase exchange to depend on the square root of the exchange time. The ratio of the dissolved signal to the gas signal is proportional to the parenchyma partition coefficient and the average surface-to-volume ratio. The time to saturation reveals the parenchyma thickness (squared) scaled by the tissue diffusion constant. We propose measurements of lung surface area in smokers correlated with pack-years. In Phase 1 we will measure 20 subjects with smoking histories greater than 20 pack-years and 10 age and gender matched healthy adults. Data will be analyzed to determine average lung surface area correlates in males and females. In Phase 2 we will expand the study statistics to include more smokers, and remeasure the original subjects to determine tissue loss with time in a longitudinal study."

Hyperpolarized xenon offers advantages of a low diffusion constant and availability from natural sources. It also has applications in dissolved state imaging, with a high solubility in fluids and tissues and a characteristic chemical shift, revealing its microscopic environment. Comparison of the dissolved and gaseous signals in lungs, for example, offers a precise measure of surface-to-volume ratio. A protocol involving a suite of lung images in three-dimensions or a program to investigate dissolved- phase imaging of perfused organs in humans could beneficially utilize large quantities of highly polarized xenon. The UNH group has developed a new type of xenon polarizer that flows the gas mixture at relatively high velocity and low pressure along a direction opposite to the laser beam, producing polarization of over 60% for small quantities and 22% for a production rate of six liters per hour. The figure-of-merit (polarization times production rate) of this polarizer presently exceeds all other polarizer technologies by an order of magnitude. The 500 torr operating pressure represents a compromise between higher laser absorption (at higher pressure) and faster spin-exchange rates (at lower pressure). Our numerical simulations indicate that magnetization output scales with absorbed laser power, that is, power within a narrow range around the spectral absorption band. Using STTR Phase I funding we have further developed our high-power spectrally narrowed laser technology for spin-exchange optical pumping of hyperpolarized gas. We scaled up our spectrally narrowed laser technology to 480W. Separately, we adapted our 5 bar 130 watt and 9 bar 270 watt lasers to investigate two new technologies to reduce the mode structure of the output beam for better collimation. We recently installed our 270 watt laser on the polarizer, and we expect polarization figures for both lasers once calibrations are set. For Phase II we will complete our study of the mode reduction technology to achieve a narrow spectral output with nearly ideal collimation. We will measure laser output as a function of mode and spectral constraints. We will investigate polarizer output as a function of laser power. We will test two different polarizer column diameters and two different polarizer column lengths to optimize the physical properties of the polarizer for increased output. We expect to come close to the goal of real-time hyperpolarized xenon production, 60 L/hr at ~50% polarization. This research to develop a high power laser will increase the production rate for producing hyperpolarized xenon. Hyperpolarized Xenon Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was recently demonstrated as an exquisitely sensitive method for assessment of lung ventilation and tissue health, with applications to quantifying obstructive lung disease and emphysema. The specific aim of the current work is to increase the production rate of hyperpolarized xenon to greater than 60 L/hr, allowing an imaging subject to breathe the gas directly from the polarizer in real time. High-volume, cost-effective production of hyperpolarized xenon will also provide a new background-free, non-recirculating contrast agent for blood and tissues which may offer unique contrast for diagnosing a broad spectrum of diseases."

Emphysema is characterized by a sudden irreversible decay of lung tissue, reducing the surface area for gas exchange while increasing the alveolar void dimensions. MRI diffusion-weighted sequences with hyperpolarized gases measure diffusion distance versus time, probing the void spatial dimensions. Although 3He diffusion MRI exposes emphysema's ravaging effects in mid and late stages, the fast diffusion of 3He (atoms travel normal alveolar diameters in less than a millisecond) interferes with early diagnosis and quantitative tracking of the disease. The lower diffusion constant of xenon offers sensitivity to restrictions to diffusion that are a factor of 3.7 smaller (along one dimension) than those probed with 3He, allowing detection of early emphysema when alveolar volumes are a factor of fifty smaller. Furthermore, the solubility of xenon in lung surface tissues offers a second, complementary measure of lung microstructure. Unlike 3He which is expensive, not found in nature, and only occurs as a byproduct of weapons development, xenon is cheap and abundant and therefore commercially viable. The primary obstacle to exploiting these advantages, low polarization using routine production techniques, has now been overcome. The new conter-flowing polarizer developed at UNH and Xemed offers a factor often higher magnetization output than the best competing designs. We will demonstrate that hyperpolarized xenon-129 MRI exceeds the sensitivity of 3He to early emphysema by performing the following measurements in healthy human subjects: 1. We will determine alveolar dimensions by measuring average diffusion distance as a function of time 2. We will measure local alveolar surface-to-volume ratio using xenon polarization transfer between the gas space (volume) and the xenon dissolved in the lung tissue (surface).

Since its first demonstration as an imaging agent in MRI nearly a decade ago, the promise of hyperpolarized xenon has captured the attention of the research community. It can be introduced into a subject non-invasively by breathing, and has a well-understood short-term biological effect. Relative to hyperpolarized helium, its advantages include its natural abundance and low cost. Both hyperpolarized xenon and helium have demonstrated utility in lung imaging, and quantifying lung disease. In contrast to helium, however, hyperpolarized xenon has a high solubility in fluids and tissues and a characteristic chemical shift, revealing its microscopic environment in dissolved-phase imaging. Consequently, the time dependence of its transport and absorption offer prospects for functional imaging of perfusion.

Since its first demonstration as an imaging agent in MRI nearly a decade ago, the promise of hyperpolarized xenon has captured the attention of the research community. It can be introduced into a subject non-invasively by breathing, and has a well-understood short-term biological effect. Relative to hyperpolarized helium, its advantages include its natural abundance and low cost. Both hyperpolarized xenon and helium have demonstrated utility in lung imaging, and quantifying lung disease. In contrast to helium, however, hyperpolarized xenon has a high solubility in fluids and tissues and a characteristic chemical shift, revealing its microscopic environment in dissolved-phase imaging. Consequently, the time dependence of its transport and absorption offer prospects for functional imaging of perfusion. Using NIH R21 and R15 funds, the UNH group demonstrated a new type of xenon polarizer that flows the gas mixture at relatively high velocity and low pressure along a direction opposite to the laser beam. This polarizer demonstrated polarization of almost 50% for a production rate of one liter per hour.

In the game, students design, assemble and train virtual walking robots to compete against their peer robots to secure a seat on a virtual mission to Mars. The project analyses the effects of competition and collaboration on the learning and retention of key robotic control concepts. The project will produce a low-cost educational computer game, where far more U.S. middle schools and high schools students can learn about biomechanics, math, physics and computer algorithms through a robotic simulation game than is possible with current robot hardware approaches. The product provides the American educational system a solution to quickly engage students in STEM who might otherwise turn away. STEM field professions can lead to high paying jobs, which in turn can improve productivity and the economic landscape for America. The project's education technology innovation is a cloud-based robot evolution game engine where students acting as a crowd can evolve the behavior of walking bi-pedal robots. The evolution of robot behavior happens on three levels: 1) the micro scale where an individual or small group of students evolves singular robot behaviors, 2) the mid-scale where groups exchange individual behaviors to form a behavior sequence to meet game level challenges. (For example, link a sequence of behaviors to stand, walk, jump, and turn to clear a section of obstacles and reach the prize goal), 3) the macro scale where the community evolves a cumulative set of behaviors through re-use and adoption of most efficient behaviors, discarding failed behaviors and creating new game level challenges. In particular, this project studies how individual and group learning is affected by adjusting the reward incentive, competitive motivation, novelty and surprise, and challenge level difficulty. During competition, the game gathers data regarding level of student learning and robot performance to answer two specific questions: a) do students learn more through small group or large group collaboration/competition, and b) are the students more engaged in small or large scale crowd-sourced environments."

According to the National Center for Education Statistics there are 47 million students enrolled in K-12, with 29 million in middle or high school (6-12). Inspiring and engaging these students in STEM is a key component of the President?s ?Educate to Innovate Initiative?. This project will produce a low-cost computer game designed to heighten interest in STEM-related careers among these students by engaging them in game play and interactive design of robotic controllers and robot body-parts while they apply principles of mathematics, biomechanics, neuroscience and computer science. With distribution through direct internet download and through major app stores, this product taps into the commercial gaming industry with revenues of over $14B annually according to the NDP Group. Partnering with local high schools and university researchers, the project will advance our understanding of how to balance the challenge of gaming with the rewards of learning. This SBIR project proposes to deliver a software game product for Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) education in the area of evolutionary robotics. The project will explore the use of Interactive Evolutionary Algorithms (IEAs) to evolve the behavior of simulated robots. In collaboration with experts in evolutionary robotics and evolutionary algorithms, the project team will measure the effectiveness of using IEAs as compared to non-interactive simple genetic algorithms and direct controller programming. With an IEA the user influences the direction of evolution through user demonstration. This method can significantly reduce evolutionary time through the search space and provides a more hands-on approach to evolutionary robotics, continually engaging the student user during the design and simulation process. The project will also investigate the use of scaffolding to physically support the robot during the evolutionary process. The physical supports are removed over evolutionary time, gradually increasing the difficulty of the task as the robot evolves, until the robot can walk or run unassisted."

There are currently no consistent biological markers for Autism, and diagnosis is currently based upon analysis of behavioral traits and developmental history. The most beneficial treatment for ASD is behavioral therapy, which is most effective if administered early in life. We have previously identified and validated a set of protein biomarkers for autism risk in the plasma of women from a large cohort of mothers of children with autism and unaffected controls. The main goal of the proposed research is to develop a multiplex quantitative assay for these biomarkersto be able to predict the risk of having a child with autism, prior to pregnancy, especially in those mothers who have at least one child with autism and are at elevated risk of having a second child on the spectrum. This test can also be used post-natally to determine if a child is at risk based on the maternal autoantibody profile. To achieve this goal we propose the following three Specific Aims: Aim #1: Express LDH-A, LDH-B, Cypin, STIP1, CRMP1, and CRIMP2 proteins in both a mammalian and prokaryotic expression systems. To evaluate the immunoreactivity of the endogenous autoantibodies from mothers of children with autism and typically developing controls against these expressed proteins. Aim #2: Develop high throughput multiplexed assays for LDH, Cypin,STIP1 and CRMP1. Produce standard curve of autoantibody concentration vs. signal in buffer and plasma and evaluate assay accuracy, precision, and sensitivity. Aim #3: Validation studies with blinded serum sets using the newly developed multiplex assays will be used to correlate the concentration of each of these endogenous autoantibodies to the development of disease in samples taken from mothers during pregnancy that gave birth to a child with autism vs. mothers that give birth to typically developing child, and establish a threshold for a positive prognosis with 99% confidence. The project will result in a diagnostic product that will give women an opportunity to know if they are at risk of having a child with autism prior to conception, thereby allowingthe possibility to take preventative steps and early intervention.

One method for increasing solubility is the introduction of appropriate mutations. A general, robust, and efficient method for identifying mutations that will confer solubility to a protein of interest would have tremendous commercial value. This proposal seeks to employ an innovative technology, Protein Design Automation(r) (PDATM), to improve the solubility of an important protein therapeutic, interferon beta. Currently, interferon beta is the primary treatment for multiple sclerosis. However, interferon beta forms aggregates because of poor solubility, resulting in decreased efficacy and increased immunogenicity of this therapeutic. Furthermore, interferon beta forms inclusion bodies during expression in E. coli. The resulting high production costs thus hinder further development of improved variants. Interferon beta variants with improved solubility would have significant commercial potential and benefit patients through increased efficacy and decreased side effects."

This application is to employ an innovative technology - ProCode (for Protein Coding) - to perform affinity panning and isolate candidate binding proteins to a small molecule drug, estrogen (estradiol). The ProCode technology is designed to increase the sensitivity of polypeptide detection from - 10e9 copies level achievable by conventional mass spectroscopy to 1-100 copies (comparable to polymerase chain reaction). At the end of the six-month research period of Phase I, the project is expected to yield cDNA sequences that encode protein(s) capable of specifically interacting with estradiol.

These results were achieved by testing only 260 of a possible 110,592 sequences. In Phase II the company will develop a high-throughput assay system that will allow testing the majority of the predicted sequences. The research will also improve electrostatic functions of the PDA algorithm, and then use this version of the program to re-design the entire xylanase molecule instead of just the active site, thereby finding mutations located away from the active site that effect the protein's characteristics.

The overall goal of this project is to enable the pharmaceutical industry to conduct high-throughput screening (HTS) studies with Fa2N-4 cells, a new cell line created by immortalizing human hepatocytes with SV-40 virus, in order to identify those drug candidates that will likely cause clinically significant drug-drug interactions as a result of their ability to induce (up-regulate) the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) and other drug-metabolizing/transporting enzymes. Enzyme induction by drugs and other agents (such as herbal agent St. John's Wort) is a serious cause of drug-drug interactions; it is responsible for the loss of therapeutic effect of life-saving drugs (such as anti-HIV, anti-cancer and anti-coagulant drugs) and life- modifying drugs (such as oral contraceptive steroids). The US-FDA now considers enzyme induction to be an obstacle to drug approval (i.e., grounds for disapproval), especially for drugs intended for use in combination with anti-HIV or other drugs used to treat life-threatening diseases. Enzyme induction occurs in a highly species-specific manner, such that studies aimed at assessing clinical outcome must be conducted in a human-based system. Currently, the use of primary cultures of human hepatocytes represents the ""gold standard"" for evaluating enzyme-induction potential in vitro, but this approach is limited by an inadequate (and erratic) supply of non-transplantable human liver. Human-derived hepatic cell lines, such as HepG2 cells, do not respond appropriately to those drugs that cause clinically significant enzyme induction because they lack a functional PXR/CAR signaling pathway. However, this signaling pathway is functional in the new line of immortalized human hepatocytes (Fa2N-4 cells), which suggests that these cells can be used to identify drug candidates as enzyme inducers, which will save millions of dollars in failed drug development costs, as well as improve drug safety by reducing the incidence of drug-drug interactions, which are reported to be one of the leading causes of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), which in turn are one of the leading causes of preventable death in the United States."

The adaptive filtering system will be based on the Least-Mean-Square (LMS) algorithm and will exploit the non-linear behavior of LMS to improve system performance. This system will also capitalize on turbo equalization techniques, iterating between equalizer and soft-input soft-output (SISO) demodulation of the quaternary, Multi-h CPM trellis to further improve system performance. Such an iterative adaptive filtering system is directly applicable to UHF SATCOM receivers, specifically receivers complying with the MIL-STD-188-181B/C standards, where narrowband interference and multi-path distortion are of concern. This system is particularly useful in littoral environments, where reflections from the sea surface create multi-path distortion and where ducting conditions can cause an increase in received interference."

Use of these algorithms translates into a more reliable communication system and ultimately a more reliable EKV. Xenotran proposes a three phase program to develop and implement an optimized iterative code on a FPGA platform. This codec will be compatible to legacy IFICS equipment. Specifically, the code rate, block size, and data interface will be chosen for compatibility with existing IFICS equipment to ensure the most confidence, the simplest integration, and the least program risk.

ConstellationT uses innovative adaptive sensor fusion algorithms to optimally blend time-of-flight ultrasonic range measurements with angular rate and linear acceleration data from a proprietary micro-miniature inertial sensing device called the InertiaCubeT. The ConstellationT is a cost-effective, proven technology that delivers sub-centimeter accuracy over a scaleable tracking volume (up to the size of a whole building), with robustness superior to single-technology solutions. In the phase I research, we will analyze techniques for tracking multiple body parts of multiple users, and build a prototype system to demonstrate operation in a projective display environment.

Lithium polysulfide (Li-PS) redox flow batteries (RFBs) have been considered as one of the most promising electrochemical energy storage technologies because of their high energy density, design flexibility, and safe large-scale operation. However, Li-PS RFBs suffer from polysulfide crossover between two working electrodes which decreases the batteriesâ columbic efficiency and shortens their cycle stabilities. Unfortunately, commercial battery separators (e.g. Celgard) and existing ion exchange membranes (e.g. Nafion) cannot be adopted because of their poor lithium ion selectivity over polysulfide ions. By integrating highly ion-selective polymers and nanoengineered pore-filled ion exchange membrane (IEM), our proposed solution will satisfy the desired characteristics of ion selective membranes for Li-PS RFBs, such as high lithium ion selectivity/conductivity, chemical/mechanical stability, low cost. The overall objectives of the Phase I project are to develop novel multifunctional IEMs, investigate fundamental transport properties, evaluate the electrochemical performances, and establish relationship between molecular structures and ion transport properties of the IEMs. During the Phase I, we will focus on (1) molecular-level design of high performance ion exchange polymers; (2) fabrication of nanoengineered pore-filled IEMs; (3) quantitative study of the molecular structure of IEMs and their correlation with ion transport properties (lithium and polysulfide ion) and electrochemical performance using various characterization tools; (4) numerical analysis to systematically investigate ion crossover, electrical potential distribution, and ion concentration distribution during charging/discharging. By the end of Phase I, we will demonstrate a new class of nanoengineered IEMs for Li-PS RFBs and other non-aqueous RFBs. Molecular structure design of ion exchange polymers and their transport properties characterizations will establish structure-property relationships as well as design criteria for high performance IEMs in energy storage applications. Energy storage can bring benefits to all functions of the grid, such as the restoration of quality parameters of energy storage for later use of excess generation, etc. Although all vanadium-based RFB has been widely developed for the power grid, their low energy density (20-60 Wh/L) and high price of vanadium have hindered their practical applications in many energy storages. Thus, the development of Li-PS RFB with high energy density has great potential to address all critical challenges of energy storage systems. Upon success of this program over Phase II or Phase III, our multifunctional IEM technology is expected to mature into a technology which can significantly lower the cost per cycle and enhance the cost-effectiveness of RFB modules. In addition, the results will be used to enhance the fundamental understanding of ion transports through ion exchange polymers for energy storage applications."

Adoption of hydrogen as an energy vector inevitably necessitates the infrastructure of technologies to enable distribution and storage of hydrogen. Xergyâs technological contribution addresses the need to efficiently compress hydrogen gas using electrochemical compression. Compared to traditional mechanical hydrogen compressors, electrochemical compressors should have significantly lower Capital Expense and Operational Expenses at scale. Technical features of electrochemical compression are a solid-state system capable of providing the most efficient compression while being vibration free and noiseless. This makes electrochemical compression more reliable and require less maintenance than conventional mechanical systems. A core component of electrochemical hydrogen compressors is a solid-state ionic membrane that conducts protons. In this program, Xergy along with its partner RPI, is developing a more advanced membrane that exhibits high proton conductivity, very high tensile strength, and the ability to operate at elevated temperatures with minimal humidification requirements. Our concept is to use an ion-pair system â two ionic systems are combined to provide exceptional ionic conductivity; the first immobile ion is anionic, and the second mobile counter ion is cationic. This combination facilitates improved proton transmission over conventional membranes and enhances mechanical resilience due to increased plasticity. Depending on the choice of ionic pair membrane, properties can be tuned to the specific application. In the SBIR phase I effort, Xergy and RPI synthesized 4 different ion-pair membranes and developed composite structures for testing. After considerable performance testing, physical modeling and durability reviews, the team down-selected to one membrane system. We then subsequently tested single cell electrochemical compressors to demonstrate operational feasibility to reduce investment risks and prepare for the SBIR phase II proposals for larger scale systems suitable for prototyping. In this SBIR phase II proposal, Xergy and RPI aim to scale up ionomer and membrane production and build pre-commercial prototypes. The team intends to conduct considerable durability tests in order to demonstrate the viability of this technology for commercial applications. Xergy will test its prototype system on-site at an industrial facility for validation and continue to survey the market for electrochemical compressor utility to determine the proper path for commercialization. Merchant, bulk hydrogen demand is currently a $135 Billion U.S. industry and is growing at an 8% compound annual growth rate. Electrochemical hydrogen compression fills a vital technological gap in hydrogen supply, storage, and its conversion chain. Xergy is a U.S. based technology company, sitting at the forefront of developing and commercializing this critical technology."

Without adequate potable water, society succumbs to human suffering i.e. dehydration, disease and inevitably limited supply results in human conflict. There is therefore a need for an efficient, and cost effective method of producing quality potable water from low grade sources such as brackish or sea water serving small populations and isolated communities. The Companyâs aim is bringing to commercial reality a reasonably low cost, high efficiency method of generating high quality potable water suitable for these small populations and isolated communities. The Companyâs concept is to create a small scale integrated system for potable water supply using a custom water permeable ionomer membrane based vacuum assisted pervaporation distillation system coupled to passive solar non-potable water heating, to improve water purification rate. The system is further integrated with photovoltaic panels and a backup power system (electrolyzer/fuel cell) to make itself contained as well as on-demand electrochemical Ozone production to maintain the purity of the clean water produced. In Phase I the Company demonstrated that the potable water produced by our custom membrane pervaporation system is exceedingly pure, having less than 1/10 the salinity allowed as drinking water and, due to the nanoscale ionomer channels, full elimination of pathogens. The Companyâs single stage, PEM Distillation system with integrated Ozone Disinfection system demonstrated many key features including (a) higher water purity, (b) 50% lower electrical demand, (c) total grid independence (and autonomy), (e) smaller overall footprint, (f) integrated hot water production, (g) the ability to efficiently process a wider range of saline water streams and (h) the ability to use low grade heating in the form of solar (water) heating that is very prevalent in developing nations. In phase II, the Company will develop and install a fully functional, independent, integrated, scalable and highly efficient 100-gallon / day membrane based vacuum desalination system utilizing passive thermal heating & enthalpy of vaporization recycling, providing the highest purity, sanitized via insitu disinfection, potable water (with optional hot water delivery) from seawater. Phase II development focuses on improved component performance, cost reduction and reduction to commercialization to reach the performance and cost goals allowing commercial success. Utilizing current technology, the small commercial desalination plants utilized in Antigua and Barbuda provide potable water at roughly 10x the cost of the large-scale plants in Singapore and Israel. There is both a human need and a commercial need for low cost small desalination plants which our technology addresses. In addition to the U.S. needs in rural and isolated areas such as outlying islands, there is a large need worldwide. While very large scale Reverse Osmosis with disinfection such as used high population density areas along a shore line is very cost effective, The Companyâs technology fits into the small town, island, single home scale where current water solutions are high cost and with high environmental impact."

To date, attempts to create a low energy hybrid hot water heater (HWH) have resulted in hot water heaters that have high differential prices and significant noise and maintenance issues resulting in low sales and low value perception. This Phase IIB Sequential project would continue the development of Xergyâs next generation of low cost, no noise, and high efficiency hybrid hot water heaters which will be suitable for commercial adoption. Xergy Inc. directed by Principal Investigator, William Parmelee is proposing the following project: âAdvanced Hybrid Waterheater using ECCâ, under DOE TOPIC NO.: 03c. Phase I successfully created a New (Electrochemical) Compressor suitable for a 50 gallon Hybrid Hot Water System, that is more efficient than current mechanical compressors and that is also, noiseless, vibration free, modular and scalable utilizing nonGHG refrigerant (water). In Phase II the goal is to create a High Fidelity heat pump hybrid hot water heater in conjunction with General Electric (GE) containing an Electro Chemical Compressor (ECC). Xergy determined in Phase II that while the initial water based vapor phase compression cycle powered by an electrochemical compressor is technically viable; shifting to a metal hydride/Hydrogen sorption/desorption cycle will provide superior performance and reduce the size of the required compressor. Phase IIB In Phase IIB Sequential, Xergy proposes the development of an optimized integrated metal hydride/heat exchanger based heat pump system for a HWH. The key parameter controlling the efficiency of the system is the heat transfer between the hydride and the exterior of the heat exchanger. The need for this product is very clear. More than 70% of electric demand is utilized in buildings, and approximately 15% of residential electric demand is for hot water production. Anything that will reduce that individual subunit demand will significantly reduce our total energy demand, emissions and our dependence on foreign energy sources. This product would also reduce the use of GHG refrigerant, resulting in substantial environmental benefits. Utilizing this technology, would have farreaching positive effects on the HWH market by increasing market penetration for Hybrid units. This is a disruptive and transformational technology that in addition to the target of HHWH could be modified to other applications very easily and quickly for the following appliances: wine chillers, electronic cooling: basically anything that needs cooling above zero C.

This technology requires no maintenance, is quiet, and takes up very little space in a refrigerator, making it superior to other higher cost, high noise and vibration, and large footprint systems employing compressors; and therefore, usable widely by the appliance industry for food preservation. When employing AEMs for inerting, water and oxygen react at the cathode to form hydroxyl ions. The hydroxyl ions transport across the membrane and reform oxygen and water at the anode of the cell.

Xergy Inc. has exhibited a demonstration unit of its Kuel-cell device, and engaged in thermodynamic simulations utilizing water as the working fluid in order to propose the use of this Kuel-cell technology for hybrid hot water systems. Simulations utilizing ProSim Software, have indicated that COPs in the range of 4 (vs. 2.4 for comparable operating conditions provided by GE for GeoSpring hybrid) are attainable in advanced hybrid hot water heaters utilizing the Kuel-CellTM electrochemical compressor. And thus a smaller size 350 Watt compressor can be engaged, with alternative form factors in addition to other benefits such as noiseless and vibration free operation. Key components for this cell have been specified and need to be optimized. A work plan has been provided to develop discrete components and eventually build a bench top prototype during phase 1 of this SBIR program with a vision towards development of a product that can be commercialized during phase II (if awarded). The improved efficiency of the system (i.e. COP) not only enables a smaller size compressor to be utilized, but also results in significant reduction in operating costs (i.e. electric power utilization). In addition, the compressor provides an alternative form factor for designers. When all this is taken in conjunction with other inherent benefits of electrochemical compression such as noise-less operation, vibration free operation, and the use of a non-GWP refrigerant provide a compelling value proposition that would inspire significant market interest and penetration, which in turn would result in the development of serious sales volumes which will be required to attain mass production.

The proposed flexible batteries are made of electrodes realized via directly electroplating high-quality, high-energy battery materials on current collectors. In most existing flexible batteries, battery materials are bonded by polymer binders, resulting in loose contacts during bending and thus loss of battery materials. In contrast, the electroplated materials are chemically bonded to the current collector, which significantly enhances the electrode integrity during repeated bending and deformation. Such strong bonding also enables fast electron transport in the electrode and thus boosts the battery power.

StructurePore batteries utilize a novel manufacturing method, electroplating, which typically is not used in battery manufacturing. Electroplating allows usage of material precursors that are inherently cheaper than refined ceramic powders. These precursors may be cheaper (10-30%) or significantly cheaper (1x-5x) depending on purity. A 53% reduction in raw material cost has been shown to reduce total cost ($/kWh) by 30% at large volume. Furthermore, electroplating reduces process complexity; resulting in decreased reliance on milling and sintering, thus further reducing costs.  Due to their ability to handle high power, StructurePore batteries have inherently low internal resistance, which decreases thermal buildup and stress under normal and even extreme conditions. A 3D conductive current collector, built into all StructurePore batteries, helps to dissipate heat without the need for heat sinks or extensive modification.

The second Specific Aim is the successful in vivo delivery of formulations in clinically relevant doses in a rat model. Formulations will be judged by 1) gt80% dissolution of glucagon in simulated interstitial fluid and 2) lt10% residual drug in the device after administration. In addition, one (1) months of chemical and physical stability (gt95% API content and equivalent viscosity to day 0) of the solid glucagon formulation will be deemed successful. Effective subcutaneous delivery of glucagon will be assessed by measurement of the drug in the blood using radioimmunoassay. Bioavailability of gt80% relative to a control subcutaneous injection of aqueous-reconstituted glucagon in a rat model will be deemed successful.

(including apoptosis assays in activated primary human lung myofibroblasts; cell-free caspase 8 activation
assays; lung injury/fibrogenesis model; pharmacokinetics; bioassay; CYP-450 inhibition studies; cardiotoxicity

peptides in animal models, with no evidences of immunogenicity in state-of-the-art human CD-4+ T-cell and B-
cell assays, and with exceptional stability in human lung microsomal systems and human plasma. The
therapeutic peptide has excellent solubility in water. These features should facilitate administration by
subcutaneous injection once per week (~ 50-200 Î¼L) with excellent bioavailability during preclinical PK
studies judging by the steady-state release in plasma of the peptide from the PEG-30kDa-Peptide, achieving
therapeutic lung concentrations. Xfibra will maintain the inhalation route as an alternative formulation for
development. The proposed compound markedly inhibits the activation of human lung myofibroblast in culture
and in vivo in mice. This compound was not toxic to mice in the preliminary toxicology studies, at least at 100-
fold the therapeutic dose. We found no evidence of liver, lung or cardiac toxicity or inhibition of CYP-450
isoenzymes. The Aims of this SBIR are to complete FDA-mandated, IND-enabling studies. The
available IPF medications are very expensive, and not highly effective in most patients. The FDA agreed with
Xfibra to proceed with IND-enabling studies for XFB-19 (Pre-IND # 131245).PROJECT NARRATIVE
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), through inflammation and injury induces the development of scar tissue in
the lung; this is called lung fibrosis.
The personal, medical and financial burden of IPF is substantial, and IPF is associated with a very poor

Technological advances in large wind turbines will enable power generation for communities and businesses at less than the average cost of utility generation and roof-top solar, and half the average cost of competing small wind turbines. This process would not fluctuate in time as much as solar installations, decreasing stress on grid infrastructure. Locally-owned generation will alleviate fluctuating energy prices and protect against grid failure. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to reduce the cost of wind energy from small wind turbines by at least 60%, making low-cost distributed renewable energy an affordable reality for communities and businesses. Vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) have the potential for lower capital and maintenance costs than traditional horizontal-axis machines due to their mechanical simplicity. However, low efficiency and structural failure have plagued previous VAWT commercialization efforts. This SBIR Phase II project will optimize several subsystems and components of the drivetrain and rotor for efficiency, cost, and robustness in extreme environmental conditions through analysis, bench-top testing, and field experiments.

This project has the potential to increase global wind power production through technological advancements that lower installation, operations, and maintenance costs via an innovative design which addresses reliability and efficiency concerns that have previously limited the penetration of VAWTs into the wind energy market. Compared to the common horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT), the proposed technology requires an order of magnitude fewer components. Additionally, heavy and maintenance intensive components are located at ground level for ease of access. One initial market for this technology will be stand-alone, small-scale generation, where this technology will provide long-lasting, low-maintenance power for remote locations. Another initial market is the repowering and augmentation of existing wind turbine arrays. Here, this technology will be a cost effective method of revitalizing underperforming or aging HAWT farms. The long-term objective is large-scale, VAWT-only arrays. Recent scientific advances indicate that, unlike HAWTs, interactions between VAWTs can be beneficial, resulting in cost-effective, high-output wind farms. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to address the reliability and efficiency concerns that have previously limited the penetration of VAWTs into the wind energy market. XFlow Energy's novel design utilizes a robust, stationary central shaft extending the length of the rotor, reducing harmful loading to the rotor structure. This design requires a larger central shaft than VAWTs tested to date, and the impact of a large central shaft on VAWT power output has not been previously investigated. Laboratory-scale tests will be performed on a range of geometries to analyze the fluid-dynamic impact of larger central shafts and the resulting changes in turbine performance and loading. This information will inform the design and structural simulation of a 500 W turbine. This design will be prototyped and will undergo thorough performance measurements. Ultimately destructive testing will be performed to identify structural deficiencies, and the design updated appropriately.

XGS will use graphene functionalization to tailor the properties of the composite material that will be produced in XGSâ existing low-cost manufacturing equipment. XGSâ Si/graphene composite anode is based on a unique nano-structure design and an innovative compositing process that utilizes graphene to mitigate cycling stability issues of Silicon (Si) particles during cycling.
During Phase I, XGS will work with partners Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Georgia Institute of Technology on optimization of the nanomaterial construction focusing on the silicon/ graphene interface. This will focus on management of lithium consumption through extended formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) as well as silicon particle support.
The broad market for LIB anode material was $0.7B in 2015 and is expected to grow by double digits year over year for the foreseeable future due to the combined market demand coming from consumer electronics and mobility including xEVs, electric buses, e-bikes, and other applications related to the emerging âun-pluggedâ connected society. This demand for stored energy comes with a strong interest in reduced size and weight required per Watt-hr of energy.

The success of Li-ion batteries (LiBs) in such markets strongly depends on the cost, energy density, power capability, cycle life, and safety of the battery cells, which are largely dominated by the electrode materials used. While LiB technologies have advanced significantly, the DOE EV Everywhere program EV cell target of 400 Wh/kg with 1000 cycles, at cost of ownership comparable to conventional ICE vehicles cannot be met with current LiB chemistries, especially with graphite as the anode due to its low capacity. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop advanced anodes for future generation Li-ion batteries. Silicon is considered as the most promising anode material due to its high capacity and proper working voltage. XGS proposes to develop a high performance Silicon (Si)/graphene composite anode via a low cost process to enable EV and HEV LiB applications. With a combination of a composite Si/graphene anode structure design, LiB electrode engineering with grapheme nanoplatelets, and a proven low-cost material manufacturing process, XGS is well positioned to mass produce and sell this material in large volume once the technical barriers in battery performance are overcome.

Narcotic addiction is especially worrisome since intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) also promotes HIV transmission. Reducing IVDA is critical to lowering the incidence of HIV. Sincegt75% of IVDA is with opioids, effective treatment of opiate addiction should markedly reduce IVDA and lower HIV transmission rates. Naltrexone has markedly lowered relapse rates and shortened treatment time in opiate-addicted patients when combined withstandard behavioral therapies. This efficacy, however, is dependent upon strict adherence, and monitoring this adherence relies primarily upon directly observed therapy (DOT). The focus of this program is to develop a novel medication adherence monitoringsystem that can realistically monitor whether narcotic addicts actually ingest their oral naltrexone on a regular basis, completely independent of DOT. In this patented system, innocuous  taggants  (chosen from FDA  Generally Recognized as Safe  list)are  packaged  with the active pharmaceutical ingredient (e.g., naltrexone) into a  smart  drug formulation. After the drug is ingested and enters the stomach, the taggant is released and rapidly metabolized to a volatile metabolite. Detection of the volatile metabolite in the breath verifies oral ingestion of the drug. We previously established that this system, directed at accurately assessing adherence in humans, is technically feasible. Notable development findings include: 1) secondary (2o) alcohols (e.g., 2-butanol) are superior taggants metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH is not subject to genetic polymorphisms, unlike the isoform) to generate volatile ketones (e.g., 2-butanone) exhaled in breath, 2) a miniature gas chromatography-metal oxide sensor (mGC-MOS) has been created to measure ketones in human breath, 3) multiple taggants can be readily incorporated into the system to monitor adherence for several drugs, and 4) food does not interfere with the system. We now propose to specificallyadapt and expand this core technology to manage opioid-addicted patients with HIV/AIDS. To that end, the following 2 aims will be achieved: Aim 1: Create 8 SMART capsule-based naltrexone systems using 4 general types of pharma formulation strategies. Model naltrexone (50 mg) formulations containing the GRAS taggant, 2-butanol (25 or 40 mg) will be prepared and preliminary stability studies executed: Type 1) hydrophobic system, Type 2) hydrophilic system, Type 3) reverse micelle system, and Type 4) water-in-oil microemulsion system (Months 1-6). Aim 2: Select the best naltrexone formulation and test mGC-MOS performance in healthy volunteers in the UF Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI). Using a double blind, randomized, crossover study design, the relationship between the breath concentration (measured via mGC-MOS and gas chromatography mass spectroscopy [GC-MS]) of 2-butanol (taggant) and 2-butanone (metabolite) versus time will be determined after the oral administration of 3 promising naltrexone formulations selected from Aim 1 or a positive control (Months 7-12). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this Phase I SBIR program is to develop a novel breath-based medication adherence monitoring system that can realistically monitor whether opiate addicts with HIV/AIDS actually ingest (definitive adherence) their oral naltrexone on a regular basis, completely independent of the need for directly observed therapy."

Anesthesia personnel customarily measure the concentrations in breath of many agents used during surgery including: molecular oxygen to prevent hypoxia, carbon dioxide to assure placement of an endotracheal tube in the trachea and adequate ventilation, and anesthetics (e.g., desflurane, nitrous oxide) to maintain the appropriate  level of consciousness /depth of anesthesia. Recently, several independent research teams have demonstrated that patients receiving IV propofol eliminate a fraction of this anesthetic in the breath. Also, the concentration of propofol in breath correlates to and is therefore predictive ofits free blood concentration. Therefore, the possibility exists to determin and manipulate the blood concentration of propofol using real-time, point-of-care measurement of exhaled propofol levels to guide its dosing. This ability will be similar to techniques already employed for volatile anesthetics and will improve patient safety. Unfortunately, the current research tools (e.g., proton transfer reaction-mass spectroscopy [PTR-MS], gas chromatography- mass spectroscopy [GC-MS]) used to measure propofol inbreath consists of sensitive, large, very expensive equipment that requires skilled, personnel to operate. Clearly, the development of novel technology that is small, robust, reliable, and easily operated for measuring exhaled propofol levels is a prerequisite for clinical acceptance. The goal of this grant proposal is to design, build, and test a prototype device to measure exhaled propofol. The innovation of this application is leveraging previous development by the Department of Defense by adapting polymer coated surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology to detect propofol at clinically relevant concentrations. To this end, the following specific aims will be achieved: Aim 1: Design and build a SAW detector with improved circuitry, miniature valving, an improved collection tubing to patient, and CO2-gated collection (4 months). Aim 2: Measure and compare propofol concentrations in exhaled breath (using SAW and conventional GC- MS) to those in plasma (using UPLC) in human patients (n=15) anesthetized with propofol. (8 months) The short term objective of Xhale, Inc. is to research and develop these devices for later introduction into the US market, projected to exceed 341 million by 2013. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Propofol endures as a commonly usedintravenous anesthetic and has recently been demonstrated to emanate from the lung in concentrations proportionate to blood concentrations. The goal of this project is to design, build, and test a prototype device to measure exhaled propofol in order to estimate human blood concentrations in real-time and to improve the safety of patients anesthetized with this agent."

The estimated annual cost of ethanol abuse in the United States is 185B. A new breath-based toxicological tool with superior capabilities dedicated to understanding the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ethanol is needed to combat alcohol abuse and understand its origins. Current devices used to measure ethanol in human breath rely on technologies that are several decades old, which limit the sensitivity and specificity of ethanol detection and poorly separate ethanol from confounding analytes in breath. We propose to develop a new generation of evidential (generates high quality data that is directly introduced into courts as legal evidence) breath-based ethanol sensors to combat ethanol abuse in the 21st century. A multi-disciplinary team (physicians, engineers, chemists, addiction experts, and forensic toxicologists) will collectively develop a miniature gas chromatograph metal oxide sensor (mGC-MOS) device for real-time, point-of-use detection of ethanol and other analytes. NIAAA SBIR Phase I support was used to 1) design and construct a mGC-MOS to detect ethanol in real-time, 2) demonstrate the mGC-MOS has outstanding specificity and accuracy, and can readily discriminated between ethanol and other analytes (e.g., acetone, methanol), which commonly interfere with the function of present sensor technologies, and 3) establish mGC-MOS accuracy in humans intoxicated with ethanol in the University of Florida (UF) General Clinical Research Center (GCRC). We now propose to expand this work to refine, construct, and examine the performance characteristics of the next generation breath ethanol analyzer, an evidential mGC-MOS. To that end, the following 3 specific aims will be achieved: Specific Aim 1: Design and build an improved mGC-MOS device with a single GC column (vis- -vis current dual column configuration) that accurately and precisely measures ethanol concentrations in real-time. (Milestone: 10/31/2010). Specific Aim 2: Demonstrate that the mGC-MOS meets or exceeds evidential breath analyzer performance using established industry standards as enumerated by the Organisation Internationale de Metrologie Legale. (Milestone: 12/31/2010). Specific Aim 3: Validate and use the mGC-MOS as a research tool to investigate the pharmacokinetic/dynamic and cognitive effects of a moderate dose of alcohol in older and younger social drinkers. (Milestone: 03/31/2012). The mGC-MOS being developed will not only 1) provide a superior dataset from ethanol PK/PD clinical studies, but also 2) improve testing in law enforcement and workplace settings by bringing the power of evidential ethanol breath analysis to point-of-use environments, while markedly lowering the cost of evidential testing (lt 1,000 mGC-MOS system versus gt 100,000 current units). Our long term goal is to expand the utility of this novel mGC-MOS technology in order to effectively address other major medical problems, including drugs of abuse, medication adherence, and functional interrogation of CYP-450 enzyme competency. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current devices used to measure ethanol in human breath rely on technologies that are several decades old, which limit the sensitivity and specificity of ethanol detection and poorly separate ethanol from confounding analytes in human breath. We propose to develop a new generation of portable, evidential breath-based ethanol sensors with superior capabilities to understand the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ethanol and to combat ethanol abuse in the 21st century.

The system consists of a miniature, battery powered gas chromatograph (the device) capable of measuring volatile metabolites (e.g., butanone) on an individual&#039;s breath after ingestion of a medication containing taggants (e.g., 2-butanol). This data can be sent to and evaluated by health care personnel via HIPAA-compliant information technology to allow opportunity to improve medication adherence. In Phase II activities, we propose a plan to optimize the design of the adherence system. The proposal consists of 7 aims. Specific Aim 1: Chemistry - characterize generally recognized as safe taggants for definitive adherence in humans. a) Determine breath pharmacokinetic parameters of two definitive taggants and their key volatile metabolites in fasting humans (months 1-6), and b) create a chemistry backup program to develop new definitive taggants (months 1-24). [Specific Aim 2: Food Interference - further validate that food does not interfere with this adherence system (months 6-12)]. Note: new aims are bracketed and in Georgia font. Specific Aim 3: Pharmacy - optimize the means whereby taggants are interfaced to pharmaceutical products for definitive adherence (months 1-24). Specific Aim 4: Portable Gas Sensor - finalize design of the mGC-MOS, a) optimize mGC and MOS components of mGC-MOS unit, b) design, implement and optimize a breath collection device, and c) identify a contract manufacturer (months 1-12). [Specific Aim 5: Information Technology and Data Processing - develop methods and techniques to locally store, transmit, remotely archive, and distribute adherence data in a HIPAA-compliant manner. Develop signal processing algorithms to improve taggant detection accuracy of device. (months 1-12) Specific Aim 6: Adherence System Accuracy - Conduct a pilot study in humans to test system performance (months 12-18). Specific Aim 7: Behavioral (Usability) Adherence System Evaluation - Conduct a pilot study in high risk, HIV/AIDS patients to test acceptance of the system (months 18-24).] The ability to stratify medication adherence rates to safety and efficacy parameters and linking adverse events to medication ingestion will lead to optimal decisions regarding clinical trial drugs safety and efficacy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nonadherence to prescribed medication regimens is a major health issue in the US which costs our healthcare system over 100 billion annually. Nonadherence is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It can result in a public health threat if, for instance, a patient fails to adhere to an antibiotic or antiviral medication. This can lead to the emergence of resistant organisms. We propose to develop a small portable device that a patient can blow into shortly after taking their medication which will detect and document that the appropriate medication was taken at the proper time. This technology should improve adherence rates, especially in high-risk populations, and provide pharmaceutical companies and the FDA with an improved data set for evaluating drugs in clinical trials."

The current methodology used to measure ethanol concentration in breath relies on decades old technology and may limit development of breath analysis to detect not only ethanol with great specificity, but also a number of other compounds that appear in breath. Therefore, the overall goal of the present grant is to prepare the scientific foundations and an actual prototype of a new generation of breath-analysis equipment and software to address the public health needs of the twenty-first century. This proposal describes the current and proposed activities of a multi-disciplinary team of physical and medical scientists who are evaluating use of a mini-gas chromatograph (mini-GC) device and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collected using active breath management as alternative matrices for real-time, point-of-use measurement of ethanol concentration with preservation of samples for later analysis, if necessary. The applicants have constructed a mini-GC modified to detect ethanol in a real-time manner with excellent specificity that can accurately discriminate between ethanol and other molecules (e.g., acetone, methanol, toluene) that may interfere with alternative technologies used to detect ethanol in breath. Using novel breath handling techniques that gate breath collection to end-tidal carbon dioxide concentrations, we show that ethanol appears in the EBC, at concentrations similar to those measured in blood, following oral consumption of alcohol (3-5 ounces). The appearance of DNA in EBC alludes to the possibility of a ""self-identifying tag"" to reliably and accurately link an EBC sample to an individual subject source. The goal of this proposal is to expand these findings to refine, construct, and examine the performance characteristics of a mini-GC coupled to an EBC collector. To that end, the following specific aims will be achieved: Specific Aim 1: Design and build a mini-GC device coupled to an EBC collector with active breath management that reliably measures ethanol concentrations in real-time collects and preserves EBC for later analysis. (Milestone: Availability of device by 10/15/2007). Specific Aim 2: Correlate gaseous and EBC ethanol concentrations measured by this device in human subjects with concentrations found in venous blood and document the absence of oral fluid contamination during several different temperatures, normal or hyperventilating breathing patterns, and with/without active breath management. (Milestone: Completion of performance data by 12/31/2007). The short term objective of Xhale Diagnostics, Inc. is to develop these devices to a market of $70 million. The long term objectives of the investigators are to develop breath-based detection technology to enable medical diagnostics as sheltered by intellectual property licensed from the University of Florida."

MAMS will consistent of a modified miniature battery powered gas chromatograph (mGC) capable of detecting the presence of a ""taggant"" or a metabolite of the taggant on the breath of an individual shortly after ingestion of a medication containing it. MAMS will include hardware and software capable of recording the detection of the ""taggant"", storing the information for later analysis, and notifying, in real-time by wireless or other communications, a healthcare provider if medication is not taken as prescribed. We will explore FDA approved ""generally recognized as safe"" (GRAS) compounds as taggants. The ""taggants"" can be applied as a coating to the medication, be added along with the medication to a special capsule or be added as an excipient. We have considerable expertise in the detection of drugs in exhaled breath and are knowledgeable about the properties of candidate ""taggants"" and their metabolites. Our Specific Aims are: Specific Aim 1: Identify 6-8 chemically diverse taggant candidates from GRAS compound databases that will likely generate appropriate EDIM(s) at doses currently permitted by the FDA in exhaled breath after oral ingestion. Either the taggant or taggant metabolite(s) could qualify as an EDIM. Specific Aim 2: Test whether the GRAS taggant candidates identified in Specific Aim 1 are suitable for MAMS in humans by sequentially analyzing the concentrations of taggant(s) and taggant metabolite(s) in breath after oral ingestion of the taggant using the ""gold standard"" analytical technique, GC-MS. Specific Aim 3: Design and build a mGC device to reliably measure in real-time the gas phase concentration of two suitable EDIMs identified in Specific Aim 2.

This project proposes a blood bag capable of preserving the overall health and vigor of stored blood, including rare blood types, and extending the shelf life of blood and platelets. Donated blood begins to degrade on day 11 and expires on day forty-two. Platelets expire within 5-7 days of storage. By increasing the shelf-life of healthy blood, the proposed technology decreases waste and addresses the shortage of blood supplies around the world. The current global blood shortage is 30 M units per year, and 18 M units of donated blood are wasted due to expiration. Globally, 400 M people with rare blood types don't have consistent access due to the cost of frozen rare blood. Degradation in red blood cells due to oxygen exposure and other factors begin as early as days 11 - 21 after collection, impacting post-transfusion recovery by increasing mortality, serious infections, multi-organ failure, thrombosis, and the length of the hospital stay. Increasing the functional health of stored human blood and extending its viability beyond forty-two days will dramatically impact the health of patients around the world. The proposed project aims to develop new polymer nanocomposite-based plastics and blood bags by using the anti-oxidative and antimicrobial activity of nanoparticles within the composite plastic. The three main objectives of the proposed Phase 1 project are to develop functional polymer nanocomposite plastics and films, determine the effect of nanoparticles on human RBCs and platelets in response to storage and to develop a prototype polymer nanocomposite blood bag and test its efficacy to increase the shelf life and functional health of human blood and platelets. The project applies interdisciplinary tools to advance polymer nanocomposite bags while taking into consideration stringent requirements of physicochemical and mechanical properties for this unique application. The challenge is to balance the essential requirements of a blood bag while ensuring the efficacy with no leaching of nano materials during blood storage. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our intent is to produce an optimized bar design, show that it leads to significant improvements over the best prototype designs to date, and produce a Phase II detector module design that fully meets NEXT's neutron detector needs. With an eye toward commercialization, our Sandia collaborators will both produce our test sample and also investigate improved casting and surface finishing techniques for lowering bar production costs. A successful project will lead to sales of OGM material and SiPM arrays in detectors, detector modules, and complete instruments. Detectors type will range from small forms for R&D purposes to larger volumes for portal monitors detector. Detector modules, including SiPM arrays, will include NEXT detectors and other custom applications. Complete instruments, combining detector modules with XIA's processing electronics, are suitable for neutron monitors in proton beam therapy.

To detect related events, time synchronization of the detector readout electronics is essential. In most existing large digital data acquisition systems, time synchronization is accomplished by sharing clock, trigger, and reset signals within and between chassis. This works well over short distances, but requires dedicated cabling and/or modules and becomes cumbersome for widely separated arrays. Statement of how it is being addressed: Recently, techniques and standards have been developed to synchronize time in network devices, for example the âPrecision Time Protocolâ (IEEE 1588) and the higher performance âWhite Rabbitâ project. These techniques can reach low/sub-nanosecond time synchronization between processors. In this project, these techniques will be used to develop a practical, compatible, low cost product for nuclear physics applications, i.e. bringing the precision network timing to the front end data acquisition where detector pulses are detected, captured and timestamped. Achievements in Phase I: An existing detector readout module, the Pixie-Net, was adapted in hardware and firmware to tag detector events with timestamps derived from the network time synchronization techniques. It achieved time resolutions in the range of 1300ns to 200ps, depending on signal source, network, and synchronization technique. A concept for software triggering was developed, based on timestamped data rather than hard wired trigger pulses. Plans for Phase II: The Pixie-Net will be upgraded to be fully compatible with the White Rabbit technique, for higher precision, more readout channels, and higher data bandwidth. The software triggering concept will be implemented as an open source data acquisition prototype, for researchers to use as is or to integrate in a larger software framework. For backwards compatibility, converters and adapters to existing shared clock techniques will be developed. Commercial applications and other benefits: The primary benefit of the project is to enable researchers to synchronize detector readout electronics in physically separated systems. This will simplify large nuclear physics experiments, by reducing cabling requirements and by making it easier to merge data streams from different systems (since tagged with universal date/time). Beyond nuclear physics research, the technique may be used in homeland security (e.g. synchronizing portal monitors) or astrophysics (e.g. synchronizing arrays of cosmic ray detectors).

Arrays from the same experiment can be physically separated â in different rooms, near and remote to a target, and/or at different positions in the beam. To detect related events, time synchronization of the detector readout electronics is essential. Most existing large digital data acquisition systems for radiation detectors consist of a host computer linked to one or more chassis containing multi-channel detector readout electronics modules. Time synchronization in such systems is accomplished by sharing clock and reset signals within and between chassis. This works well over short distances, but requires dedicated cabling and/or modules and becomes cumbersome for widely separated arrays. Recently, timing techniques and standards have been developed to synchronize network devices (i.e. processors). The most relevant in this discussion is the Precision Time Protocol defined in the IEEE 1588 standard that has been shown to reach low/sub-nanosecond time synchronization between processors. In the proposed effort, this standard will be used to develop a practical, compatible, low cost product for nuclear physics applications, i.e. bringing the precision network timing to the front end data acquisition where detector pulses are detected, captured and timestamped. An existing detector readout electronics module, the Pixie-Net, will be adapted in hardware and firmware to tag detector events with timestamps derived from the network time synchronization. While focusing on the current IEEE 1588 standard for immediate results, the implementation will allow for compatibility with other efforts improving or exceeding the standard, such as the âWhite Rabbitâ project. Time resolution measurements will characterize performance and results will be compared to traditional clock sharing. A concept for software triggering will be developed, based on timestamped data rather than hard wired trigger pulses. Commercial applications and other benefits: The primary benefit of the proposed project is to provide researchers with a solution to synchronize detector data acquisition in physically separated systems. This is useful to reduce the complexity of large nuclear physics experiments, by reducing cabling requirements and in some instances allowing measurements that would not be feasible otherwise. The electronics developed in this project is designed to be practical, compatible, low cost, and can be used to upgrade existing readout electronics.

We developed a new preamplifier design whose noise performance was improved by a factor of 4 and is now limited by the FET input capacitance.

Analyzing these data, we demonstrated that noise levels were sufficiently low to allow emission points to be localized, ionization track orientations determined, and charge distributions identified â our Phase I proof of principle goals.

Gamma-ray spectroscopy is a key tool in this field, but no instrument exists that exploits the intrinsically high energy resolution and detection sensitivity of high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors while operating at high output count rates in the few 100 kcps to 1 Mcps range. The proposed work overcomes the high count-rate technical constraints of standard (high-capacitance) HPGe gamma-ray detectors by developing a multi-contact device with signal electrodes of a few pF capacitance. The technical approach combines the high electric field strength and intrinsically fast rise times of a planar detector with the collection efficiency of a coaxial device. Phase I will employ an electrostatic modeling program to investigate different multi-contact configurations on a 15 mm thick planar HPGe detector to calculate electrode capacitance and charge drift times, and to create a design that optimizes the geometry, contact width and spacing to meet or exceed the required specifications. The efficacy of the charge collection and capacitance model will be checked against measurements on an existing segmented HPGe planar detector.  To gain sufficient collection efficiency for gamma-rays in the MeV range, the final detector design will use two back-to-back planar detectors. A second task in Phase I will be to design the detector housing, HPGe crystal mounts and internal connections, and explore options for the FETs and preamplifiers. An analysis of the electronic noise and the detection efficiency at 662 keV will also be made.  Phase I will culminate with the design of the complete detector assembly and housing to be fabricated and tested in Phase II. We are in discussions with the leading segmented HPGe detector manufacturer for fabrication and eventual commercialization of the multi-contact detector. When combined with high rate multi-channel spectroscopy electronics, it is expected that the detector system will provide data throughput rates around 300 kcps per channel (at about 1 Mcps input) with electronic noise in the 500-600 eV FWHM range. This will present a significant advance for nuclear safeguards instrumentation with increased speed and accuracy of detection and identification in high count rate applications. As a unique tool for high rate and high resolution gamma spectroscopy, other applications are foreseen in areas such as medical imaging, and materials defect analysis by positron emission spectroscopy."

For the next generation there is a need for detectors that are light and stable enough for mobile operation while achieving MDLs of order 0.1 mBq/m3 or below so that radioxenon background levels can be characterized, preferably with little or no shielding or current MDLs attained with much shorter collection and measurement times. Since the major limitations to achieving lower MDLs are background counts arising from Compton scattering, the memory effect (residual counts from previous samples), and interferences between the radioxenon isotopes, we are proposing a novel / scintillation counter that eliminates the memory effect, reduces Compton scattering by reducing detector mass, and eliminates interferences by geometric partitioning decay products between multiple detectors. In Phase I we will demonstrate feasibility by producing a GEANT model of the new design, which will be verified by comparison to experiments with the detector & apos;s components..

In such detectors, the position measurement is generally achieved by dividing or segmenting the electrodes into many strips or pixels and then reading out the signals from all electrode segments. This requires complex detector fabrication and signal readout processes and is often associated with high cost, low yield, and high power requirements. There clearly is a need for a detector technology that can achieve fine position resolution while maintaining the excellent energy resolution intrinsic to semiconductor detectors, can be fabricated through simple processes, does not require complex electrical interconnections to the detector, and can reduce the number of required channels of readout electronics.

Imaging with HPGe, Si or CdZTe is an increasing segment of radiation detection. Position sensitive implementations needed for imaging or tracking of radiation are most often realized by segmenting the electrical contacts in one or two dimensions. In order to achieve sufficient position resolution, many segments have to be implemented which is associated with complex fabrication processes to obtain a reliable and high-resolution detector and a complex and costly readout scheme to process the signals from each segment. The yield in the fabrication as well the reliability of operation, and the performance of high-energy and position resolution and large-volume semiconductors suffer due to these complexities. We propose to develop and demonstrate an alternative approach to obtain a position-sensitive detection of radiation, which is significantly easier to realize and provides excellent position resolution, reliability, and superior flexibility in adjusting segmentation and readout schemes according to experiment-specific requirements. The proposed approach of employing close-proximity electrodes to obtain energies and positions of radiation interaction will enable a significantly simpler detector fabrication process and readout configuration. It will provide the ability to adjust the resolution according to experimental requirements without re-fabricating the detector. In addition, close proximity electrodes can be used to measure specific charge losses due to charge collection on non-contact surfaces. Such processes are observed in semiconductor detectors due to imperfect surfaces and passivation techniques. Employing proximity electrodes close to these non-contact surfaces will allow us to observe these events which deteriorate the performance of the detector. These events can then be further processed to improve the response of the detector. Another major benefit of the proximity sensor approach is that charge appears and is fully integrated on all electrodes, dispensing with the need for computationally expensive spectator signals.

Existing systems are also very complex, requiring cryocoolers to reach the operating temperatures for germanium detectors or multiple detectors for beta/gamma coincidence rejection. In the proposed effort, silicon detectors will be explored as a possible alternative to existing radioxenon detector systems.

On the other hand, their detection efficiency is lower, so that the Phase I goal was a careful study of the improvements and drawbacks compared to the existing detector system. Prototypes of silicon detectors will be developed and built in Phase II. In Phase I, radiation interactions in Si were simulated and test measurements were performed with reference sources to obtain resolutions and efficiencies at key energies as well as detector backgrounds. These results were used to compute the minimum detectable concentration for Xe isotopes (e.g. 0.13 mBq/m3 for 133Xe) and compare them to specifications for existing systems (1.0 mBq/m3). Following discussions with detector manufacturers, design concepts for Phase II prototype detectors were established. In Phase II, several prototype Si detectors will be built, operated with existing electronics, and evaluated for their performance through test measurements and quantitative spectrum analysis. This includes design and manufacture of the prototypes, firmware/software upgrades for the electronics and development of analysis routines that process the raw energy spectra to compute concentrations of Xe isotopes. Commercial applications and Other Benefits: The technology to be developed in this project, if successful, will support the efforts by US agencies and the International Monitoring System established by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty to monitor radioxenon from nuclear explosions and background sources by giving them a more precise tool to detect and distinguish Xe isotopes.

For example, current detectors do not have adequate energy resolution for use in the soft x-ray regime (0.2 ÃÂ¿ 2.0 KeV). This is an issue because much important science could be done if adequate detectors were available. In the past 5-10 years, superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) detectors have been developed that are capable of delivering 10-20 eV energy resolution at high count rates in this soft x-ray regime. However, because these detectors are tiny (200 ÃÂµm x 200 ÃÂµm), they need to be used in arrays of 100s or 1,000s to be effective. This project will develop low cost, easy to use electronics to support such large arrays cost effectively, so that a 1,000-element STJ detector array could be purchased for the same price as the large HPGe now being used in the hard x-ray regime, while delivering 100s of times more counts with at least 5-times-better energy resolution.

To address this need, the DOE's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has developed a Radionuclide Aerosol Sampler/Analyzer (RASA) that extracts sub-micron particulates of nuclear debris from the atmosphere by filtering 20,000 cubic meters of air per day.  If nuclear debris is detected, the protocol specifies that the filter be divided into an archival piece plus two pieces to be sent to Certified Laboratories for confirmatory test. The difficulty with this protocol is that if the number of debris fragments is small, it is difficult to assure that all three pieces are representative. This project will develop technology to provide this assurance. The technique is based on the fact that fission fragments are strong alpha particle emitters. A recently developed ultra-low-background alpha counter will be expanded to image the ionization tracks produced by alpha particles and thereby locate the fission fragments from which the alpha particles emanate. In Phase I, an existing detector will be outfitted with a modified anode and existing electronics. The modified detector will be used to capture data from an alpha source, and algorithms will be developed to identify the alpha particle ionization tracks. As a proof of principle, at least 1 cm FWHM spatial resolution will be demonstrated, and a commercially viable instrument will be designed. This effort will lay the groundwork for Phase II, in which a counter will be developed that can locate fission fragments on RASA filters with a spatial resolution of 5 mm FWHM or better. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Applications for the proposed technology fall into three broad areas: (1) support for the network of RASA detectors that is being deployed worldwide; (2) support for DOE ultra-low background detector programs (e.g. Majorana) where large numbers of detector parts must be screened for low alpha emissivity; and (3) use in environmental and remediation measurements where the detector's spatial resolution would allow a large number of low level samples to be counted in parallel."

Because existing gamma ray spectrometers do not have adequate energy resolution to resolve the emission lines central to these analyses, superconducting transition edge microcalorimeters are being developed to achieve the required energy resolution. Further, because the mass of each microcalorimeter is small, they must be fabricated in large arrays. In turn, this will require compact, low cost readout electronics with good energy resolution and higher count rate capability; otherwise, the overall instrument would not be practical. In this project, the high precision digital readout electronics and digital filter algorithms, which had previously been developed for germanium detectors, will be adapted to microcalorimeters. Energy resolutions comparable to the existing electronics should be achievable, but with much higher throughput. The goal will be the development of compact electronics that can be built at a price of $100 per channel with automated software for setup, calibration, and monitoring for 100-1000 channels. In Phase I, the hardware and processing algorithms of exisiting digital electronics for germanium detectors will be modified for microcalorimeter detectors, based on results from initial off-line analysis of captured signal pulses. The performance of the modified system will be tested on a microcalorimeter at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. A preliminary design and cost estimate of a multi-channel prototype board will be created for construction in Phase II. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The proposed approach to enhancing the detection and deterence of nuclear proliferation and resultant increases in national security carries a high public benefit, in and of itself. Providing electronics for the required verification instruments should also carry some modest commercial success, with projected sales of a few million dollars. These instruments, however, have much wider areas of application in various scientific experiments employing arrays of microcalorimeters for X-ray or gamma-ray spectroscopy. In particular, there is a significant effort at NIST and elsewhere to develop similar instruments for quality control in semiconductor processing."

Gamma cameras are finding increasing applications in diverse medical fields ranging from SPECT cameras for emergency room cardiological screening through scintimammography cameras for detecting breast cancer to small animal cameras used in metabolic and drug development studies. Present cameras, constructed using position sensitive photomultiplier tubes and analog processing electronics are bulky, heavy, and expensive. We have developed a preliminary gamma camera design that uses solid state PSAPD detectors and high density digital processing electronics to create a compact camera design that will weigh only 10-20% of existing designs, have significantly improved imaging quality, and cost half as much. A preliminary analysis shows that, to reap these benefits, it is necessary to fully understand the PSAPD's electronic noise properties and design the processing electronics to maximize signal/noise in order to optimize spatial resolution and image quality. The Phase I effort will therefore be devoted to extensively characterizing a PSAPD's noise properties as a function of temperature and signal processing variables and making measurements with small scintillator arrays to determine achievable spatial resolution. The preliminary design will be turned into a complete design with specified parts and modeled and analyzed to accurately project both its performance characteristics and production costs. The Phase II effort would then consist of constructing a pair of gamma cameras based on the Phase I design: a 21 cm x 21 cm camera with 2 mm spatial resolution intended for cardiology work and a 10 cm x 10 cm camera with 1 mm intrinsic spatial resolution intended for small animal work. Both cameras would then be subjected to a wide variety of point source and phantom imaging tests to fully characterize and optimize their performance."

In order to evaluate such schemes and document their performance, it will be necessary to quantifying changes in soil carbon stocks. However, current methods for quantifying carbon in soils (by core sampling, infra-red and LIBS spectroscopy) are invasive, slow, and relatively expensive. This project will develop a new non-invasive technology, Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS), for static and dynamic in situ carbon monitoring in soil, which will speed up the rate of analysis at reduced cost and improve sampling statistics. The instrument will employ up to 16 gamma-ray detectors in a cost effective manner. Phase I will upgrade an existing exploratory system at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) with new multi-channel data acquisition electronics, leading to a small, low power device, which will be compatible with field use. Performance evaluations at BNL will be used to design a commercial prototype in Phase II. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The INS system should be a major advance over core sampling and laboratory analysis. Applications include: (1) monitoring soil for carbon sequestration, (2) improved soil management for agriculture (e.g., till versus no-till), and (3) advances in carbon cycle science (in agronomics, forest science, and ecology) by the rapid measurement of soil carbon on large scales."

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has developed an Automated Radioxenon Sampler/Analyzer (ARSA) that concentrates Xe from the atmosphere and then counts it using a nuclear beta-gamma coincidence counter. Although extremely sensitive, this system employs 12 photomultiplier tubes to count 4 sample cells and requires far more complex calibration and gain stabilizations efforts than would be compatible with remote, unattended operations. Therefore, this project will construct a composite ÃÂ¿PhoswichÃÂ¿ scintillator by joining a fast plastic scintillator for beta detection to a slow alkali-halide scintillator for gamma-ray detection, and coupling this composite to a single photomultiplier tube. By making background rejection measurements, the performance of the present ARSA could be matched with only a single photomultiplier per sample cell. Phase I will demonstrate feasibility by constructing a model phoswich detector, capturing its output signals when exposed to beta-gamma decay events, and applying off-line digital signal processing to show differentiation between beta-gamma events and pure gamma background events. Different phoswich structures and digital processing algorithms will be investigated to indicate the best approach to Phase II optimization. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The new system should reduce the effort required to install and maintain ARSA operability as part of the US Atomic Energy Detection System (USAEDS). It should greatly enhance national security through the advanced detection of nuclear proliferation activities well before they reach the deliverable weapons stage. In addition, the beta-gamma phoswich coincidence concept could provide a new approach for identifying specific radionuclides in monitoring environmental radiation and or for providing first response capability in nuclear spill or dirty bomb scenarios."

Therefore, ultra-low alphaÃÂ¿particle emitting materials are critical to future development in both these areas. A major problem hindering the development of these materials is the lack of suitable instrumentation to characterize them. The critical issue is that the materials used in the alphaÃÂ¿particle counters also contain these same natural alphaÃÂ¿emitters, and their presence sets background levels that prevent the counter from measuring materials with significantly lower activity than the counter itself. It is difficult and expensive to construct counters of ultra-low activity materials, which are unfortunately prone to contamination. This project will employ digital signal processing and pulse shape discrimination to determine whether counted alphaÃÂ¿particles were emitted from the sample or from counter construction materials. By reducing detector noise, optimizing pulse shape recognition algorithms, and optimizing detector geometry it should be possible to achieve rejection ratios of 10,000-to-1 between counter-source and sample-source alphaÃÂ¿particles. In Phase I, the geometry and instrumentation of an existing detector will be modified to demonstrate that electronic noise levels can be reduced by an order of magnitude. Using the modified detector, data will then be collected to demonstrate the aforementioned rejection ratios. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Potential commercial applications include: (1) support for government research programs, such as rare particle detection, that require ultra-low background materials; (2) instruments for monitoring environmental pollution, where there is interest in measuring the alpha activity of very low level samples; and (3) the semiconductor industry, which has targeted requirements for ultra-low alpha activity level materials for next generation, package-free mounting schemes ÃÂ¿ because alphaÃÂ¿particles introduce ÃÂ¿soft errorsÃÂ¿ into both large memories and processors."

We have existing technology that can handle the raw count rates, but not with the desired spectral quality. We propose to develop the processing algorithms necessary to produce a clean spectrum under extremely high count rate conditions. In addition, since one of the main target applications for this technology is high speed x-ray full spectrum mapping, we will develop algorithms to properly handle the assignment of x-rays to pixels as well as to apply individual deadtime corrections to each pixel.

The presentresearch proposes to develop an alternative detector based on electron multiplication technology.Although electron multipliers are very low noise amplifiers and are capable of very high counting rates,presently available scintillator-photomultiplier (PMT) detectors are not competitive with semiconductorEDDs due to their extremely poor energy resolution, which arises from statistical fluctuations in theinefficient conversion between x-rays and electrons for amplification by the PMT. We are thereforegoing to investigate a novel technology for increasing the efficiency of the conversion process. Initialcalculations suggest that if this conversion process can be made to work close to its theoreticalefficiency, it would be possible to construct detectors having energy resolution superior to semiconduc-tor EDDs for energies below 4 keV and capable of throughputs in excess of 106 counts/sec.

This will remove the single biggest technology barrier to growth of the industrial Internet of Things (IoT), namely the difficulty of installing and maintaining large numbers of wireless sensors in locations that need them. Wireless IoT systems, such as for safety monitoring, performance optimization, or predictive maintenance, can significantly increase productivity, efficiency, safety, and cost reduction of operations. This project's developments in electromechanical design, circuit design, and integrated manufacturing will advance the art of ambient energy harvesting technology. These perpetual energy products will help the United States take global leadership in IoT, providing significant economic benefit to the companies that use this technology for their IoT applications. Successful deployment of IoT directly translates into economic growth, increased worker safety, improved environment, and job creation. The proposed project will develop and manufacture small, inexpensive energy harvesters with built in energy storage for wireless IoT applications. These energy harvesting units will extract energy from ambient sources, such as vibrations, and will provide electrical power for small autonomous IoT devices. The units will feature on-board energy storage, providing power even if the ambient energy source is intermittent or if surge power is temporarily needed. The first units will be optimized for efficiently extracting electrical power from small amplitude vibrations at low frequencies, and can be manufactured at low cost. The same underlying technology can be used to extract energy from other sources, such as air/water flow, mechanical movement, or thermal gradients. The project leverages unique circuit designs and manufacturing processes that enable this unit to be (1) easily integrated into existing electronic systems, (2) efficient in extracting electrical power from low energy sources, and (3) manufacturable at an affordable, market-driven cost.

This offers the opportunity to produce small sensors and devices in remote locations that can collect information, monitor conditions, and transmit data without the need to replace batteries. Small batteries are unsuitable for electronics that are remotely deployed, driving interest to harvest electrical energy directly from the movement and vibration of machinery. Currently, energy harvesting is too large, expensive, and inefficient for practical deployment. If energy harvesting can be made small and inexpensive, it can enable a large suite of products and services for industrial, civil, and agricultural remote monitoring. This project offers the potential to bring energy harvesting to electronics in a way that allows highly efficient energy conversion from vibrating or moving machinery, while maintaining small size and low cost. The ability to embed tiny moving parts directly within printed circuits is highly innovative, and dynamic energy harvesting is an excellent application of this technology. The patented manufacturing processes can be performed using domestic electronics manufacturing infrastructure helping to bring next-generation manufacturing to the U.S. The proposed project seeks to demonstrate a new way to embed dynamic energy harvesting devices directly within printed circuit boards, enabling micro energy production at low cost and small size. The project builds on patented manufacturing processes that leverages conventional electronics manufacturing infrastructure?devices can be built having feature sizes in microns without the need for expensive silicon fabrication foundries. The project will explore designs and fabrication processes for small, efficient vibrating units, culminating in the production of multiple devices in a single small footprint circuit board. Significant effort will be on the development of small, efficient vibrating units that can be manufactured cheaply and in large quantities, yet embedded directly within printed circuits. Three manufacturing rounds are anticipated, producing real devices that can be experimentally tested and measured. The successful completion of this project will demonstrate electrical energy production in a small printed circuit board (approximately the size of a credit card), targeting 100 microwatts to power sensing and telemetry electronics."

Our approach to reaching this objective is to fabricate a CNT-based field emission triode with wedge shaped cathode that can operate in the 70-76 GHz and 81-86 GHz frequency ranges. All the electrodes comprising the device are made in a single plane and where the electrons emit laterally parallel to the substrate. The main advantage of this innovative lateral field emission triode is simple and controllable manufacturing. In vertically oriented field emitter designs there is a requirement to make multiple masks and layers to fabricate the layers of anode, gate, cathode, and the insulator in-between each layer. The cost of fabrication and the difficulties of precisely controlling the vertical gaps and openings make this approach prohibitive for commercial manufacturing. With a planar electrode design a single mask can be used to lithographically make the all the electrodes (anode, cathode, and gates) at once. In addition, using lithography the electrode gaps can be fabricated with great precision and in a highly scalable manner. BENEFIT: Vacuum nanoelectronic devices resulting from the project will be commercialized as new products targeted for entry into important military and commercial markets for power electronics. Electronic warfare applications include amplification of incoming signals from enemy radar or communications systems to enable threat-protection systems for ships, aircraft and high-value land assets, active decoys such as airborne repeaters and high-power off-board decoys for protecting naval assets, and non-lethal weapons operating at long range with minimal risk of injury. Military communications systems, including satellite communications, will benefit from the radiation and temperature insensitivity of vacuum nanoelectronic devices. Communications also represents one of the largest commercial markets for power amplifiers, driven by rapid growth of RF power amplifier and transceiver components as a result of current and anticipated demand for wireless handsets and infrastructure."

Success with the proposed research will enable production of CNT-based electrical probes that overcome long-standing problems with commercially available tips, which are not adequate for advanced electrical profiling applications. Since resolution and contrast of topographic and electrical properties are both dictated by tip geometry and composition, new higher resolution probe tips must be developed. Specifically, metal-coated silicon tips utilized for atomic force microscope (AFM)-based electrical measurements rapidly wear out during operation and their quality and performance cannot be assessed during the measurement. Additionally, commercially conductive AFM tips generally have larger tip diameters, which limit the resolution of the measurement to hundreds of nanometers. The targeted spatial resolution for these conductive CNT probes is in the 1-10 nanometer range required for advanced applications. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be realized in the form of new commercial products already in demand for industrial and scientific applications, including applications in the semiconductor industry. Conductive shielded CNT probes enabled by the project will meet an urgent need within the semiconductor industry for ultra-high resolution electrical measurements. SEMATECH has
underscored this need by supporting research and development of this technology, in anticipation of use by their member companies. Electrically shielded CNT probes will be an enabling technology for making electrical measurements needed in nanoscience and nanotechnology. Example research areas where these devices will find application include materials science (e.g. for electrochemical probing to measure energy storage and conversion at solid-liquid interfaces or for electromechanical energy conversion research for supercapacitor development), biology, medical research, and forensics.

Analysis and preliminary experiments show that an EDLC incorporating the CNT forest electrodes we envision will be capable of providing gravimetric capacitance in the range 200-300 F/g, and energy density in the range 10-100 Wh/kg. The projected energy density will be of particular significance when realized in practice. This is because the energy density range that appears feasible with our design is roughly the same as that typically associated with batteries but unattainable by capacitors. The innovative electrode architecture is also able to provide extraordinarily high areal capacity (measured in Farads per unit device area), which is the energy density performance metric most applicable to power systems for mobile
consumer electronics and power management in MEMS and NEMS based devices. Market opportunities in mobile electronics will be targeted where high performance ultracapacitors are needed to provide pulse power support. Applications will then expand to battery replacement as the technology matures. The company's extensive experience with nanodevice fabrication will also be leveraged by targeting applications involving energy storage and power management in MEMS and NEMS scale devices. Applications of this kind are extremely attractive since they will support premium pricing and will be compatible with our use of lithographic patterning for key manufacturing steps. New applications will be targeted as devices become smaller and more specialized, such as in consumer electronics, implantable medical devices, MEMS and NEMS devices, or next-generation spacecraft, for example, where improving the performance of the power source is crucial. With the continuing trend among electronic device manufacturers to increase the power of their products while continuing to scale down product size, the ultracapacitor market should be poised for dramatic growth."

The central goal of this work is to investigate optimal chemistries and electron beam parameters that will result in the efficient and precise selective etching of carbon nanotubes.This STTR project will result in a simple, effective, and damage-free way of controlling the fabrication and repair of these CNT based nanodevices and for general materials manipulation on the nanosize level. The resulting process yield and product quality improvements will enable larger scale production of CNT AFM tips and CNT emitters as well as other new products we plan to develop for future markets. This research will also enable the development of other carbon nanotube based devices. These include CNT-based X-ray sources for semiconductor metrology, X-ray, microwave and Terahertz-ray sources.

All of these applications require improved electron beam micro-characterization, especially improvements in the spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and processing speed of these imaging tools. These requirements can be met by improving either the electron optical column or the electron source. Although electron optical columns have improved significantly in the last 10-15 years, the field emission source itself has remained basically unchanged. Therefore, this project will demonstrate the utility of nano-sized, high-aspect-ratio, cylindrical, carbon-nanotube (CNT) field emitters for Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEMs) and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopes (TEMs). These CNT field emitters will offer high brightness, low energy spread, small emitter size, high emission stability, long emitter lifetime, and suitability for commercial fabrication . Phase I will design optimal carbon nanotube (CNT) field emitters with geometries for use with scanning electron beam instruments; demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating carbon nanotube field emitters on metal substrates (wires) that can be integrated into SEM and TEM guns; and demonstrate field emission figures-of-merit for the CNT field emitters.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Carbon nanotube field emitters on metal substrates (wires), which can be integrated into SEM and TEM electron guns, would provide improved resolution performance in materials science, biology, medical research, and forensics."

The flexible tip AFM mode will enable the semiconductor industry community to access and image both sidewalls and depths of high aspect features. Tips designed to implement the new imaging mode will enable customers to use carbon nanotubes to image high aspect ratio trenches, contact holes and vias without the sidewall sticking problem that occurs when carbon nanotube tips are used with existing AFMs. Both non contact and contact mode operation will be investigated as well as tip characterization, needed for metrology applications and vertical operation, needed to measure and image feature bottoms, tops and corners. The new AFM imaging mode leverages existing, patented carbon nanotube growth process which are now being used to fabricate carbon nanotubes directly on the apexes of AFM tips for use by semiconductor industry manufacturers.Commercially, introduction of a flexible tip scanning mode innovation has the potential to expand the usefulness of carbon nanotubes as AFM tips beyond the semiconductor industry. AFM users in biology, medicine, materials science, forensics and other fields have increasing needs to image three dimensional structures.

The proposed device will achieve high-precision, high-sensitivity measurement of the magnetic force using the. high-Q mode of multiple torsional oscillators fabricated from silicon as the sensing element. The UT Austin research group has already attained the spatial resolution required for single proton imaging by abandoning inductive detection schemes (NMR pickup coils, etc.) in favor of the multiple torsional oscillator system. This is the only group known to be actively pursuing magnetic resonance force microscopy with this approach. A factor of 100,000 improvement in signal-to-noise has been demonstrated in the laboratory. We now propose to extend the technique to its ultimate goal: single proton imaging. The target magnetic moment sensitivity of 2 x 10-28 J/T will easily permit single proton imaging (Mproton = 1.4 x 10-26 JIT) . The achievement will be demonstrated by non- intrusive detection of individual hydrogen atoms on surfaces. The demonstration of oscillators with a force sensitivity of Fmin =5x 10-16 N at room temperature and 2 x 10-19 N at 4 K, will be considered a complete Phase I success.

This fundamental restriction greatly limits human being's capability of perceiving and understanding the complexity of real world objects and high dimensional data. Uses of true 3D displays in biomedical research would lead to efficient, effective and accurate visualization and interaction on high dimensional cell structure, molecular, genomic medicine, and image data. Uses of true 3D display to clinical applications, such as image guided radiation therapy (IGRT), could eliminate the directional bias during the diagnosis, planning and interventions. Other examples of 3D applications include ophthalmology, endoscopy, bio-analysis, microscopy, and robotic surgeries. There are three classes of true 3D display technologies, namely multiview, volumetric, and computer generated hologram (CGH) displays. This SBIR project deals with multiview 3D display. Many multiview 3D display systems were developed, but all uses multi projectors. These systems could produce impressive visual results, BUT they are very expensive due to costs of multiple (up to256) projectors. Xigen team takes an entirely new approach to the multiview 3D display design. Instead of relying on multiple projectors, we use single projector and clever opto-mechanical scanning mechanism to produce multiple virtual projectors for generating multiviews. This revolutionary single projector multiview (SPM) technique promises to reduce cost and complexity of a 3D display to a level comparable with that of existing 2D display. There are many technical challenges in the SPM design and implementation. We are not able to address all the technical issues in a single SBIR project. Instead, in this SBIR, we will focus on a criticl technical challenge for the SPM display, namely the high-frame-rate (HFR) image projector. To achieve high degree of 3D fidelity, large number of views is needed, requiring HFR. For example, at a standard 24Hz of 3D image refreshing rate, a sequential 128-view 3D display would need 128x24=3,072 Hz grey-scale (8-bit) images. To the best of our knowledge, no single projector exists that can achieve such a HFR, at any cost. Therefore, the primary objective of this SBIR proposed herein is to develop the novel HFR projector technology to facilitate the full color HFR multiview 3D display. Phase 1 specific aims are: Aim 1: Design and test a single color high frame rage (HFR) projector 1.1. Design intensity filter wheel (IFW) and explore electronic control technique for LIM. 1.2. Synchronize LIM with DLP's timing to produce 8-bit grey scale image. Aim 2: Design a full-color (24-bit) HFR projector 2.1. Select light source. 2.2. Design the TIR prism and projection optics. 2.3. Integrate three-chip DLPs into the assembly, alignment etc. Aim 3: Build a prototype of the HFR full-color projector 3.1. HFR projector integration.3.2. Perform tests and evaluations on the prototype. Aim 4: Integrate HFR projector into a multiview 3D display testbed for evaluation 4.1. Integrate the HFR projector into a multiview 3D display testbed available at Xigen. 4.2. Preliminary evaluation of 3D display for clinical applications, prepare Phase 2 plan. HFR projector is a platform technology that can benefit other types of 3D displays as well: both volumetric and holographic 3D display requires HFR projector to achieve high resolution full color 3D display. Thus the success of this SBIR would significantly advance the state-of-the-art of the entire true 3D display field. The true 3D display is a fundamentally new technology platform that facilitates a broad range 3D/4D visualization applications in biomedical research and clinical applications. With the high performance (24-bit full-color with over 3,072Hz frame rate) and low-cost solution proposed in this SBIR, the true 3D display technology could serve as a viable tools to provide a new levelof realism and add a new dimension (literally and figuratively) to the visualization tool available for biomedical research and clinical practices. It has broad impact on various aspects of healthcare practices, ranging from 3D/4D image visualization, image guided intervention, telemedicine, surgical replays, microscope/endoscope visualization, education, training, etc. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE True 3D display is considered as the Holy Grail solution to 3D visualization that can overcome the major limitations of 2D displays. The quest to produce high quality and cost effective 3D displays has continued for decades. In all three major technology categories (light-field, volumetric, and computer generated hologram (CGH) displays), high frame rate (HFR) projectors play a critical role in facilitating 3D image generation. However, the performance requirements (gt 3,000Hz grey-scale image projection) for HFR projection engine by true 3D display systems are quite stringent, beyond any product commercially available today, at any cost.

The proposed 3D-SFE will be able to provide, for the first time, dense 3D XYZ surface data that is co-registered with its 2D RGB counterpart, making 3D imaging an inherent part of SFE imaging capability without requiring users to perform any special manipulations or to take multiple images. The novel 3D imaging capability would greatly enhance the functionality of the existing SFE and enable it to perform, with its miniature probe size of 1~2 mm in diameter, a broad range of minimally invasive surgery procedures that were previously impossible to do. Unique features of the proposed novel 3D-SFE are: 7 High resolution full color 2D video image; 7 Unprecedented 3D imaging capability, with simultaneous and co-registered 2D and 3D image acquisition, possibly at video rate; 7 Single fiber scanner to generate stereo 3D images. 7 Dynamically adjustable field of view and image resolution; 7 Miniature size of the endoscope (~1 mm in diameter); 7 Extreme flexibility; and 7 Powerful 2D/3D image processing capability for minimally invasive surgeries.Xigen LLC proposes this comprehensive SBIR project, based on our strong collaborations and partnership with leading researchers/clinicians in multiple universities and hospitals. The Xigen team has long history and proven experience of attacking significant yet difficult 3D imaging problems in biomedical applications. Working closely with the research and clinical teams at the University of Washington who have developed multiple versions of working 2D scanning fiber endoscopes, we will develop full scale design, algorithms, hardware, software, and packaging for the 3D-SFE system, making it an integrated endoscopic image-guided system for minimally invasive surgeries that can access many sites that is currently impossible for existing endoscopes to do due toits ultra-thin diameter. This SBIR support will support thorough optical design, opto-electro-mechanical engineering development, 3D algorithmic development, and extensive tests. In Phase 1, the feasibility of the novel 3D-SFE will be thoroughly investigated. In Phase 2, working closely with clinical experts on our team, we will develop two fully functional 3D-SFE systems. We have streamlined our clinical study plan and focused on using 3D surface imaging capability for minimally invasive surgeries, such as otolaryngology surgeries (access sinus, middle ear, inner ear and skull based surgeries), and eye surgeries and drug placement on optic nerves. Proprietary Information of XIGEN LLC. 0 NIH SBIR PAR-09-220PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Minimally invasivesurgeries (MIS) are procedures in which devices are inserted into the body through natural openings or small skin incisions to diagnose and treat/repair a wide range of medical conditions as an alternative to traditional open surgeries. Minimally invasivesurgery has achieved pre-eminence for many general surgery procedures over the last two decades and has lead to reduced risk of complications, faster recovery with enhanced patient satisfaction due to reduced postoperative pain and favorable health systemeconomics. Examples of minimally invasive procedures include: otolaryngology surgeries (access sinus, middle ear, inner ear and skull based surgeries), eye surgeries and drug placement on optic nerves, interventional cardiology procedures of balloon angioplasty and stenting; arthroscopic procedures, including knee, shoulder, small joint and hips; and laparoscopic procedures to examine, diagnose and treat problems of the abdomen. However, traditional endoscopes have many shortcomings in performing MIS: 7Large Diameter of conventional endoscopes (4-13 mm) limits access regions where they can be used; 7 Limited Flexibility of current devices also prevents them from use in confined spaces; 7 Inadequate image quality of conventional endoscopes with small diameter to perform diagnosis or surgical interventions. 7 High Costs of high-resolution fiber bundle endoscopes as well as video-chip endoscopes; 7 Lack of 3D imaging capability, which is especially useful for sizing, diagnosis, registration of pre- operative and intra-operative images, and agile manipulation of instruments in confined spaces when conducting surgeries. Simultaneous 2D and 3D imaging capability would be useful in minimally invasive procedures, which require precise manipulation of multiple instruments. In addition, a method for accurate, real-time registration of endoscopic images with 3D data from CT and MRI images would be a significant advance in endoscopic interventions. Conventional video endoscopes (including the existing SFEs) acquire 2D images without the depth information that is needed for accurate registration with 3D pre-operative data. The ideal solution would be to acquire 3D images directly with the endoscope itself in real-time. 3D images can also enhance the endoscopist's visual feedback for manipulating and positioning the endoscope. Precise and quantitative sizing and 3D measurements are also crucial for surgical interventions. Additionally, the 3D surface from endoscopy optionally registered with CT and/or MR data would provide the endoscopist with better accuracy and more information for making decisions and performing minimally invasive procedures. The primary objective of this SBIR, therefore, is to develop and demonstrate a novel 3D imaging approach, specifically designed for the ultrathin scanning fiber endoscope (SFE) that enables unprecedented simultaneous 2D and 3D surface imaging capability. With pressing needs for effective endoscopic tools for minimally invasive surgeries, and multi-billion dollars spent every year world-wide in the MIS technologies, a practical, ultrathin, and low-cost 3D endoscope with high resolution, larger field of view (FOV), and unprecedented 2D and 3D imaging capability has a great potential for widespread medical and industrial applications."

This fundamental restriction greatly limits the capability of human being in perceiving and understanding the complexity of real world objects. Human body and internal organs are of 3D shapes. Many medical imaging modalities are true 3D in nature. 3D imaging and 4D real-time imaging modalities have proven especially useful in cancer diagnosis and treatments, such as image guided radiation therapy (IGRT). However, when 3D image data are collected, existing methods of image display, interpretation and evaluation are often 2D, leading to possible slowdown,misinterpretation and less desirable clinical decisions for diagnosis, IGRT and other 3D visualization tasks. Xigen LLC has recently made a technology breakthrough and developed a novel large screen autostereoscopic 3D display concept based on the novel Single Projector Multiview (SPM) technology. The proposed SPM 3D display technology enables scalable large screen (up to a few meters), glass-free, interactive 3D visualization experience, and could alleviate key drawbacks of existing 3D display technologies by providing stereo parallax, motion parallax and surface textures, and reducing overall system cost to the range comparable with 2D display counterparts. Using only one projector significantly reduces the complexity, cost, and burdens for calibration and maintenance, resulting in a low-cost, high quality, mass-produciable commercial product. Uses of true 3D display in biomedical research would lead to efficient, effective and accurate visualization and interaction on high dimensional cell structure, molecular, genomic medicine, and image data. Uses of true 3D display to clinical applications, such as image guided radiation therapy (IGRT), could eliminate the directional bias during the diagnosis, planning and interventions. To the best of our knowledge,the proposed SPM 3D display concept is unprecedented and represents a significant breakthrough in true 3D display technology. The primary objective of this Phase I SBIR effort is to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel SPM technology by developing critical components for the SPM system, building a functional prototype, and demonstrating its application potential to various 3D/4D visualization applications in clinical settings with a focus on image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). This project would bring the novel true 3D display technology one important step closer to marketplace as a generic tool for advanced 3D visualization for biomedical research and cancer diagnosis/treatments.

CBCT can provide volumetric 3D/4D images of patients anatomy prior to an IGRT session. However, due to acquisition speed and radiation exposure, CBCT is not suitable for continuous use in real-time patient monitoring. In contrast, optical 3D surface imaging can be performedin-vivo and continuously without any ionizing radiation. It however is not able to provide internal anatomy information. The innovative approach proposed herein inherits advantages of both the CBCT and the optical 3D surface imaging, while alleviating drawbacks of both. It promises to provide viable in-vivo solution to IGRT for significantly reducing errors in all three stages of radiation therapy (RT): (1) treatment planning; (2) patient setup for treatment; and (3) adaptation to inter-fractional anatomicchanges and intra-fractional movement.

Difficulty in verifying a cleared range causes significant launch delay that may significantly affect the operation safety, cost and schedule. With the increase of workload on existing and/or newly-built spaceports, challenges in launch range clearance and surveillance call for new breakthrough in technologies to better serve for NASA's missions.
We propose this SBIR to develop a novel ""Smart Pan/Tilt/Zoom Visible/IR Sensor"" platform, dubbed Smart PTZ(TM), especially suited for detection, tracking, recognition, and identification of persons and objects that have intruded areas of the range that must be cleared in order to conduct safe launch operations.
Conventional optical sensors have limited field of views (FOV). They observe objects through a small solid angle. Simultaneous acquisition of target in panoramic view is not possible. Although optical amplification may provide detailed target image, detecting and tracking target(s) in a large area is difficult, resulting in lengthy search time, costly UAV maneuvers, low efficiency in verifying range clearance, even missing intruder due to limited FOV. Increasing FOV, however, is a double-edged sword that leads to a decreased spatial resolution, causing difficulties in target recognition and classification.
To resolve the simultaneous yet contradicting requirements on the FOV and image resolution for range surveillance applications, we propose a novel Smart PTZ sensor concept that meets both needs with unprecedented performance. By integrating both wide FOV sensor and agile PTZ sensor within a compact package, together with a set of intelligent video analysis algorithms, the Smart PTZ sensor would enable high performance target detection, tracking, recognition and classification, within a very large FOV (up to 360-degree) for NASA launch range clearance and surveillance."

Difficulty in verifying a
cleared range causes significant launch delay that may significantly affect the operation safety, cost and schedule.
We propose this SBIR to develop a novel ""Smart Pan/Tilt/Zoom Visible/IR Sensor"" platform, especially suited for detection, tracking,
recognition, and identification of persons and objects that have intruded areas of the range that must be cleared in order to conduct safe
launch operations.
Conventional optical sensors have limited field of views (FOV). They observe objects through a small solid angle subtended in front of the
sensor. Although the high optical amplification may provide high resolution image of a target, detecting and tracking potential target within a
large area is difficult, resulting in lengthy search time, costly UAV maneuvers, low efficiency of verifying range clearance, even missing
intruded target due to limited FOV. Increasing FOV, however, is a double-edged sword that, for any given sensor, leads to a decreased spatial
resolution, causing difficulties in target recognition and classification.
To address these contradicting requirements on FOV and resolution for range surveillance applications, we propose a novel Smart PTZ
sensor concept with the following unique advantages:
(1)Novel optical design of wide FOV optics, no blind spot, no image distortion;
(2)Simultaneous wide FOV and zoomed high resolution images;
(3)Smart PTZ target tracking;
(4)Intelligent video analysis algorithms for automatic target detection and tracking;
(5)Embedded on-board DSP processing module;
(6)Novel optical design applies to both visible and infrared sensors;
(7)Flexible mounting options: on-board UAV, land vehicle mounted, and fixed camera."

GI tract disorders are easy to cure in their early stages but are difficult to diagnose. Common exam procedures, such as endoscopy, are often not adequate and reliable. Supposedly, endoscopy is to exam the walls of the digestive tract. However, existing endoscopes are design to have a limited forward-looking field-of-view (FOV). Even with a side window to view a portion of GI tract walls, a 360 panoramic view cannot be obtained simultaneously. Subsequently, limited FOV and lack of ability to see 360 surrounding areas may lead to significant discomfort or potential damage to patients due to the need for turning entire endoscope to look around , and lead to undesirable consequence of missing potential sites of disorders, e.g. hiatal hernia, gastritis, ulcers, polyps, stomach/colon cancer. This SBIR project develops a novel 360 capsule camera, dubbed the Neo360 CapsuleTM, which provides a simultaneous panoramic 360 field of view (FOV) using optical unwrapping, instead of digital unwrapping. Xigen's proprietary Neo360 imaging technology can provide 70% more image resolution than conventional endoscopes, and employs no moving parts. Not only can it acquire 360 video of interior walls of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but also such 360 video images can be viewed directly, for the first time, without need of external computational hardware/software for unwrapping. The proposed Neo360 Capsule would provide endoscopists with greatly enhanced imaging performance that could eliminate certain miss-diagnosis of disease during GI exams. The directly viewable 360 video would also enhance visualization and communication in clinical practice. Xigen LLC has successfully completed a Phase I investigation on the Neo360 CapsuleTM design and demonstrated convincingly the feasibility of this novel imaging technology via theoretical analysis, software development, simulation validation, CAD design, prototype fabrication, and bench-top experiments. Phase II program will design and build a functional prototype of the Neo360 CapsuleTM, test the prototype by technologist and clinicians, and pursue various commercial applications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Neo360 CapsuleTM concept blazes an entirely new trail in the 360 imaging technology field. It will greatly increase the efficiency, accuracy, and patient's comfort in GI tract diagnosis and treatment. It will also provide a unique tool for documentation, surgery planning, and training. Due to its simple structural and optical design, the Neo360 CapsuleTM can be manufactured at low cost with high reliability for practical field use environment. The Neo360 imaging technology developed under this SBIR program is a platform technology with widespread commercial potential. As a breakthrough imaging technology, it will lead many researchers and practitioners to rethink the way video images are captured and spawn commercial ventures to bring it to clinical markets. In addition to many medical diagnostic instrument applications, e.g, endoscopes, gastroscope, cystoscope, colonscope, etc., the Neo360 imaging technology will lead to commercial applications in many other areas, such as pipe inspection, turbine engine diagnosis, video surveillance, automotive safety devices, navigation, security, mobile robotics, video conferencing, and internet webcast. Xigen has an integrated product development and market entry strategy. Based upon our extensive market analysis performed during Phase I, we have selected three major vertical markets in which to develop innovative product(s) offering significant value propositions. These three vertical markets are: (1) medical and industrial endoscopes (~ 4.3 billion); (2) video surveillance cameras (~ 13 billion), and (3) automotive safety products, e.g., rearview mirrors and parking sensors, (~ 13.4 billion).

These images are inherently of 3D nature, yet all conventional displays use flat 2D screens that lack important depth cues. While rendering software using 2D display monitors are quite effective in presenting 3D aspects of the imaging modalities, they are often inadequate. This fundamental restriction greatly limits the capability of clinicians to perceive the complexity of the 3D anatomy and treatment plan, therefore affects the safety, speed, accuracy, and effectiveness of the treatment procedures. In contrast to conventional 2D display, the volumetric 3D display we proposed herein possesses a true 3D display volume, and places physically each 3D voxel in the displayed 3D images at the true 3D (x, y, z) spatial position. Each voxel, analogous to a pixel in a 2D image, emits light from that position to form a real 3D image in the eyes of viewers. The volumetric 3D display technology provides both physiological and psychological depth cues to human visual system to perceive 3D objects and is considered as the Holy Grail solution to true 3D visualization of medical image, as well as many other image display problems. For the past ten years, the principal investigator of this SBIR has been working on developing the state-of- the-art volumetric 3D display technologies. Although our previous development achieved a high success, one of the major limitation of this type of volumetric display systems is that its 3D display volume is generated by a large size moving screen that rotates constantly at the speed of 600~1800 RPM. The structure of a moving screen dramatically complicates the design, production, use, and maintenance of the display system, making it very delicate and fragile for daily uses and expensive for widespread adoption for medical image visualizations. Xigen LLC has recently made a technology breakthrough and developed a revolutionary new concept of volumetric 3D display, which totally eliminates any moving screen. The unique advantages of the proposed static screen volumetric 3D display technology include: z No moving screen; z Inherent parallel mechanism for 3D voxel addressing; z High spatial resolution; z Full color display is easy to implement z Fine voxel size (at a sub-millimeter level); z No blind spot on the display volume and the display volume can be of arbitrary shape. z Simple and elegant system structure design; z No special viewing glasses or any special eyewear is needed to view the 3D images; z No image jitter affect that is associated with moving screen; z Low-cost and low-maintenance. We have already performed considerable preliminary feasibility studies to verify the validity of the proposed concept and implementation strategy. We propose this SBIR program to build a high resolution version of prototype hardware and develop associated software platform. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The primary objective of this Phase I SBIR effort is to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel volumetric 3D display concept with the unprecedented static screen high resolution volumetric 3D display capability. We have already performed considerable preliminary feasibility studies to verify the validity of the proposed concept and implementation strategy. We propose this SBIR program to build a high resolution version of prototype hardware and develop associated software platform to demonstrate its application for medical image visualization. The major innovations of this SBIR effort include: z Introduction of the Laser Sub-surface Engraving technology into the dynamic volumetric 3D display; z The voxel column concept that converts the crystal block and a 2D image projection into an addressable dynamic volumetric 3D display device, with a static screen; z The Time Division and Diffraction Wheel concepts that facilitate the ultra-high-resolution image projection from single DMD projection system for the high-resolution volumetric 3D display. Specific aims of our Phase 1 program include: Aim 1: Working with clinical experts to define the 3D Crystal requirements; Aim 2: Design and build a high resolution prototype of the 3D-Crystal screen; Aim 3: Design and build a high resolution image projection engine; Aim 4: Develop image processing and control software for the 3D-Crystal volumetric 3D display system; Aim 5: Perform extensive tests on the volumetric 3D display prototype; Aim 6: Collaborate with imaging experts at Johns Hopkins to demonstrate advantages of volumetric 3D display for medical image visualization; Aim 7: Develop optimal design of clinically-testable version of 3D-Crystal display based on the Phase 1 prototype experience, and prepare for Phase 2 work plan. The Phase 2 follow-on program should afford us with sufficient resources to design, build and test a clinically-testable version of functional high resolution volumetric 3D display. The proposed true 3D display technology adds one more dimension (literally and figuratively) to many medical image visualization applications. It is not meant to replace traditional 2D display and 3D rendering visualization systems, but rather to augment them, giving the viewers the unique power and flexibility to unambiguously visualize 3D complex information. If succeed, this ground breaking effort will have a significant impact on medical research and will revolutionize many current practices in medical image visualization, clinical diagnosis, radiation therapy planning, reconstructive and corrective surgery, medical education, training, and medical research. .

ge sequences while traveling along the gastrointestinal(GI) tract. Although this revolutionary technology offers patients with painless examination experience, it however only provides two dimensional (2D) sequential video images that contains no three dim
ensional (3D) information of observed targets. Recognition and evaluation of pathological structures and the estimation of their spatial dimension can only be achieved by experience, making a diagnosis decision very subjective. For daily clinical usages, t
he unprecedented huge data set (more than 57,600 raw 2D images per exam) requires in average 45 minutes of physician's time to review. Locating the spatial position of a specific target with respect to patient's body is fairly difficult task due to lack of
 3D information. The primary objective of this SBIR program is to develop a 3D image processing computational software platform, dubbed as the Video-to-3DTM , which is able to (automatically) produce, for the first time, an integrated, patient-specific, a
nd quantitatively measurable gastrointestinal (GI) tract 3D model based upon the 2D video sequence acquired by a capsule camera during an exam. The ability to perform quantitatively 3D measurement of pathological structures with calibrated color texture wo
uld make endoscopic diagnosis more objective and reproducible. Furthermore, an integrated 3D model of patient-specific GI tract and 3D fly-through visualization software capability would assist diagnosis and intervention planning, save physicians tremendou
s time in video reviewing, and provide accurate 3D intra-body localization of target of interest with respect to patient's body. Since a capsule camera moves freely inside the GI tract, its 6-degree-of-freedom motion is neither controllable nor accuratel
y measurable. We therefore need to develop sophisticated computational efficient algorithms to obtain a very robust estimation of the camera motion from the uncalibrated image sequence, and then reconstruct 3D structure using the known camera motion and ot
her 3D image processing techniques. The Video-to-3DTM Software Platform is designed to carry out the following tasks: (1) 3D Modeling: Inter-correlate over 57,600 images acquired by any capsule camera to reconstruct a high resolution patient-specific 3D
model of GI tract; (2) 3D Visualization: Provide texture super-resolution and 3D fly-through capability for the 3D GI tract model to help physicians to visualize and diagnose quickly, interactively, accurately, and efficiently; (3) 3D Measurement: Perform
quantitative 3D measurement of interested pathological structures; (4) 3D Localization: Determine accurate 3D intra-body location of targets within patient's body. (5) Computer-aided diagnosis: The ultimate goal of the proposed Video-to3D system is to be a

These patients suffer from severe, diabetes-induced, peripheral, sensory neuropathy and, thus they frequently do not protect their feet from repetitive shear stress or traumatic episodes and ulceration often ensues. We have previously shown that the temperature profile of the plantar aspects of the foot provides a reliable warning of tissue injury and can be effectively used as a preventive modality. In this study we propose to further develop and clinically test a novel infrared-based temperature instrument (MedSkan) that is intended for home use by high-risk diabetic patients. This step-on remote monitoring device will serve as an early warning system for impending ulcers and Charcot fractures. The study's central hypothesis is that the MedSkan device will reduce the incidence of ulcers by providing an accurate, simple, and effective approach to monitor changes in foot temperatures. To study this hypothesis, the following specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: To develop, validate and implement software and protocols for the following: (i) data acquisition and processing, and (ii) the physician-MedSkan communications interface. A state-of-the-art web interface will be developed to allow clinicians to view the stored data for their patients. Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of the MedSkan in reducing the incidence of diabetic foot ulcers among high-risk patients. Our hypothesis is that patients monitored with the MedSkan will have fewer foot ulcers and that the ulcers will be less severe. The 110 patient study will comprise two treatment arms: the standard therapy group and the enhanced therapy group. The latter will receive standard care plus infrared temperature monitoring using the MedSkan daily for 12 months. Elevated temperatures will provide information to the physician that prevention practices should be initiated, such as off-loading, skin care, etc. Aim 3: To determine the normal range of temperature variations for each individual foot for patients in the Enhanced Therapy and to correlate deviations from this range to the incidence of ulcers. Our previous studies have used the contralateral foot as the control to detect abnormal temperatures. We will investigate the hypothesis that with proper trending of normal foot temperatures, the individual foot can serve as its own control for predicting ulcers. Care will be taken to follow all IRB and patient privacy regulations."

The hypothesis is that the HealthScan device will provide an accurate and convenient approach to identify potential foot problems by monitoring dermal temperature changes on the plantar aspect of the foot. Aim 1. To fabricate and validate an infrared based version of the HeaithScan. First - Fabricate an infrared thermometry based HealthScan unit to measure the entire plantar aspect of the foot using a scanning technique. Second - To calibrate/validate the instrument using in vitro standards calibrated against NIST-traceable temperature probes using water baths held at various temperatures. Thereafter, we will verify accurate data transmission by the internal modem of the HealthScan. Aim 2. To examine in-clinic use of the HealthScan by diabetic patients. The HealthScan will be used in-clinic with 40 diabetic patients (20 with elevated temperatures and 20 with normal temperatures). Foot temperatures will be measured and then transmitted to a computer using the device's internal modem. Furthermore, the accuracy of the transmitted temperature data will be compared to a standard dermal thermometer."

To extend this technology to proximity fuses in small to medium caliber munitions and sub-munitions, it is now necessary to develop novel techniques for lower power consumption and further miniaturization by expansion of scale of integration combining RF and signal processing circuits. This proposal describes Hittite's approach to develop a highly integrated chip for the low-power ultra-miniature proximity fuses. The proposed approach is based on Hittite's unique circuit techniques and newly emerging silicon and gallium-arsenide semiconductor processes. The new processes allow operation of silicon MMICs at higher frequencies and integration of signal processing circuits in GaAs, showing a promise of highly integrated multi-function mixed-signal ICs. The proposed program will lead to definition of optimum scale of integration, selection of the optimum process, and demonstration of the feasibility of the low-power ultra-miniature fuses.

Xilectricâs technology seeks to dramatically improve Li-ion abuse tolerance to high temperatures and voltages by better maintaining the Li-ion electrolyte. Our additives improve the capacity retention and rate capabilities of Li-ion batteries. Through this SBIR project, Xilectric will accelerate the development of our additives and begin chemical process development studies needed to bring our materials to the market. Xilectric will also develop tailored derivatives for application to emerging use-case scenarios. For example, high-nickel cathode materials are an important next-generation EV cathode due to their high capacity, rate capability, and low cost. A subset of the development work on this SBIR program will focus on the requirements of emerging high-nickel cathodes. The key to driving down the cost of Li-ion to further promote adoption of the high-value end products such as electric vehicles is to reduce the material input cost of the anodes, cathode, and other materials that comprise the cell. Despite being low-cost, the materials must also present adequate calendar and cycle life for the given product application. Li-ion manufacturers would prefer to use the lowest cost materials, but need to balance cost with customer expectations for high-quality long-lasting batteries.

Besides, this proposed technology can significantly extend the lifespan of current building rooftop materials to reduce the maintenance costs for all industrial and commercial building owners and property managers. In some situations, this proposed rooftop system could have longer life than the buildings themselves, especially when the rooftop systems are installed some years after the buildings were built and put in use. In such situations, due to its completely modularized structure design, this proposed rooftop system could be disassembled into modules from an end-of-life building rooftop, and reassembled/reused in other buildings. Furthermore, this proposed technology uses totally recyclable materials. So, at the real end of its life, the entire building rooftop system can be disassembled into pieces and a hundred percent recycled. Nothing will go to landfill at the end. This is another major environmental benefit of this proposed system.Very importantly, the above-mentioned unparalleled benefits of this proposed technology do not come with high cost. In fact, its cost is lower than current green rooftop technologies in the sense that it can pay itself within two years due to its superior energy efficiency, and its low cost modularized structure design. Users of this technology, including builders, building owners and property managers, etc. will get the money, which they paid for this green rooftop system, back within two years from energy bill savings, maintenance cost reductions, rooftop material life extensions (resulting in lower re-roofing frequency), plus some electricity generation revenues at peak grid hours. In order to keep the system cost low, energy storage is not included. Extra electricity is uploaded to grid. The total domestic market size of this technology can be as large as $197 billion dollars each year, which is equivalent to 1642.3 kilo-watt-hours of electricity annually, on top of all the benefits such as reducing our nation's dependency on fossil fuels and cut down both criteria air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions to protect our environment."

While each has particular advantages and disadvantages, AR systems' designers have to make a choice between these two. This project provides the advantages of both optical and video technologies in a single system, and can be seamlessly transited.

Our approach is to break SINGLE clock network into MULTIPLE clock domains with the identical frequencies and phases. In the proposed clock generators design, the clock frequency for all domains will be kept within a small variation range. Therefore, FIB probing operation needs to keep up with the chip normal operation speed. However, the most advanced probe will increase the loading on the targeting nodes by at least one order of magnitude; the probed nodes will switch much slower than their normal operation speed. Thus a slower clock signal is required in order to get valid data stream from the probing nodes. Since the proposed clocking strategy will not allow clock slow down, the chip under probing can not function properly. The first order estimation shows that the difficulty to overcome this clock strategy increases exponentially with the number of the clock domain increasing. In contrast, the area/power penalty increases linearly with the number of clock domain increasing."

If the islets can be replaced, as with transplantation, then diabetes can be reversed.Human islets have limited utility because of a severe shortage of donors and the need for constant immune suppression to prevent rejection. Pigs could provide an unlimited supply of islets but the rejection would be even more vigorous, necessitating greater immune suppression. Ximerex, Inc. has developed an innovative and proprietary technology known as surrogate tolerogenesis (ST). With ST pig islets can be transplanted without rejection or immune suppression. ST is supported by extensive proof of principle, including pig islets to diabetic monkey transplants with prolonged survival and function without immune suppression. The program was recently reviewed by the NIH commercialization assistance program (CAP). A large panel of experts in business development concluded that the technology does provide a strong competitive advantage and is protected by a robust patent portfolio. However, the regulatory hurdles are substantial, requiring FDA approval for commercialization. Ximerex, Inc. is unlikely to attract private investments until the FDA allows phase I/II trails. Many specific suggestions were made. RFA-OD-09008 (an RC3 BRDG-SPAN pilot program) targets small companies such as Ximerex, Inc. in the  Valley of Death , i.e. with extensive proof ofprinciple but unable to attrac investors. This proposal takes the steps necessary for initial clinical trials and subsequent investment based development. Specifically, it includes a large definitive pig to nonhuman primate transplant study to establish efficacy of ST to the FDA; recruitment of a chief medical officer for planning clinical trials and interacting with the FDA; and development of facilities and labs for the FDA certified swine source herd and tissue processing. Furthermore, this proposal transforms the program from one based on the founder to a multi-institutional partnership, including the University of Miami-Diabetes Research Institute with their wealth of knowledge and facilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While developing our technologies in the field of transplantation, we have measured our progress with both success and failure. Through these trials we have developed a simple idea into what may change our ability to treat disease, putting transplantation of porcine tissues into the limelight.

fectious or pathogenic state in humans or animal models. PERV consists of three viruses: PERV A, PERV B and PERV C. PERV A and PERV C are the primary culprits for transmission to human cell lines. Our program has maintained a herd of very clean pigs for po
tential clinical xenotransplantation. Co-culture tests with liver cells from our pigs failed to pass the virus to human cells. Screening the pigs, they are PERV C negative. The majority are PERV A negative. One pig is negative for all three viruses as well

 be raised under very clean controlled conditions. However, concern has been raised about a virus present in pigs, porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV). PERV is part of the DNA of the pig, so it cannot be eradicated by conventional means. A herd that has b
een maintained by us for clinical xenotransplantation has been found to have very little PERV. One pig appears to be PERV free. This application would produce a PERV free swine herd for clinical xenotransplantation."

For example, the transplantation of islets from human cadaveric donors has reversed type 1
diabetes for many recipients, making them insulin independent. Unfortunately, there are not nearly enough human organ donors to satisfy the need. Only about 0.1% of the 1.5 million Americans with T1D receive an islet transplant each year. Furthermore, they
 must receive chronic immune suppression indefinitely.Pig organs could satisfy this immense unmet need. They can be produced under controlled very clean conditions in a cost effective manner. The physiology is very similar to that of humans. The primar
y obstacle to xenotransplantation, however, is the vigorous rejection of pig tissues.Ximerex has developed a technology for avoiding the need for immune suppression. Recipient cells are grown within the donor pig, during fetal development. Later, the c
himeric lymphocytes and tissue graft are transplanted back into the recipient. Observations have shown prolonged function of pig islet tissue in diabetic monkeys without immune suppression.The proposal will transform this promising phenomenon into a xe
notransplantation system for application in the clinic. The regulatory cells in the chimeric pig will be identified and quantified. A program for bioproduction and purification of the responsible regulatory cells will be developed. The system will be teste
d with marrow specimens from human subjects with T1D, where a deficiency of T regulatory cells may contribute to the autoimmune destruction of beta cells.The lessons from the proposed studies would substantially enhance the likelihood that preclinical
trials and clinical trials will have successful outcomes.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Type I diabetes (T1D) is due to loss of insulin producing beta cells and effects more than 1.25 million Americans. Ximerex is developing an unlimited source of replaceme

Typical transplant survivals are more than 10 years. Because of an acute shortage of human donors, however, most do not receive their needed heart graft. Whereas approximately 2300 transplants are performed annually in the United States, it has been estimated that 50,000 could benefit, if a donor were available. In the developed world, the unmet need is estimated at 135,000 transplants per year. The use of donor pigs could readily resolve this severe shortage of organ donors. Pigs can be raised under very clean conditions and would eliminate the risk of spreading human infections and tumors. The physiology of the pig heart is also very similar to human hearts. However, pig heart xenografts are vigorously rejected. With conventional and transgenic donor pigs, increased immune suppression is required to prolong graft survival. This has raised concern about transmission of zoonotic infections to the recipient. The problem is that multiple immune reactions by the host against multiple xenoantigens destroy the graft.  Ximerex, Inc. has developed proprietary technology that prevents acute xenograft rejection, including acute vascular rejection, without the need for severe immune suppression. By growing the recipient lymphocytes within donor fetal pigs, the goals of transplantation, specific immune tolerance to the pig and accommodation of the pig tissues, are achieved within the donor animal, before transplantation. Ximerex would process and grow the patient's marrow cells in the donor pig and provide chimeric spleen lymphocytes and an accommodated donor heart to the transplant center. The value of chimeric donor pigs has been demonstrated with pig to sheep heart transplants, including transplants into sensitized sheep with preformed anti-pig antibodies. With modest immune suppression, prolonged graft survival was observed. Furthermore, prolonged survival of pig islets (>150 days) in rhesus macaques was achieved without any post-transplant immune suppression. Heart explants from chimeric pigs demonstrate accommodation with protection against antibodies and complement, including fresh human blood. RNA for proteins associated with accommodation is upregulated in the heart tissue.The proposed SBIR project would complete the preclinical studies required for FDA allowance of phase I/II clinical trials. The Phase I SBIR proposal would establish in pilot studies the efficacy of transplanting chimeric donor pig hearts into non-human primates with hide or no immune suppression. Follow up studies would establish the relative contribution of tissue accommodation and specific immune tolerance to the prolongation of heart xenograft survival."

Each year, an estimated 530,000 adults die of cardiac arrest in the USA. Mortality rates are excessively high â
90% for out-of-hospital events and 75% for in-hospital events â and have remained mostly unchanged for over
a decade. We can and should do better. In their 2020 Guidelines, the American Heart Association (AHA) states
that early high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the most critical lifesaving intervention for a patient
in cardiac arrest. However, delivering high-quality chest compressions is difficult even for well-trained rescuers.
High-quality CPR is built on robust regular training and performance-focused debriefing. However, most rescuers
still train just once every two years. Though AHA has launched initiatives for more frequent training, the CPR
aids that are used in training still do not accompany the rescuer during clinical responses. Ultimately, rescuers
either rely solely on their memory, or use current defibrillator-based CPR aids that have questionable benefit in
improving CPR quality. In addition, performance data remains buried in defibrillators and are not routinely used
for peer quality reviews; thus, there is no way to measure if the current training initiatives are improving CPR
quality. There is a need for highly functioning point-of-care tools to assist practitioners during a cardiac arrest
response, as well as tools that allow for regular training in in-situ settings and provide data-rich performance-
focused peer debriefing. XiMiO Health, Inc. proposes to develop the first smartwatch-enabled Basic Life Support
(BLS) application for use both in training and clinical response. We will design the BLS App with real-time
decision support to AHA protocols and real-time CPR depth and rate performance feedback, enabling a rescuer
to be immediately ready to provide high-quality CPR in an emergency. By linking the BLS App to a real-time
cloud-based network, we will enable teams to train together and respond to codes together. Lastly, a cloud-
based secure database will allow for peer debriefing andamp; reviews, meaning rescuers can track their performance
improvements. In Phase I, we will first develop a fully functional prototype of the BLS App. We will then conduct
an IRB-approved feasibility study using CPR manikins to establish proof-of-concept of the BLS Appâs
performance and utility as a CPR aid. The study will enroll 30 adult participants across three user groups: in-
hospital BLS-certified healthcare professionals, out-of-hospital BLS-certified first responders (e.g., EMTs), and
noncertified personnel. Upon successfully reaching proof-of-concept, Phase II will include development and
design verification testing of the BLS App under Design Controls, followed by FDA 510(k) clearance of the BLS
App and development of subsequent apps and functionality to achieve our principal mission of a cloud-based
network of interconnected smartwatch applications for cardiac arrest quality improvement. Our overarching
hypothesis is that rescuers and organizations will improve their CPR quality, and ultimately, survival rates by
implementing a continuous quality improvement system enabled by our interactive wearable technology.Project Narrative
Early high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the most critical lifesaving intervention for a patient in
cardiac arrest. However, CPR quality remains low because most rescuers train only once every two years and
with performance aids that do not accompany them during clinical responses. In this SBIR project, XiMiO Health,
Inc. proposes to develop a network of smartwatch-enabled applications to improve CPR quality by providing
real-time CPR guidance during clinical responses, accessible tools for regular training, and data-rich debriefing."

Xinetics proposes a Programmable Relaxor Open-Loop Mirror using Integrated Spatial Encoders (PROMISE) that combines surface parallel actuation and micro optical encoders. The programmable relaxor open-loop mirror uses a surface parallel actuator array, made using ferroelectric micromachining originally developed for silicon based MEMS. The programmable actuator array enables the dimensionally stability and angstrom level control provided only by relaxor ferroelectrics, as has been demonstrated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The integrated spatial encoder features an optical encoder that monitors dimensional change and is integrated directly between the actuator array and the surface mount interconnect. The voltage output of the optical encoder is used as a direct input to the feedback loop for the actuator circuit enabling electroactive control of the mirror surface without the necessity of an optical sensor, thereby enabling open loop control."

This is just a matter of the statistics of turbulence. However, todaythere are many scenarios where this basic assumption doesn't hold true. Scenarios with high scintillation, turbulence that doesn't satisfy standard statistics, or systems that contain high frequency jitter, need a system that can generate large amounts ofstroke at high frequency. New deformable mirrors must be developed that can handle these high current reuqirements without damaging the ceramic actuators used in today's mirrors. In addition, the need to make smaller optical systems while retaining thesame large number of degrees of freedom further complicates the issue.  Xinetics proposes to build a new type of deformable mirror that will address both of these issues. The mirror will utilize new understanding on actuator technology to insure that theactuator can operate to high frequencies at full stroke. In addition, the mirror will use a new modular mirror technology that permits much more compact and efficient mirror designs and robotic technology to aid in the assembly process"

Efforts to increase the flexibility of these systems are focused on redesigning the driver and controlelectronics. The technology that will permit the design of compact systems will include significant simplification or elimination of cabling and interconnect hardware, the reduction of driver volume by an order of magnitude, and a decrease in quiescentpower to effectively minimize power consumption and thermally induced optical errors.Xinetics proposes to create a new paradigm for airborne adaptive optics systems through an innovative driver system designed to address immediate and future needs. This system will utilize an advanced switching technology applied in conjunction to aninnovative trickle charging system. Specifically, the implementation of this approach will reduce the power consumption of a 256 actuator DM system from 1 kW to 100 W, the quiescent power from 751 W to 75 W, and the weight from 340 lbs. to 30 lbs. Theresulting system will enable the driver system to be located behind the current ABL deformable mirror facesheet, while avoiding thermally induced optical errors due to the extremely low quiescent power. Low noise, high-density multiplexed electroncis are necessary to drive Photonex based Deformable Mirrors having several thousand channels of actuation with Angstrom level precision. Low noise is needed to maintain dimensional stability during longduration exposures. High-density is required for low power, low volume packaging anticipated for both space flight systems and commerical instruments. Mulitplexing is needed to substantially reduce the per channel cost of the dirver system. If selected,the proposed effort will produce a 512 and 1,024 channel driver board that is capable of driving mirror configurations having between 4,096 and 16,384 channels of actuation. It is the intent of this effort to produce a low noise hybrid platform andpopulate a flight qualifiable board capable in production of addressing a deformable mirror format having actuator spacings of 1 (NASA), 2.5 (Military) and 5 mm (Industry).Xinetics has reviewed the commerical industry in terms of optical precision and available finacial base.

Large aperture systems require large, very precise, very stable, ground testable opticalsurfaces. Current State of the Art primary mirror technology is heavy and has limited mirror shape control. Passive, monolithic mirrors such as the Hubble Space Telescope have an areal density of 250-Kg/m2. In order to substantially improve theperformance of primary mirrors, an active, thin meniscus mirror can be substituted. The meniscus mirror features a thin facesheet mounted onto an array of actuators directly attached to a stiff reaction structure. This configuration can reduce the arealdensity to 10-Kg/m2. Mirror design and materials limit areal density and aperture size. Xinetics proposes designing a 30-cm primary mirror that can be used in small, lightweight imaging satellites. This technology provides a very lightweight system withactive control of the mirror. The active control can reduce the polishing requirements by correcting for errors. Also, the reaction-bonded silicon carbide fabricated by Xinetics is fabricated with mold technology lending itself easily to mass productiontechniques. Each year there is a growing need for advanced imaging systems for both defense and spaced-base imaging systems. Programs such as ABL and SBL on the government side will require light, fast, inexpensive components to meet the needs of a largefleet of ABL airplanes or SBL satellites. For either flight system, weight and performance are important parameters in the overall system design. Small, complete, silicon carbide telescopes will serve to provide that type of capability. These techniquescould be applied to fabricated somewhat larger monolithic primaries that would be needed for programs such as this. In addition, small tactical imaging systems would benefit greatly. Satellite could be built for a fraction of what an imaging system costsnow and be available quickly if tensions around the world increased.This type of technology would also serve space applications. NASA continues to develop orbital imaging systems for astronomical and earth resources applications. Moderate size imaging systems could be used for specific astronomical applications and alsofor earth resources applications. Again, a system that could readily correct inherent aberrations would offer a greater range of applications and provide significantly improved results over current systems.

To achieve the large apertures, standard telescope designs containing heavy optical components that are time consuming and expensive to fabricate are obsolete. The current thrust is the use of polymer membranes and PVDF piezoelectric films that offer the potential to build mirrors in excess of 10m with areal densities below 1-kg/m2. However, these programs offer a challenge to design, materials and optical engineers to achieve a mirror that holds the optical surface within the required tolerances. The membrane approach is subject to thermally induced distortions, does not provide the necessary in-plane stiffness to mitigate distortions, and still requires wires/cables for actuator addressing. Xinetics proposes the Lightweight Active Nanolaminate Mirror with E-beam Shape Control. The thick-film nanolaminate has a greater in-plane stiffness than the polymer membranes and thus can maintain greater optical tolerances.

The Large Scale Integrated Meniscus combinesthe desirable material properties of a silicon carbide substrate embedded with electroactive actuators and sensors, and application specific integrated circuits to autonomously control the figure of the mirror. The proposed project takes advantage of therecently completed 1.5-meter CERAFORM facility to produce ultra-lightweight, near-net shape mirror substrates containing integral arrays of high strain electroactive actuators. Agile optical processing will be used to produce precision aspheres usingconventional, spherical polishing methods. Combining stress mirror polishing such as that used to fabricate the Keck telescope segments with an active blocking body containing shape control actuators, agile processing enables the cost-effective productionof hundreds of mirrors at the rate of 1 per week.

Normally separate devices that increase the complexityof the beam train handle these functions. Two problems must be addressed. First, high-power laser systems degrade the optical quality of their beam trains through heating of the optics, vibration, and relatively poor beam quality from the laser itself.Xinetics proposes a lightweight silicon carbide meniscus mirror that can perform low-order correction and low-amplitude precision pointing. The meniscus can perform low-order correction that depends on the number of cells. Tilt can be compensated usingthe individual cells and also by using actuators to bend a retaining ring. Such a device would have application within a space based laser system as a pointing device and within the turret of an airborne laser system as a corrector/pointer. The actuatorsused would be specially made to operate with full stroke at high frequencies thereby extending the usable range of the correction. The only limitation would be with the electronics used to driver the mirror. This correction device can have wide ranging applications in a variety of government and commercial programs.

It has been a design criteria that as the bandwidth increased, the amplitude decreased specific to a power spectral density profile set forth for the application. Recent test results have shown that present mirrors are limited by theability of the actuators to withstand the high peak current loads required for the high gain bandwidth operational mode. Recent test results have also shown that present deformable mirror driver electronics do not source enough peak current to drive theactuator capacitive load to stable, high gain bandwidth products.

Ealey,,(508) 486-0181,,,,,,"Historically, the full aperture of a high energy laser mirror has been liquid cooled with enough coolant to handle the peak absorbed thermal flux load over the entire mirror. Previous high energy laser mirrors considered only highly conductive materials and cooling schemes which minimized thermal distortion. Then, the advent of very low absorption coatings and silicon optics provided a laser mirror technology which could withstand high flux loads without liquid cooling. But, in laser weapons systems contamination is a very real concern and ultimately leads to increased absorption. The increased absorption causes increased thermal distortion and reduced beam quality which can greatly reduce beam flux at the target. Increased absorption also causes the mirror surface and valuable VLA coating to heat up, potentially to the point of catastrophic damage. Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of adaptive pumping. The adaptive pumps contain shape memory elements which sense coolant temperature and once activated by absorbed heat flux, pump coolant into the heat exchanger at a rate proportional to the heat flux. Xray synchrotron systems being developed by Argonne, Brookhaven, National Laboratories require cooled silicon optics to sample the xray beam. These systems currently use cooled mirror with complex coolant systems. The adaptive mirrors will reduce the cost by a factor of 10 and could become standard in xray lithography systems."

Approximately one in every eight women is diagnosed with breast cancer at some time in their life and 30% to 40% of the women who get breast cancer die. Early and accurate detection is viewed asthe best method to decrease breast cancer mortality. Therefore improving the accuracy and effectiveness of breast cancer detection has a vital value in improving women's health in US and worldwide. Mammography is an effective tool and currently widely used for early detection of breast cancer. It has played a substantial role in reducing the breast cancer mortality rate by over 20% in the last decade. However, limitations of mammography have been well publicized, such as very high false positive (70 -90%) and false negative (-30%) rates. The problem arises from the difficulty in identifying cancerous mass and Mes due to overlapping breast tissues. Today's mammography techniques rely on a pair of 2-D X-ray images of the breast, taken from two different directions: top to bottom and side to side. The breast is pulled away from the body, compressed, and held between two glass plates to ensure that the whole breast is viewed. The images are then read by a radiologist. Breast cancer, which is denser than most healthy nearby breast tissue, appears as irregular white areas. Due to the 2-D imaging nature of mammography, breast cancer structures can be hidden in the overlapping tissue and not show up on the mammogram. Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) isa 3-D imaging technique which can overcome the tissue overlap problem. It takes multiple x-ray pictures of each breast from many angles. The breast is positioned the same way it is in a conventional mammogram. In all current commercial DBT scanners, the x-ray tube moves in an arc around the breast while 11 to 25 images are taken during an 8 to 40-second examination. Then the information is sent to a computer, where it is reconstructed to produce 3-D images of the breast. DBT has the potential to revolutionize mammography by significantly reducing the tissue overlap problem inherent in conventional 2-D mammography. In principle, DBT may lead to improved sensitivity and specificity, fewer recalls, fewer biopsies, lower false alarm rates, and reducedemotional impact, and DBT is expected to become a standard screening and diagnostic tool for breast cancer in the future.

Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), a 3-D imaging modality, is generally considered as the next generation screening device with improved performance compared to the full-field digital mammography. The current DBT scanners however suffer from low spatial resolution and relatively long scanning time due to mechanical motion of the x-ray source and patient motion whichcompromise the sensitivity for micro-calcification detection and result in prolonged patient discomfort. We propose to develop a novel stationary DBT (s-DBT) system with enhanced spatial resolution and reduced scanning time compared to the current systems.The system utilizes the carbon nanotube multi-beam field emission x-ray technology (MBFEX) to collect all the projection images without any mechanical motion."

CNT-based field emission devices require high quality CNTs to improve emission uniformity, current density, emission stability and lifetime. The current commercially available CNTs have limitations in terms of cost, poor field emission properties, and thermal stability. The company, in collaboraion with Duke University, discovered a proprietary method for growing few-walled CNTs (FECNTs), which show promising field emission performace compared to other commercially available CNTs. In this project, the company will (a) modify the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system to improve the safety and efficiency of the process, investigage the effects of catalyst composition and CVD conditions on the structure and morphology of the FWCNTs produced and enhance the adhesion between the CNTs and the matrix materials in the FWCNT cathode films.

We believe such a system will be useful for a wide range of applications but for this proposal we will concentrate on wild fire research, fire mapping and detection, detection of small cooking fires associated with illegal crops hidden in forest lands (""narco-campfires""), and disaster response in general. The proposed system is designed to operate autonomously at altitudes from 3,000 to 30,000 feet. For our notional operational concept we will use an altitude of 23,000 feet. In persistent stare mode, the aircraft operating at this altitude will circle a flight path approximately 6 miles in diameter (similar to a typical holding pattern). In this scenario, the Staring Wide Area Imager will scan and 8 mile diameter area on the ground, the imagery from the two or three spectral bands will be analyzed in real time for fire detection, the resulting image maps will be orthorectified in real time, compressed, and sent to the ground across a standard data communication link. In this scenario the system will provide multi-spectral imagery of this entire area, approximately 50 square miles, once a minute, with virtually no delay. The result will resemble a moving weather map commonly used by the TV weather folks to inform people of coming rain. We intend to do the same thing, but with fire. In mapping mode the system will function as an across track scanner. In this mode, operating from the notional altitude of 23,000 feet the system will map over 2000 square miles per hour (assumes an aircraft speed of 200 knots). Please note that this is just an example and the other altitudes and speeds will also work. For fire science work, we propose to configure the system with three bands: LWIR (8 to 9 um), MWIR (4 - 5 um), and (funds permitting) a SWIR band around 1.6 um. Each of these sensors will have a 600 urad instantaneous field of view producing a ground sample distance of approximately 14 feet from our notional operating altitude of 23,000 feet. At this altitude the system will be capable of detecting a 6 inch by 6 inch 600 degree C fire. In addition to providing valuable detection and mapping information to the emergency responders we believe this ability to stare at a fire in motion will provide valuable information to fire science researchers and will lead to a better understanding of wildfire behavior in general."

Such a battery would improve the performance and reliability of existing power infrastructure, and it would ultimately enable storing backup power from intermittent renewable sources, such as wind and solar. US grid storage capacity today is less than 0.01% of daily generation, 95% of which is geographically-limited pumped hydroelectric storage technology that is already installed where possible. The demand for new grid-level energy storage is seen in the growing use of portable lithium ion technology as a stopgap measure, with storage deployments in 2019 nearly doubling compared to 2018. Specifically, this project will enable a new battery with instant response that is inexpensive, has a 20+ year stability, and is non-flammable. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to validate the use of inexpensive and easy-to-manufacture materials in the fabrication of the cell components of a pH-neutral aqueous, organic redox flow battery (RFB). Current commercial RFBs, such as vanadium systems, utilize expensive materials to withstand their corrosive electrolytes and extreme pH levels. This leads to high component and fabrication costs for the electrochemical cell, inhibiting translation of the technology. Using mild chemistry in pH-neutral conditions is likely to enable the use of inexpensive cell materials. This research project will work to ensure that ubiquitous, inexpensive, and easy-to-manufacture fabrication materials do not impact the stability of a novel 20+ year lifetime pH-neutral aqueous organic flow battery. These materials, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride and other common rubbers and plastics, will be systematically exposed to both the charged and neutral electrolyte for subsequent analysis by NMR, LC/MS, mass spectrometry, surface characterization, stress tests, and various other techniques to ensure that no degradation of their chemical or physical properties occurs.

Current radioembolic Y-90 microspheres have been generally recognized as the state-of-the-art for treating
primary and metastatic liver tumors. However, the clinical results vary vastly due to the lack of accurate
diagnostic imaging for dose and treatment planning and the lack of image guidance and dose conformation
during the administration of Y-90 microspheres. The investigation team has established the feasibility of
using PET imaging agent alone or along with Y-90. All key feasibilities have been demonstrated as
proposed in Phases I andamp; II. This proposed Phase IIB research focuses on the preparation of radioembolic Y-
90 microspheres at therapeutic levels of Y-90 with enhanced personnel safety, and the research also focuses
on the calibration of Y-90 dose distribution that is critical and practical for real-time Y-90 dosimetry to
improve much desired efficacy. The objectives of this proposed Phase IIB research are (1) to establish a
microfabrication process for on-demand production of PET emitting microspheres using commercially viable
glass compositions, (2) to reliably produce low-cost Y-90 radioisotope, (3) to assess biocompatibility and
biological risks to gain FDA acceptance for a human clinical investigation, and (4) to demonstrate clinical
utility of PET emitting glass microspheres. Successful completion of the proposed Phase IIB research will
lead to PET-enabled Y-90 glass microspheres to improve patient safety and to advance Y-90
radioembolization from palliative treatment to curative treatment for liver cancer, especially primary liver
cancer. In addition, this Phase IIB advanced development has the potential to drastically reduce the cost of
Y-90 radioembolization agents so that this treatment option is more affordable in addition to being more
effective.Project Narrative
A successful real-time quantitative dosimetry assessment has the potential to dramatically improve the efficacy of Y-90
radioembolization for the treatment of primary and metastatic tumors. It is now technologically feasible to have optimal
patient dose planning and intraoperative dose escalation to the tumors without the risk of overdosing the healthy tissue
or organs. Unexpected shunting of Y-90 radioembolic microspheres and, more importantly, over-embolization with
reflux of the Y-90 microspheres into gastrointestinal arteries can be detected early, and corrective actions can be taken
intraoperatively during the administration of the Y-90 radioembolic microspheres. The proposed imaging-only embolic
microsphere also has the potential to become an ideal dose-planning device for current Y-90 radioembolic microspheres
(TherasphereÂ® or SIR-SpheresÂ®) so that a much broader applicability of this development can be achieved for the
maximum benefits to liver cancer patients. The low cost of this imaging-enabled Y-90 microsphere is most significant
in making this effective radioembolization device more affordable to patients in USA and in developing regions of the
world."

However, the clinical results vary vastly dueto the lack of accurate diagnostic imaging for dose and treatment planning, and the lack of image guidance and dose conformation during the administration of Y-90 microspheres. The best practice to date is to use Tc99m labeled macroaggregated albumin (Tc99m-MAA) to simulate the distribution of radioembolic Y-90 microspheres for screening patients and for dose planning and to use Bremsstrahlung radiation of Y-90 or to use the extremely low internal pair production of Y-90 to qualitatively assess the administered Y-90 only in a post-treatment procedure. The investigators propose, as the enabling step toward improving efficacy, to make microspheres PET imageable for the best sensitivity and real-time distribution of Y-90 microspheres. Microspheres with just PET isotopes (i.e. no Y-90) are ideal and invaluable for patient screening and dose and treatment planning for all Y-90 microspheres, including current Therasphere(R) and SIR-Spheres(R). Microspheres encapsulated with both PET isotopes and Y- 90 will enableintraoperative dose escalation to the tumors to enhance both safety and efficacy, and postoperative monitoring and dose confirmation. The Phase I research focuses on the preparation of microspheres with PET isotopes that accurately reveal their distribution using PET imaging techniques and other complimentary imaging techniques. The specific aims are to (1) identify compatible host matrices and compatible processing techniques for the creation of PET enabled microspheres for dose planning and for the creation of PET enabled Y-90 microspheres for radioembolization of liver tumors; (2) immobilize sufficient levels of positron emitters for optimal PET images; (3) control the cumulative radioactivity leakage from the microspheres to lt 1% to ensure that PET images accurately represent the spatial distribution of Y-90 microspheres; and (4) assess preliminary biocompatibility using standard toxicity screening. The Phase II research will begin with in vivo PET imaging characterization and in vivo biocompatibility assessment and end with preliminary clinical assessment of using PET enabled microspheres for patient screening, dose planning, and intraoperative dose escalation of Y-90 microspheres to the tumors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The successful introduction of positron emitting microspheres (PET microspheres) has the potential to dramatically improve the efficacy of radioembolic Y-90 microspheres for the treatment of primary and metastatic tumors in the liver by optimal patient dose planning and intraoperative dose escalation to the tumors through quantitative and real-time PET imaging. The use of PET microspheres is expected to improve the safety of Y-90 microspheres treatment of liver cancer patients through better prediction of Y-90 microspheres and real-time monitoring of the administration of Y-90 microspheres. Unexpected shunting of Y-90 microspheres and especially over-embolization with reflux of agent into gastrointestinal arteries can be detected early, and corrective actions can be taken intraoperatively during the administration of Y-90 microspheres. This project is to establish the feasibility of encapsulating (not labeling) PET isotopes and/or Y-90 isotopes in timed-bioabsorbable microspheres without radioisotope leakage. The PET enabled microspheres without Y-90 are ideal surrogates to current radioembolic microspheres (Therasphere(R) or SIR-Spheres(R)) for optimal dose and treatment planning and perfect surrogates to the next generation Y-90 microspheres, which will include companion PET radioisotopes for quantitative imaging."

Different radioisotope and biomolecule usually require different linkage to bind the radioisotope to the targeting biomolecule. This pr
oposed research is to create modular nano radioisotope sources for improving tumor targeting. Using fusion at the nano-scale, a class of new and low cost radioisotope sources can be created with the most desirable energy spectrum possible and can be modula
rized and functionalized to revolutionize targeted delivery. Phase I of the proposed research will focus on the creation and functionalization of the nano-fused radioisotope sources. These nano radioisotopes are, potentially, ideal to be functionalized as
a modular labeling block especially useful for targeted therapy. In vitro characterization of modularized and functionalized nano radioisotope sources will include radioactivity containment measurements in simulated body fluid. The labeling of such nano-fu
sed radioisotope sources to selected biomolecules will be the focus of the Phase II research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tumor targeting is similar to a smart bomb aiming and destroying its target. The complication is to discover a working linkage to couple
between a selected radioisotope (the bomb ) and a chosen targeting biomolecule. This project takes the first step in creating a plug-and-play tumor targeting system by modularizing radioisotope sources using fusion at the nano-scale such that linkages t

An optimum degree of membrane rupture will maintain the viability of a cell population and achieve receptiveness to the desired exogenous molecule(s). The micrograte system concept is simple and economical, and appears to be an ideal device for gene transfection. Emphasis will be placed on the microfabrication of microgrates, the detailed configuration of the microgrates and the surface chemistry of the grating elements. Phase II of this research will focus on the evaluation of several prototypes of micrograte systems for gene therapy applications.

Both temporary and permanent gamma-emitting radioseeds have gained acceptance for interstitial implantation in the prostate. Due to greater tissue penetration, however, gamma radiation can cause side effects in the patient such as gastrointestinal discomfort, can cause damage to healthy tissues outside the prostate, and can be hazardous to hospital personnel and family members. The objective of this Phase I research is to demonstrate the feasibility of using timed-bioresorbable glass matrices to encapsulate high energy, beta-emitting radioisotopes such as Y-90. Ideally, seeds from such glasses will not leak radioactivity within 10 half-lives, and will be completely bioresorbed at a predetermined rate.

In addition, chemoprevention agents can be incorporated into the timed-bioresorbable matrix so that their release over time will help to prevent the reoccurrence of the cancer. If successful, timed-bioresorbable glass radioseeds will be a low cost alternative to permanent seeds, and will positively impact radiation therapy of prostate and other cancers.

Verus Research has teamed with Georgia Tech and Penn State on this effort to propose VEREUS, the VErification and RE-planning for Unmanned aerial system Safety tool, which leverages a unified formal methods foundation to verify that multiple forms of risk do not exceed prespecified levels for given UAS trajectories, and to mitigate risks as necessary. The purpose of VEREUS is to automate as much of the trajectory safety verification and necessary re-planning as possible, in as rigorous a manner as possible despite the myriad uncertainties present in UAS Traffic Management (UTM), to decrease the burden on the UAS operator and future UAS Service Suppliers while improving safety, thus significantly increasing the number of UAS that can be managed by a single entity. To achieve this goal, we propose the following tool features: a) offline trajectory assessment to ensure compliance with risk and other Air Navigation Service Provider directed constraints, b) re-planning as required to meet any constraints initially violated, and c) real-time support to ensure continued safety as requirements and trajectories change online.

The Verus Research team proposes a combination of transverse Lyapunov stability and reachability analysis techniques to verify robust stability and invariance properties of GN&C algorithms. In Phase I, we will focus on verifying stability requirements of the attitude control system, with extensions to more general requirements and algorithms in Phase II.

Use of the DD technique will enable us to handle multi-scale, extreme-size computational domains. The DD method requires decomposition of the computational domain into smaller subdomains. Each subdomain is gridded independently with an unstructured mesh. Then the Maxwells equations are discretized to a system of semi-discrete ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Both explicit and implicit solvers will be developed for solving the ODEs. Theoretically, the explicit method will be equivalent to the FDTD method. But the DGTD method is more flexible and efficient than the FDTD in terms of dealing with complex geometries and time integration.

The electromagnetic characteristics of an ideal radome are similar to a band-pass or a band-stop digital filter: it is opaque to hostile signals, but is transparent to friendly ones.

Having a good estimate of system recuperation time is as important as bounding the target system probability of effect. The Restoration Time Measurement System (RTMS) will allow AFRL/RDHE to collect recuperation time data much more easily, and in an automated and repeatable way, so that meaningful amounts of data can be collected each year. The system will also be flexible and maintainable so that it can be adapted to new PC and network hardware. Additional systems can be built to benefit other military branches in the same way. RTMS can also be used to study the impact of network partial functionality, such as in the cyber world to determine the impact of electronic attack or otherwise degraded communications.

improper recruitment of immune cells can lead to a variety of inflammatory pathologies with devastating effects
on a patientâs quality of life. The chemokine CCL20 and its G protein-coupled receptor CCR6 drive the
development of psoriasis through the initiation and continuous recruitment of inflammatory Th17-expressing
cells into the dermis. Our recently published biochemical, cell-based and in vivo studies prove that an
engineered recombinant protein that mimics the dimeric version of the natural CCL20 molecule completely
reverses its normal pro-inflammatory functional profile. This lead compound (CCL20LD), invented by the PI at
the Medical College of Wisconsin, prevented the development and progression of psoriatic dermatitis (PsD) in
a preclinical mouse model that faithfully recapitulates human psoriasis. During PFâs SBIR Phase I grant award
period, we successfully completed all three milestones focused on the preclinical development of CCL20LD as
a psoriatic therapy. First, using a new systemic, IL-23 minicircle model, Protein Foundry showed that CCL20LD
alleviated signs of skin inflammation after disease establishment, demonstrating that CCL20LD is efficacious
as a therapeutic treatment in a clinically relevant model of human psoriasis. Second, CCL20LD was
shown in preliminary serological analyses to be relatively safe, with no accumulation of hepatic or nephrotic
biomarkers of tissue damage. Third, PF validated a reproducible manufacturing and quality control protocol for
the CCL20LD protein. Given the successful completion of the phase I work and the notable efficacy in animals,
we propose to develop CCL20LD as a next-generation treatment for psoriasis. To perform the R/Randamp;D
necessary for an IND, this phase II application proposes to develop an optimized dosing schedule using
clinically relevant animal models, and validate the safety profile in rodents to guide IND-enabling GLP
toxicology studies in non-human primates. In Aim 1 of this application, Protein Foundry and its academic
collaborators at UC Davis will establish the therapeutic dose and schedule which produces the strongest anti-
psoriatic effect in the shortest time period. In Aim 2, Protein Foundry will use cytokine storm and anti-drug
antibody assays to test immunogenicity and establish a toxicology profile in rodents to guide GLP toxicology
studies in non-human primates. Lastly, in Aim 3, Protein Foundry will explore topical formulations for testing in
animal models as a first key step in differentiating CCL20LD from current market therapeutics and fully
establish CCL20LDâs targeted product profile. Altering CCR6 signaling through the engineering of its native
ligand is an innovative paradigm shift in clinical approaches for treating auto-inflammatory diseases.
Development of engineered CCL20 variants as biological therapeutics will have significant positive impact
for psoriasis patients by reducing side effects and providing a drug with extended therapeutic lifetimes.
Moreover, the resultant method has the potential for treating other Th17-mediated diseases.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Chemokines are soluble proteins that direct migrating immune cells to sites of foreign invasion. Aberrant
chemokine function can lead to cancers and inflammatory diseases. In particular, CCL20 has been linked to
the pathophysiology of human psoriasis, the most common inflammatory skin disease. The goal of this Phase
II SBIR project is to perform the necessary R/Randamp;D activities to guide IND-enabling studies and the eventual
first-in-man trials of CCL20LD as a psoriatic therapy.

This work is aimed to improve outcomes in patients with kidney disease through improved diagnostics.
Nephron mass is a measure of the functional capacity of the kidney. Its measurement could be transformative
in detecting susceptibility to and progression of kidney diseases. However, no clinical tools or assays currently
exist to directly measure nephron mass. We have developed tools using a novel targeted contrast agent
(RadioCF) to directly measure nephron mass using positron emission tomography (PET). This technology,
RadioCF-PET, has the potential to provide a more accurate assessment of kidney health and aid clinical
decisions for patient treatment. RadioCF-PET also has the potential to be used in the assessment and
allocation of renal transplants. This proposal will establish the feasibility of RadioCF-PET to measure nephron
mass using a human recombinant form of RadioCF (HrRadioCF) to minimize toxicity, control synthesis and
demonstrate the potential of this technology for clinical use. We will measure nephron mass in mice in vivo
using RadioCF-PET with human recombinant RadioCF. We will perform initial toxicity studies with HrRadioCF
to establish the safety of this radiotracer in mice that will inform the safety and efficacy testing in a Phase II
proposal. In Phase II, we will perform extensive toxicity studies and characterization of the agent to support an
exploratory investigational new drug application. Future application of RadioCF-PET will first focus on the
evaluation of donor kidneys before transplant in both live and deceased donors to monitor allograft health
during transit, and then will be adapted to monitor graft function after transplantation. Transplant evaluation
provides a pathway to in-patient use of this technology as a new screening tool to monitor kidney health. This
technology also has the potential to monitor patients at risk for kidney disease, such as patients with diabetes,
indicating a large potential market for impact.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Chronic kidney disease affects ~15% of the US population and the majority of patients are diagnosed too late
to benefit from early intervention. This proposal will aid in the development of a new diagnostic tool for the
kidney to enable early detection of diseases and to monitor overall kidney health."

Traditional random cultures allow limited access to subcellular compartments (axons, dendrites, synapses) due to extensive and haphazard growth of neurons. Our long-term goal is to provide robust, user-friendly, and cost effective culture platforms that can optically, fluidically, and biochemically access neurons and their subcellular compartments. Data acquired through sales of prototype platforms developed and patented by our team show a large and increasing demand. Customer feedback also indicates that technological improvements would make our platforms more accessible and user-friendly. Such improvements include ensuring greater uniformity of the device, reducing end-user assembly procedures, and enhancing viability for the long-term culturing period that is often needed for neurons. Thus, our first aim focuses on addressing these issues by (1) incorporating cell loading ports into the platform to reduce cell loading errors, (2) improving feature uniformit through the development of high-resolution, durable metal molds, (3) developing methods to reduce evaporative losses that impair neuron viability, (4) increasing the wettability and biocompatibility of the device material through surface modification, and (5) covalently linking extracellular matrix proteins onto glass to minimize end-user assembly. The successful completion of this aim will result in a consistent, cost-effective, and ready-to-use neuron-cell culture platform. Our next aim focuses on the development of novel cell-based tools to study synapses, the cornerstone of neuroscience. There is considerable demand for methods to isolate synapses and there are limitations in existing techniques. In Aim 2 we will develop user-friendly synapse isolation tools, expanding on core technological advancements from Aim 1. Aim 2 will involve (1) development of stable, artificial synaptic bead targets allowing novel investigations of the presynaptic compartment and (2) development of a three-compartment synapse isolation platform that exploits device geometry and synaptic beads to encourage synapse formation within an isolated synaptic compartment. The successful completionof this aim will result in a user-friendly, accessible, and innovative cell-based tool to optically and biochemically probe synapses. The significance of the proposed work is to improve research scientists' ability to visualize, manipulate, and measure cultured neurons leading to greater understanding of the underlying causes of neurological diseases. This research is innovative because we seek to shift current research paradigms through the development of novel cell-based tools to isolate synapses that maintain intact cell morphology in the absence of somata or glia.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because technology developed in this proposal will facilitate investigations of neurological illnesses and injury. The project is relevant to NIH's mission because it will provide a user-friendly and novel tool for cellular neuroscience, advancing the study of neuronal and synaptic function."

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are used to provide mapping capabilities in billions of devices annually, but an estimated 140 million have critical needs for high security and/or accuracy. Furthermore, future cyber-physical systems, such as self-driving cars and aerial mobility, will have higher performance requirements, including safety-critical operation, precision positioning, and cyber-security for billions of devices. This project will advance a new positioning system. This SBIR Phase I project proposes the development of a space-based Atmospheric Mapping and Satellite Integrity Monitoring system (AMSIM) to support a high-integrity, precise positioning service from a Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellite navigation constellation. This requires monitoring satellites for faults and mapping ionospheric and tropospheric conditions, traditionally accomplished via a network of ground infrastructure, such as the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS). However, to achieve the precision needed for autonomous systems, ground monitoring stations must be spaced less than 100 km apart, limiting performance over oceans and other remote areas. This work proposes the investigation of a space-based monitoring approach for a ubiquitous service. It will leverage inter-satellite communication links for integrity monitoring, techniques in GNSS Radio Occultation (RO) for tropospheric monitoring, and tomography for ionospheric mapping. This Phase I project will use physical models, computer simulation, and available atmospheric data products derived from RO and ground-based monitoring approaches for validation.

The concept leverages the Multiple MiniatureKill Vehicle (MMKV) concept as a means of deployment for small High Power Microwave (HPM) short pulse (impulse) emitters. Traditionally, HPMs have been examined from a threat perspective. HPM device technology has advanced to such a point, that it is nowfeasible to examine using small HPM emitters as an integral part of a defense system. HPM devices support large peak powers and some devices now support multiple pulse operation. These advancements allow HPMs to be used as small impulse radars that canbe deployed aboard or from the MMKVs. The primary objective of this SBIR will be to determine the feasibility of using these HPM device signals to perform the BMD Discrimination function. Techniques to be examined will include: 1) exploiting bi-staticradar cross sections, 2) utilization of the impulse signal to generate multiple geometry wideband range profiles and 3) utilization of the impulse signal to generate multi-dimension range doppler images. Anticipated Benefits: This HPM impulse radarconcept provides multiple viewing geometries with high range resolution signature profiles. This will provide a powerful discrimination capability as well as a hedge against closely spaced"

Many articles have been written highlighting this concern, some postulating that the National Missile Defense system could bedefeated by several unclassified countermeasures. The proposed concept expands the potential functions of MMKV deployed HPM devices to include the innovative use of bistatic radar signature collection for object discrimination.The basic MMKV concept is to use multiple, small interceptors which might be packaged on a booster.

THIS ALLOWS A COMPLEX OF FIXED RECEIVER ANTENNA BEAM(S) TO COVER THE DESIRED AZIMUTH EXTENT. THE RF FREQUENCY OF EACH RECEIVER IS SWEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DESIRED RANGE COVERAGE. THE ISSUES TO BE STUDIED UNDER THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDE CANDIDATE GEOMETRIES, ANTENNA TYPES, WAVEFORM DESIGN, SNR AND SCR, TARGET AND CLUTTER PROCESSING, RECEIVER TUNING ALGORITHMS, COHERENCY, POTENTIAL RANGE PERFORMANCE, MEASUREMENT ACCURACIES, AND OTHER TOP-LEVEL SYSTEMS CONSIDERATIONS."

More specifically, it will aim to make it easier to connect open jobs with the talents of job seekers. The innovation proposed here will redefine job search in a time when the labor market is in major flux, and the technology developed in this project will enable job searching to move far beyond a one-page resume and focus more on the skills needed to succeed in a job. In so doing, the innovation will enable job seekers to find new opportunities that are aligned with their career interests and enable employers to find skilled talent matched to their project needs. Employers using this technology will be able to search for talent according to what they need performed, without necessarily knowing how the task will be performed. Similarly, job seekers will be able to search for jobs that they may not have known existed but are still strongly aligned with their career goals. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a skills-to-tasks matching system that serves as a basis for which worker skills are employed to perform which tasks on the job. Currently, available data on the skill content of occupations does not capture variation across industries, geographies, or over time. Nor does it capture the applicability of a worker's current skills to new workplace tasks, an important consideration for up-skilling and re-training programs. This limitation has left a major source of information asymmetry intact in the 21st century job market, where the most effective talent search strategy remains peer-referrals. This same lack of granularity in available data has limited the effectiveness of policymakers to measure the skills-gap, identify career pathways, and design training programs most needed in their local economies. The research proposed in this project will produce an up-to-date compendium of the skills and work activities that are evolving in the labor market and map the relationships between them. This technology will provide a dynamic and granular view of the labor market and improve the quality of information available to decision-makers in industry, education, workforce development, as well as for the study of the future of work.

Point of Care Lung CT for patients with Acute Respiratory Failure
Two million patients develop acute respiratory failure requiring hospitalization in the US each
year, with half requiring mechanical ventilation and more than 20% dying before discharge.
Identifying underlying pulmonary pathologies in these patients is essential to ensuring they
receive the right treatment, but standard chest imaging, a portable chest X-ray exam, poorly
discriminates important pulmonary pathology in patients receiving invasive mechanical
ventilation. Computed Tomography (CT) can identify pneumonia, pleural effusion, and/or
pulmonary embolism (with contrast load) that may otherwise go undetected. Yet the risks and
burden of moving critically ill patients to a conventional CT scanner is a significant barrier to
safely performing CT in this population. A âpoint-of-careâ CT scanner in the intensive care unit
(ICU) would transform how care is provided to these patients. However, a portable device that is
compact and low radiation yet capable of thoracic CT imaging does not currently exist.
In this SBIR Phase II project, Xoran intends to develop and clinically validate a compact, mobile
yet highly functional system to provide point of care thoracic CT images suitable for use in
hospital ICUs and also deployable to field hospitals or other frontline settings. This effort builds
on a previously commercialized compact and portable flat-panel CT technology for cranial
applications, and leverages significant progress made in imaging capabilities for soft tissue
structures in the brain and a prototype portable and compact open gantry mechanism intended
for spine imaging. The project includes expansion of imaging capabilities using larger format
detectors operating at fast frame rates in order to capture the larger volume of the lungs within
the constraints of a patients breathing cycle. Self-shielding and self-disinfecting features will be
incorporated to maximize safety and optimize workflows. Clinical evaluation will take place at
the University of Michigan. Partnering with a team of Pulmonary and Critical Care physicians,
thoracic radiology, and ICU nursing leadership, it will then establish the safety and clinical utility
of point-of-care Thoracic CT system in support of FDA 510k submission leading to an approved
indication for use and commercially viable product.Narrative / Relevance to Public Health

The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a portable and affordable cranial x-ray-based Computed
Tomography Perfusion (CT-P) device for expedited front-line evaluation and triage of ischemic cerebral stroke
victims.
CT-P is the gold standard modality for assessment and classifying stroke patients to determine the best
candidates for revascularizing procedures; however, CT-P is generally unavailable early in the current acute
care treatment model. Unlike existing conventional CT-P equipment which is generally large, expensive, and
stationary, the proposed device would be compact, portable, and affordable to be deployed in nursing homes,
urgent care centers, hospital ER triage areas, ICUs, and EMS response vehicles, yet also provide sufficient
time and contrast resolution for reliable perfusion metrics.
Rapidly acquired point-of-care CT and CT-P images showing blood flow, volume, and transit times will enable
(1) early classification of hemorrhage or ischemic, and (2) assessment of the recoverable brain tissue volume.
This will enable early screening evaluation for appropriate acute stroke patient prioritization and routing. In
addition, it may also provide an economical and safe bedside means of assessing cranial perfusion for follow
up care in the ICU, recovery room, or even eventually in a residential care setting.
Xoran Technologies LLC specializes in point-of-care (POC) medical imaging and has successfully marketed
over 750 POC imaging devices in the US.Project Narrative
When an individual is suffering from acute stroke, time is of the essence; however, it is critically important to
assess the type of stroke as well as the amount and location of potentially recoverable brain tissue to
determine the appropriate routing and priority to achieve the best outcome for that individual.
In this project a new compact and portable device is proposed that allows cranial perfusion studies to be
performed earlier in the process than the current standard of care, potentially in a nursing home, urgent care
center, or in an emergency vehicle such as an ambulance.
Public health is affected both by the potential for improved outcomes for individuals, but also for systemwide
cost savings and efficiency gains by not transporting patients who are not likely to benefit from a trip to a level
one stroke treatment center."

updated instrument localization using next generation electromagnetic tool tip guidance. Workflow
optimizations become possible when the imaging and guidance are one device, including fast local
image updates, automatic image-to-world registration, as well as speed and simplicity of use. The
project includes expansion of the system capabilities to facilitate precise minimally-invasive surgical
removal of tumors in both the head and spine. It incorporates a machine-learning based deep neural
network method for image finalization to allow high quality, low radiation image updates.
The three-year project involves meeting technical milestones of system development including imaging
capability, registration, navigation accuracy, speed, workflow, radiation dose considerations and cost.
Clinical evaluations will take place at University of Michigan, and a team of consulting physicians has
been assembled for oversight, input and feedback.Narrative / Relevance to Public Health
Minimally invasive surgical procedures have many benefits to public health including reducing the medical risks
and costs associated with brain cancer and spine surgery. However such procedures are often time consuming
and technically difficult as the surgeon is unable to directly visualize the area of the operation.
In this project, an intraoperative surgical system is developed with onboard imaging capability in order to
enable minimally invasive surgeries to be performed more safely and completely, by providing hi-resolution
imaging of the brain and spine while the surgeon operates."

However unsedated patients with neurological conditions tend to move during the scan which degrades image quality in the soft-tissue / brain viewing windows. This proposal presents an innovative method to compensate for patient movement to restore image quality for CT exams. The method consists of software algorithms to estimate and correct patient movement from the projection data, employing inexpensive and readily available radio-opaque markers. This technology has the potential to improve timeliness, safety, and reliability of neuro-imaging in the ICU, CCU, and OR. Example applications include monitoring or detecting bleeds and infarcts, evaluating brain shift and compression, placing ventricular shunt catheters, and deep brain stimulation. Phase 1 will be devoted to the development of the motion compensation method and to demonstrating adequate imaging performance. Test data will be obtained from a head phantom subject with simulated brain hemorrhages and with realistic, mechanically-induced movement on a testbed. An algorithm will be developed to accurately estimate subject movement from the x-ray projections of radio-opaque markers attached to the head. Another algorithm will be developed to reconstruct images, incorporating the motion estimates. End-to-end tests will be performed with clinician feedback. In phase 2, the proposed device will be streamlined, including algorithm speedup, to enable practical use in clinical settings. Clinical studies will be performed to evaluate and refine the method for commercial launch. The commercial opportunity for the system is estimated to be over 5000 systems in the USA over 10 years, which would lead to the creation of approximately 100 jobs.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recently emergent compact CT devices can perform head CT scans directly in the ICU, CCU, and OR, and therefore have the potential to improve timeliness, safety, and reliability of neuro- imaging. An obstacle to fulfilling this potential is that these systems have longer scanning times than conventional CT devices, making imaging performance more vulnerable to patient motion. To overcome this obstacle, this project proposes to combine a highly compact, mobile flat panel CT system with a method for motion compensation."

The scanner, formerly dubbed DentoCAT, has been recently FDA approved and is currently being marketed under the name i-CAT through a partnership between Xoran Technologies and Imaging Sciences International. The scanner has met with an exceptionally high market adoption, with over twenty five orders taken in the first three months of marketing. As of the time of the writing of this grant, three units have been installed, with the rest scheduled for the upcoming weeks. While the scanner produces images with high spatial resolution and is well-suited to relatively high contrast imaging tasks, its current capability for low contrast imaging is limited. The same can be said for other commercially available dedicated dentomaxillofacial cone beam CT scanners. The ultimate goal of this project is to improve the capability of cone-beam CT technology to image low-contrast features. This will allow for the i-CAT system to be used in a broader range of dentomaxillofacial diagnostic situations including the detection and localization of soft-tissue lesions like cysts, tumors, and infections.

In many difficult procedures that involve vital structures, like the resection of tumors at the skull base, image-guidance can be a necessity. In such cases, the accuracy of the image guidance is often limited by the accuracy of imaging (especially registration). A fully integrated intraoperative image-guidance system combines both the imaging and guidance hardware into a single functioning system that can acquire highly accurate imagery repeatedly within the operating room (OR) environment. Such imagery is well-registered with the true patient coordinates since registration steps are not specifically needed. Moreover, having an intraoperative imager allows one to monitor changes in anatomy throughout a procedure and to assess progress. Such integrated systems have a great advantage over nonintegrated systems where the imagery is collected prior to a procedure followed by registration (i.e.: no updates, more chances for misregistration). Integrated systems based on magnetic resonance imaging are highly attractive due to image quality and lack of ionizing radiation; however, such units place heavy constraints on the OR and are very costly. Units based on ultrasound are inexpensive, but produce relatively poor imagery and are not suitable for regions near bony structures. To date a highly compact, interactive, inexpensive, integrated imaging and guidance system based on x-ray computed tomography (CT) has not been developed. Such a unit would fill a ""modality vacancy"" in intraoperative imaging and guidance, would provide updatable images familiar to surgeons, and would be particularly suited to difficult procedures like skull base surgery. We propose not only to build such a system (leveraging off previous developments at Xoran Technologies, Inc. for reducing the size of the imager and the effective dosage) but to evaluate the device through clinical trials for the specific task of resection of brain tumors."

The need for such a specialized instrument in the dentomaxillofacial field has existed for many years. The limitations of the existing imaging methods, however, have prevented their wider use in this field. DentoCAT will overcome these limitations. Specifically, DentoCAT will feature fully 3D capabilities and high contrast- and spatial resolution; it will be relatively inexpensive and will limit the patient's radiation dose. The initial design of DentoCAT will be focused for use in dental implantology: preoperative implant planning and postoperative assessment of a failed implant. It is further anticipated that DentoCAT will lead to the advancement of scientific knowledge and enable development of imaging techniques in the detection of TMJ disorders, facial fractures, lesions and diseases of soft tissue in the head and neck, including tumors, and in reconstructive facial surgery. Phase I will focus on estimating the optimum values for data acquisition and image reconstruction parameters. Based on this work, in Phase II, a fully operable, full-size prototype will be developed and tested on human subjects. In Phase III, DentoCAT will be made available for commercial applications in dental implantology. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The initial commercial use of DentoCAT will be in dental implantology. DentoCAT will be clinically used by small, midsize and large dentomaxillofacial facilities as well as by specialized oral radiology facilities, which are expected to grow in number after their recent approval as a dental specialty. The size of these markets and their acute need for a versatile imaging modality, as well as the estimated low cost of DentoCAT, suggest a commercial success for DentoCAT."

This will make wind energy more attractive economically, improve the energy security of the U.S, create jobs, and indirectly help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A 2% AEP increase is generally considered attractive. Two turbines (5kW and 50kW) tested during Phase I have shown an increase in AEP between 2% to 8% while reducing the COE by 1% to 6%. About 150,000 turbines worldwide can be potentially be retrofitted with this technology. This project will address challenges related to aerodynamic efficiency of wind turbines and the cost of wind energy. It is based on a deeper understanding of wind turbine aerodynamics from a more 3-dimensional point of view; most wind turbine designs are based on 2- dimensional theories. The key technical challenge in bringing this technology to market is to demonstrate the increase in AEP of utility scale turbines retrofitted with our deflector technology in realistic field conditions while reducing the COE. This will be addressed by performing testing at a few customer wind farms and NREL testing centers. The R&D plan consists of designing, manufacturing, and installing deflectors on a few utility size turbines (30-100 meters diameter rotors). The tests will include power performance comparison between baseline and retrofitted turbines according to international standards."

This technology will make wind energy more economically attractive, improve the energy security of the U.S., create hundreds of jobs and help to reduce coal and natural gas emissions by providing an alternative renewable energy source. An expected reduction in the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) by 8% would help reducing the price of this energy and signing of more wind power purchase agreements. Therefore US citizens would be paying less money out of their pockets on their electric bills. Additionally, big reduction of the cost of wind energy has attracted over $100 billion in private investment since 2008. An expected 10% increase in Annual Energy Production (AEP) would power an extra 1.8 million homes, reduce carbon pollution by 12.5 million metric tons and generate $180 million a year in tax payments to communities. Finally, the innovation proposed in this application has the potential to address both the efficiency demands of wind farm owners (reducing the break-even times) and providing a disruptive design innovation to turbine manufacturers for them to have a sustainable competitive edge. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address challenges related to aerodynamic efficiency of wind turbines. It focuses on developing aerodynamic flow deflectors to be mounted on the wind turbine blades. These can be incorporated into new wind turbine designs or retrofitted onto the thousands of currently operating turbines to increase their efficiency. By introducing the proposed flow deflector, the radial component of velocity of the incoming flow is redirected to produce an additional amount of torque and generate the extra power. From discussions with leading wind energy companies, there is a general agreement that this could be a game changer and one of the biggest improvements in wind turbines to date, but large scale field test validation is needed. Therefore, the key technical challenge to bring the technology to market that would be addressed in Phase I is to perform a field test of the flow deflectors in a large scale turbine (1-20 meter diameter) under realistic environmental conditions. The main goal for Phase I is to demonstrate the substantial power increase (AEP >2-3%) while reducing the cost of energy (LCOE >2%) when retrofitting a large scale commercial turbine with the proposed technology."

People in all facets of life are exposed to volatile toxins that may cause them to unexplainably sicken The
NIEHS Exposure Biology and Exposome Program has the ambitious and worthy goal to track a person s
exposures from conception to death and correlate these with biological responses and health outcomes
Achieving this goal will require numerous inexpensive sensors that can measure chemical exposure of a
mobile population under wildly varying conditions Continuous assessment of an individual s exposure over
long periods of time will require an extensive network of inexpensive fixed site and wearable monitors To
advance this goal this project aims to develop passive area and personal dosimeters that measure a personandapos s
exposure to chemicals by testing the air that the person breathes regardless of location Moreover since many
volatile toxin may not have been identified and their potential threat to health is unknown it is necessary that
these monitors can gather store and stabilize vapors from a broad array of chemical compounds with widely
varying chemical properties XploSafe plans to develop and commercialize the next generation of passive
dosimeters and area samplers for NIEHS and industrial hygiene applications The research will focus on
potential chemical contaminants that people could encounter through work related exposures or interactions
with their ambient environments The dosimeters will be based on a novel sorbent material that is capable of
adsorbing and stabilizing even highly reactive compounds through a nanoconfinement effect Thus these
dosimeters provide the chemical stability required for complete analysis before sample degradation takes
place Flexible control of surface chemistry and the ability to mix sorbents with varying functionalization can
allow creation of sorbent blends that address all classes of organic contaminants Specific research objectives
will include Preparation of target sorbents with surfaces tailored for sorption of various types of organic
chemicals Determination of the uptake capacities and rates of adsorption of target compounds belonging to
  different classes of airborne organic compounds Demonstrate the desorption and subsequent analysis
of adsorbed compounds Determine the effects of long term storage of monitors with adsorbed
contaminants and Design of dosimeter and area monitors to include a clip on badge and a fabric strip If
successful this project will result in the development of markedly improved wearable dosimeters and fixed site
monitors for determining personal exposure to hazardous vapors Commercialization of the new technology will
address NIEHS s needs and the civilian market for passive dosimeters and area monitors The solution will be
commercialized as a full service offering that will include dosimeter badges and analysis for specific and broad
categories of toxic vapors These could be used for continuous monitoring of both personal exposure and the
sites where exposure takes place The XploSafe solution will also allow industrial hygiene sampling such as
hour TWA time weighted average  orminute STEL short term exposure limit for workplace monitoring Project Narrative
People in all facets of life are exposed to volatile toxins that may cause them to unexplainably sicken leading to
a need for continuous measurement of an individual s exposure over long periods of time that in turn requires
an extensive network of area and personal dosimeters that measure a personandapos s exposure to chemicals by
testing the air that the person breathes regardless of where the person goes Moreover the individual
exposure to volatile toxin can be unpredictable due the person s mobility and knowledge of all potentially
volatile toxins in a given location may not be complete it is necessary that these monitors can gather store
and stabilize vapors from a broad array of chemical compounds with widely varying chemical properties This
project will target the development of the next generation of lightweight inexpensive passive non powered

Conventional procedures for accomplishing this difficult task typically employ numerous steps and generate large quantities of waste. Since the proposed process is based on physical separation (distillation) rather than chemical separation, the problem of poor selectivity that plagues other rare earth separation processes is circumvented. The technical and commercial feasibility of the proposed technology will be investigated according to the following objectives: (1) Optimization of the extraction rate of extraction of metals from magnetic alloys (2) Optimization of the separation of the individual metals from rare earth alloy machining sludge and post-consumer magnets (3) Elaboration of methods for conversion of isolated rare earth compounds into their corresponding oxide and metal forms, and (4) Determination of methods to produce magnetic alloy powders that can be used to fabricate new magnets. Completion of these tasks will remove significant barriers and risks associated with commercialization the proposed technology. It will validate that both extraction and separation and recycling of rare earth elements can be accomplished both facilely and economically."

The militarys mission means that hazards cannot always be predicted since service often occurs in a wide array of uncontrolled environments. The usual first line of defense, area monitoring, is not applicable due to the variable workplace facing the military. Thus, personal dosimeters are required that measure a person's exposure to chemicals by testing the air that the person breathes regardless of location. Since many of potential threats are unpredictable and possibly have never before been identified, it is necessary that a personal dosimeter can gather, store, and stabilize vapors from a broad array of chemical compounds with widely varying chemical properties. Finally, the logistics of obtaining supplies and power, and the requirement for ruggedness impose a definite requirement for a light passive dosimeter that can be attached to a uniform. To meet these requirements, a universal passive dosimeter based on a mesoporous material containing a variety of different surface coatings will be constructed and tested.These materials will selectively trap toxins and only release them with the application of heat.Such universal passive dosimeters will safeguard the health of military personnel and detecting emerging problems before they become critical."

This contamination occurs both from natural and anthropogenic sources such as industrial pollution, arsenical herbicides and pesticides etc. While the levels of the contaminants are sufficiently low to not result in acute poisoning, chronic exposure at levels above those deemed unsafe by the EPA may result in health problems. In particular, young nervous systems are markedly sensitive to heavy metal exposure. Juice purification is extremely challenging since it is a complex blend of nutrients, minerals, flavors, polyphenols, antioxidants, etc. It is very difficult to remove the undesirable species and leave the beneficial ones untouched. The high acidity of juice (e.g. apple juice pH is 3.35 - 4.00 and grape juice pH is 3.4-3.8) also makes purification a challenge since many of the technologies for treating water fail at low pH or result in the dissolution of the sorbents in the juice. Therefore, there is a strong need for novel highly efficient, low-cost, and selective methods for removal of toxic metals and arsenic from juice. Such technologies are the target of this proposal.XploSafe & #39;s proposed technology includes a mineral that exchanges a healthy, beneficial ion (calcium) very selectively for the heavy metal. These mineral have a high capacity for heavy metals. Unlike heavy metals, arsenic is present in juice as inorganic or organic oxides that are usually anionic thus the treatment method must be different. XploSafe has developed a metal oxide/gelatin composite that has high affinity for arsenic (as arsenite, arsenate, methylarsenate, and dimethylarsenate), performs well at pH as low as 3.0, and can be readily synthesized in the form of beads for columns that rapidly remove arsenic from juice.Overall, the proposed solution for removal of heavy metals and arsenic from juice are low-cost, easy to operate, minimize production of undesirable residuals and energy use, and can facilely produce juice that is nutritious and safe for consumption by the public. The proposed research will ensure that the new technologies do not add any foreign or deleterious materials into the juice and that they do not alter the nutrition or quality of the juice. The Phase I research will determine the capacity and rate of uptake of lead, cadmium, and arsenic species from juice and form the basis for scaling to pilot and commercial scale in Phase II (in collaboration with a juice processing company). The product will be extremely beneficial to juice processors, juice packers and juice blenders. Producers and processors of rice products such as brown or white rice, rice cakes, rice milk, rice syrup etc. and producers of baby foods stand to benefit from the proposed technology."

Replicative stress, increased cellular metabolism and exposure to chemotherapeutic agents all contribute to
elevated levels of DNA damage in cancer cells. The base excision repair (BER) pathway corrects damage to
single DNA bases through the action of several enzymes, including the central participant, apurinic/apyrimidinic
endonuclease 1 (APE1). Several studies have demonstrated an association between increased APE1 levels and
enhanced growth, migration, and drug resistance in human tumor cells, as well as with decreased patient survival
overall. To date, APE1 has been implicated in over 20 human cancers, making this enzyme an attractive target
for the development of future anticancer therapies. There are currently no inhibitors of the DNA repair activity of
APE1 in the clinic. A newly developed high-throughput crystallography-based fragment screen has resulted in
high resolution crystal structures of chemical fragments bound to the endonuclease site of APE1. These are the
first experimental 3D structures of APE1 bound to drug-like molecules, thereby resolving a primary bottleneck in
the path to inhibitor development. In this Phase I study, we propose to elaborate these fragment hits into inhibitors
of APE1 through a combination of computational and medicinal chemistry, structural biology, and biochemical
and biophysical assays. Completion of this Phase I proposal will enable a Phase II application to expand the
SAR and optimize the drug-like properties of the lead compound.Tumors often overexpress DNA repair enzymes contributing to disease progression and resistance to available
therapies. We are developing inhibitors against one enzyme involved in DNA repair that has been found
overexpressed in many cancers. Inhibitors may be effective as single agents but could also be used to make
existing therapies more effective."

Â XPRT will build a test-bed representing the characteristics of the AN and will investigate the AN core network model for realizing reservation-based QoS. Â XPRT will then establish a test-bed for the AN, which will enable evaluating and validating the applicability and performance of the techniques that will be developed in the Phase II effort.

Â MLPP based flow control and CAC will be leveraged from XPRTs Comprehensive Edge Solutions Technology (CEST). BENEFIT: The theoretical analyses conducted during this Phase II effort can build foundations for future research and development in the area of QoS, specifically IntServ and DiffServ. For example, studying ARSVP from the angle of exploiting statistical multiplexing for BW savings while meeting QoS expectations, one can develop theoretical boundaries that can be compared to the theoretical boundaries of DiffServ based networks. This approach is in line with DARPAs vision of finding the theoretical boundaries for network protocols to bring our level of analytical understanding of networks to the same level of understanding the boundaries with a single communication channel (e.g., Shannon bound).

The success of this project would provide a technological disruption in the way legal documents are processed. This will result in reduced processing time and financial savings in the review of legal contracts. Moreover, achieving this level of disruption within the legal market has the potential to open the door to automate processing, improve quality, and reduce the cost of many other legal services impacting the entire economy. With a market size of $437 Billion within the US alone, the legal industry is ready for a technological disruption that would bring this market up to par with other industries that have been significantly improved with the adoption of cutting edge Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. This underlines the massive commercial potential for the technology under development. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project pursues a new innovative approach to understanding and analyzing contracts with accuracy comparable to what can be achieved by humans. Regardless of the technology, accuracy is the most important metric for lawyers to trust and adopt this innovation. Standard NLP techniques cannot generate the desired level of accuracy without a new approach to the problem. The approach proposed for this project creates innovative custom-defined rules that operate using standard NLP technologies to break a contract into a data structure capturing different aspects of the contract meaning and allowing a higher level of understanding for the contract. In order to achieve the desired accuracy, a new innovative recurrent neural network (RNN) is designed to learn over the extracted contract-meaning-data-structure which significantly improves the accuracy of the entire system. These two steps form somewhat orthogonal learning processes and when coupled with human-supervised-learning can produce the desired accuracy. This project will allow a full assessment of the underlying technology by training the core engine on a sufficiently large corpus of contracts to test the hypothesis on a larger scale."

How are domain interfaces in low-cost organic photovoltaic materials organized? How do lightweight polymer-based matrix materials fail under strain? X-ray microscopes provide unique capabilities to address these questions, since they have mesoscale spatial resolution and the penetrating power to image materials with real-life thicknesses. One can therefore study soil microbe communities with a thickness equal to that of multiple overlying bacteria; or organic photovoltaics as cast on electrodes and capped with antireflective, anti-oxidative layers. However, organic materials can suffer shrinkage under x-ray irradiation, and hydrated organics such as those in soil microbial communities show severe changes due to radiolytical reactions at the water/organic interface. For these reasons, electron microscopy studies on organic materials are best carried out under cryogenic conditions where radiolysis, mass loss, and shrinkage of organics are minimized. Inspired by this, Xradia has developed the worlds only commercial cryogenic x-ray microscope which provides the same degree of radiation damage resistance as has shown to be essential in electron microscopy. We propose to develop an essential complementary tool for Xradias cryogenic x-ray microscopes: a Cryogenic Correlative Confocal Light Microscope (C3LM). This instrument will allow one to calibrate the new views of materials that x-ray microscopes provide with a view more familiar to most customers and scientific users: that of light microscopy. Because cryogenic sample conditions only halt secondary radiation damage effects (shrinkage; mass loss; bubbling in hydrated specimens) as long as the specimen remains cold, one must carry out light microscopy investigations with a cold sample and one must have the ability to carry out light microscopy after x-ray microscopy when one has cracking at non-pre-determined positions, or after x-ray fluorescence has been used to identify the region in a biofilm where plutonium has been sequestered. The microscope must be confocal for 3D imaging of samples with the thickness that x-ray microscopes can study, for delivering high light concentration to buried photovoltaic interfaces, and for visualizing the distribution of fluorescently-tagged molecules. The C3LM will join two highly complementary, but so far disconnected microscopy techniques together to provide a novel and unified platform for true correlative studies of materials important to the DoE."

Xradia, a US based small business founded in 2000 that has been on the forefront of developing laboratory and synchrotron based 3D x-ray imaging systems, proposes to develop and commercialize thin, Eu doped Lu2O3 scintillators. These scintillators will have excellent stopping power and light yield to address the stringent requirements of next generation of detectors (utilizing high-density scintillators coupled to visible light objectives and CCD cameras) for high-speed, sub-micron x- ray imaging for important applications in the fields of energy generation and storage, semiconductors, security, and many other areas. Fast, high-resolution microscopy can potentially help us answer questions about optimizing the high-speed fuel injection process to improve fuel efficiency and the reduction of pollutants. It can help us understand the time evolution of structural damage to polygranular graphite under irradiation in nuclear reactors. It may also provide insights into foam growth and cell wall stabilization in metallic foams that have many interesting applications in, for example, automotive industry due to their light weight, high strength and stiffness helping improving fuel efficiency, reducing use of metals to improve cost effectiveness and enabling more efficient recycling that reduces environmental damage. Xradia will collaborate with Prof. Sarins pioneering research group at Boston University to optimize the process for the fabrication of thin film scintillation screens using a Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) technique based on magnetron sputtering. The PVD process is advantageious since it is scalable and offers a viable, cost effective, commercial solutions for the production of defect free, high quality scintillators with high yield. One commercialization pathway important to DoE facilities will be the development of scintillation screens, or completely integrated x-ray detector systems targeted for synchrotron and other OEM applications and another will be through Xradias VersaXRM and UltraXRM 3D CT systems. The research product has a straightforward commercialization pathway and, as envisioned, will be the critical component of future x-ray microscopes marketed by Xradia, bringing the benefits to market almost immediately."

In the STTR Phase II project, novel x-ray microscope techniques and software are developed to be able to image samples in three dimensions and determine chemical composition and function on a microscopic level. As known from ubiquitous medical applications, x-rays are able to penetrate and generate images of objects that are opaque to our vision. They can visualize the inside of objects in three dimensions without disturbing or destroying the objectcritical for medical applications. The same advantages hold true at the microscopic scale, well beyond our ability to see things with the naked eye or even a high-powered optical microscope. X-ray microscopes are able to produce images of, for example, microscopic areas inside a battery to directly visualize the chemical processes going on during charging and discharging. Up to now, these were only grey-scale images showing structuremuch like black-and-white TV in the early days. High-powered x-ray sources and new technology developed at National Laboratories now has demonstrated that it is possible to not only show structure, but also put a color that corresponds to the chemical composition or even the chemical state of elements in these 3-D images. In Phase I of the project, it has been demonstrated that it is feasible to develop a robust, commercial solution to bring this color x-ray microscopy to a commercial solution. In Phase II of the project, the demonstrated capabilities will be packaged into a commercial solution that will be available to researchers at Universities, National Laboratories and Industrial Institutions. A new spectroscopic imaging mode with unprecedented sensitivity will be integrated into this solution to offer the capability to for example detect trace contaminants in soil samples and identify how they associate spatially with soil constituents. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The developed product is expected to have high impact in many current focus-areas of research. In particular, in the development and optimization of energy storage and conversion devices (batteries, fuel cells, etc.), water purification (membranes), and catalytic reactions to name only a few. The unique insight x-ray microscopes deliver in terms of understanding the structure, hierarchical organization and elemental/chemical interactions enables the design of targeted experimentation with an understanding of the detailed nano-scale mechanisms."

While commercial solutions (x-ray micro-tomography) already exist to obtain the high resolution 3-D images, these images only show a grey-scale mass density representation of the sample. No information about which compounds and elements the sample is made out of is available. The research focuses on demonstrating the ability to add an x-ray fluorescence capability to the x-ray imaging to unambiguously identify the elemental makeup with very high ultimate sensitivity (parts per million) with a focus on correlating exactly the elemental measurement with the location in the 3-D x-ray image of the sample. There is a growing need for this complementary capability both in the academic research area and in industrial use for targeted applications. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable the development of more energy efficient and environmentally friendly extraction and processing techniques for the natural resource sector. The first set of customers, directly contributing to the research by providing relevant samples and helping in defining the ultimate system requirements and specifications, come from the mining R & D and industrial market segment. These customers have adopted high-resolution x-ray imaging very rapidly in the past few years, realizing the inherent advantage of imaging ore samples at various stages during the process of extracting and purifying the valuables. While this capability is already helping to develop better, more efficient extraction processes, an analytical capability to get elemental and chemical information is becoming essential for continued progress. Obvious benefits from the availability of the new technology will be energy savings in the extraction processes by increasing efficiency and better use of available resources by not allowing valuables to enter the waste stream. As an indirect consequence, this leads long term to lower commodity prices and a general higher living standard.

In this project, Xradia Inc. and SLAC are partnering to develop these new spectroscopic capabilities into a commercial grade solution through: 1) development of an integrated, fully automated command and data interface between the TXM-Wizard and the Xradia control software. This will significantly increase the productivity of the TXM and allow non-experts, including industry users, to routinely access the advanced imaging modes; 2) optimize the TXM control system for the data rates made possible by advanced synchrotron sources to enable quick imaging for improved in-situ, real time studies of energy materials; and 3) incorporate a fully integrated scanning fluorescence mode into the TXM with an analysis area below 1 micrometer an ppm sensitivity. This will allow correlations between the structural/ chemical information obtained on majority elements within a sample in the transmission imaging mode of the TXM and trace elements which can only be observed using x-ray fluorescence. The new capabilities will greatly enhance not only SLACs ability to answer national energy needs and deliver on the DOE mission but also that of the other DOE hard x-ray user facilities developing x-ray microscopy facilities.

Thus, the development of a platform that allows automation, miniaturization and parallelization for obtaining crystals of optimal quality would be a significant step forward in crystallography and would accelerate structural studies. An improvement in this area would therefore be of interest not only to academic scientists engaged in structural studies, but also to pharmaceutical researchers who are interested in the structural relationship of drugs and their targets."

In combination with r
ecently available high brightness microfocus x-ray sources, it could increase the throughput of many x-ray techniques up to 10 times and reduce initial tool purchase cost and subsequent maintenance cost. For the proposing company, we plan to use it in our
x-ray 3D imaging systems with sub-30 nm resolution, including a prototype 3D imaging system developed under a NIH phase II funding, which is optimized for imaging biological samples at 30nm resolution. The combination of this performance improvement and lo
wer cost will help to make the tool widely deployed in biological laboratories. 3D x-ray imaging of cells, cell clusters and tissues at 30nm resolution has the potential to open new insights into the organization, evolution and connectivity of biological s
ystems and naturally complements the already available toolset for biological researchers. The Wolter capillary mirror will also substantially improve the performance of many other well established, relevant x-ray techniques, including protein crystallogra
phy for determination of crystallographic structures of proteins and viruses, and small angle scattering for studying biological macromolecules in native solution both in vitro and in vivo, which are important tools for drug development and the understandi
ng of disease. Similar to that for x-ray microscopy, a throughput gain of 10X may be expected for some specific applications in these other x-ray techniques. During the phase II project, we plan to refine our fabrication processes and improve our metrology
 capability to allow the fabrication of Wolter capillary lenses with a point spread function better than 1 ltm. Project Narrative Successful development of the proposed Wolter mirror optic will make 3-D x-ray microscopy for biological applications more pow
erful, affordable, and practical by reducing image acquisition times from several hours to tens of minutes (approximately 10X throughput gain). Exciting capabilities include in-situ 3D imaging of cell and tissue specimens with 30 nm resolution that have un
dergone little morphological and functional change from their natural living state. In addition to 3-D x-ray imaging other x-ray techniques, such as x-ray diffraction and small angle scattering, critical to drug discovery and understanding of disease, can
expect a similar throughput increase from this development."

X-ray protein crystallography is the single most useful tool to determine macromolecule structures such as proteins, especially for molecular weights above about 30kD. Recently, soft x-ray cryo-microscopy has been demonstrated to offer non-destructive high resolution three dimensional tomographic imaging of single biological cells with a resolution of about 25 nm in 2-D and 60 nm in 3-D. Important trace elements in a biological specimen such as a cell or tissue can be mapped with sensitivity better than parts per billion at a spatial resolution of about 100 nm using a synchrotron based x-ray fluorescence microscope developed by the PI and his colleagues at Argonne National Laboratory. We propose to develop a 'fast' x-ray lens that will drastically improve the performance of all the x-ray techniques described above, which are limited by the currently available x-ray lenses.

More efficient use of the fuel, which is the largest cost in a cement plan, can result in lower cost and more efficient operations. Another benefit of using the equipment is to lower overall emissions. The impact of this technology goes beyond just cement operations. Any operation burning extensive amount of fossil fuels can benefit from this technology due to the impact on cost, efficiently, and emissions."

Cement manufacturing is highly energy-intensive, accounting for a significant portion of fuel use in the world. The rising cost of energy has motivated cement manufacturers to use alternative fuels available at low or no cost (e.g., tires, municipal waste etc.). However, the use of alternative fuels creates manufacturing problems due to the lack of adequate and timely analysis feedback. In this project, a Rapid Clinker Analyzer (RCA) will be designed, built and evaluated to demonstrate that the system captures and analyzes data in a much faster and cost-effective manner to allow cement manufacturers to analyze product clinker in near-real time. The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to significantly increase the use of alternative fuels in cement manufacturing. Widespread adoption of this technology will result in significant savings to cement manufacturers, while greatly reducing the use of fossil fuels. In addition, the shift to alternative fuels will reduce landfills, and thus mitigate negative environmental impacts of waste products. This new technology will also provide a unique advancement in analyzer technology because of the more rapid performance and smaller sample required."

Whereas high-purity germanium (HpGe) detectors provide outstanding resolution in a variety of applications, from scientific research to homeland security, their high cost and relatively low count rate limits widespread adoption. Our objective is to develop a self-optimizing digital spectrometer based on the use of lower-resolution detectors. In specific applications, this technology will deliver a level of performance that is equivalent to HpGe detectors, but at lower cost and better elemental and compound detectability per unit of scan time. Phase I will involve the development of algorithms to extract all the information content (i.e. the entire shape function) from the more diffuse spectra provided by the low-resolution detectors. The shape functions include the photopeaks, u esolved photopeaks and Compton scattered gamma rays. These new algorithms will then be tested and evaluated to determine the performance of the system. Phase II will complete the design and build the digital electronics. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project results from the ability to use lower resolution detectors to deliver performance similar to higher resolution detectors. This new capability would enable new applications that previously were not viable, or significantly reduce the cost of detection in applications that were prohibitively expensive. Potential applications include: (1) lower cost, faster explosive detection equipment; (2) lower cost and better screening of cargo containers; (3) improved Radiation Portal Monitors (RPM) for spectroscopy analysis - lower resolution sodium iodide (or other) detectors could be used to deliver higher performance; (4) improved, lower-cost hand-held radiation detectors. Because high resolution detectors often are used in these systems, the equipment is very expensive and, in some cases, the data collection rates are slow. The use of lower cost and faster detectors can significantly improve the cost effectiveness of these systems. From a commercial standpoint, a number of markets can benefit from this low cost, high performance technology, including markets related to defense, homeland security, and scientific instrumentation. From a homeland security standpoint, for a given DHS budget, more cargo screening systems could be supplied with advanced cargo scanning equipment."

Cement manufacturing is an energy-intensive process that accounts for 6-8% of the world's fuel use. Despite 90% of fuel use occurring in the kiln, no real-time method currently exists for monitoring the elemental composition of the kiln output, known as clinker. Cement manufacturers have indicated that better kiln control would significantly reduce costs, improve quality, and increase profitability. The challenge is to extract the 1400 degrees Celsius clinker quickly, and analyze it within minutes of leaving the kiln. To deliver this performance, a bulk measurement technology widely used in cement manufacturing called Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation will be used, but with major modifications. In order to do this, an analysis time of 1-2 minute is required, based on 1/200th of a typical sample volume. The challenges are significant, and success would represent a major breakthrough. The commercial potential of this project will be the reduction of fuel consumption and harmful emissions in the cement industry. Estimates that widespread adoption of this technology will result in equivalent fuel savings from 150 - 600 million barrels of oil per year. In addition to fuel savings, cement manufacturing emits 3.4% of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). When the kiln manufacturing process is working optimally, maximum amounts of sulfur, potassium, and other elements are absorbed into the cement, instead of being volatilized and released with the emitted gasses. As a result, this project has the potential to significantly reduce GHG. From a commercial standpoint, the concept for this product was identified as a top priority by some of the world's largest cement manufacturers. The resulting product will be unique due to the use of a smaller sample size and the faster analysis time. Unlike most other measurement approaches, this technology would be amenable to implementation through a pipe, thereby representing an entirely new product category. As such, it should be useful for many different applications and industries such as petroleum manufacturing, power plants, waste recovery, and any industry that can benefit from real-time elemental measurements through pipes."

Current checkpoint X-ray security systems have limitations because they provide only a transmission image of the object being screened, whereas a 3D image would provide much more relevant information. A reasonably priced Laminography system has not been implemented due to the unavailability of a reasonably-priced X-ray source with suitable performance. This proposed solution overcomes the limitations of current X-ray sources. By employing a dual-grid dual-cathode source, it is possible to produce a low-cost X-ray source that delivers the cost and performance required for a low-cost high performance 3D Laminography-based checkpoint system. Broader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is based on the development of suitable X-ray component technology that can be used to upgrade the checkpoint security systems to 3D capabilities at reasonable prices. The impact is improved security at the checkpoints. The commercial potential comes from the potential to upgrade several thousand checkpoints with this capability. Although current aviation security checkpoints provide a strong line of defense, terrorists continue to analyze and exploit any weaknesses in these defenses. For this reason, it is critical to continually improve the security checkpoints and security screening equipment, in order to ensure that terrorists are not able to defeat these systems. In addition to improving the security at airport checkpoints, the new source can be used to upgrade any Xray based security system and to improve the performance of conventional Computed Tomography systems. The X-ray source will be unique and can be used in a broad range of fields that includes medical imaging, non-destructive testing, X-ray fluorescence, and so forth"

As many new immuno-oncology (IO) therapies for cancer are developed, oncologists will be faced with the
challenge of choosing from hundreds of drugs with thousands of potential combinations to treat their patients.
Xsphera Biosciences Inc. (XB) believes one solution to this challenge lies in a novel combination of a tumor
processing method that produces patient-derived organotypic tumor spheroids (PDOTS) and a microfluidic
device that preserves the tumor microenvironment of a patientâs tumor. XB aims to develop the PDOTS platform
to 1) provide oncologists with data-driven treatment options for their patients and 2) provide biopharmaceutical
companies with data that will de-risk IND initiation by reliably predicting patient clinical responses to IO and
chemotherapeutic drugs. One of the key actions needed is a systematic evaluation and optimization of the
different classes of immunotherapeutic drugs in the platform. These classes include, but are not limited to, tumor
cell-targeted IgG1 antibodies (tumor-targeted Abs), checkpoint inhibitors, gene therapy, and cell therapy
including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T).
This project aims to establish the parameters to test tumor-targeted Ab therapeutics in the Xsphera platform and,
using cetuximab in colorectal cancer (CRC), confirm that the efficacy of cetuximab aligns with the historical
clinical experience.
Specific Aim 1 will characterize the effects of cetuximab on CRC PDOTS in the Xsphera platform and determine
if the ex vivo responses in RAS wild type (RASwt) and RAS mutant tumors (RASmut) are consistent with those
reported in the clinic. Cetuximab is indicated for RASwt but has shown no efficacy in tumors with RASmut.The
immune activation in the PDOTS induced by cetuximab will be characterized, and the cytokine and gene
expression profiles for immune activation and apoptosis will be measured and correlated with cytotoxicity data.
Specific Aim 2 will characterize the kinetics of Ab-mediated immune activation to establish the optimal time to
monitor cytotoxicity and immune activation signals. Using the dose of cetuximab that induced the highest level
of cytotoxicity, the kinetics of Ab mediated cytotoxicity and immune modulation will be characterized during the
first 3 days after Ab treatment. The timepoint with the highest cytotoxicity and immune modulatory signals and
the lowest variability between replicates and between patients will support standardization on the timepoint for
cetuximab treatment. Specific Aim 2 will further characterize the immune involvement by mAb neutralization of
known immune effector mechanisms, including NK cells, CTL cells and the complement cascade.
Results of Phase I will confirm whether clinically approved cetuximab is effective in the platform by quantifying
cytotoxicity and characterizing immune activation and whether it aligns with historical clinical response data and
for being restricted to RASwt.NARRATIVE
As many new oncology therapies for cancer are developed, oncologists will be faced with the challenge of
choosing from hundreds of drugs with thousands of potential combinations to treat their patients. To address this
challenge, Xsphera Biosciences Inc. aims to develop a platform to reliably predict patient clinical responses to
immuno-oncology, targeted, and chemotherapeutic drugs to guide treatment decisions for individual patients. In
the proposed project, the Xsphera platform will be validated and optimized to enable the platform to move closer
towards commercialization in clinical settings as well as in the assessment and development of preclinical
experimental therapeutics."

Through precise control of the metallic grain size at nanometer length scales, this technology can create coatings with precisely tailored properties. These properties are generally very favorable, and new properties and suites of properties can be achieved in alloy streams where they were not previously accessible. Xtalic has to date focused on optimizing the technology to produce hare, abrasion-resistant metal coating.
  The current dominant hard metal coating technology is hard chromium. These coatings have favorable properties, but require the use of hexavalen chromium, a known carcinogen, as a precursor material. In addition, the dynamic, high-volume barrel processes commonly used for other industrial electroplating applications cannot be effectively applied for hard chromium due to the low current efficiency of the process. As a result, the processing of large numbers of parts with hard chromium is labor intensive and often economically infeasible.
  Xtalic can produce coatings with properties that match or exceed those of current hard chromium coatings for many applications, without the use of hexavalent chromium. In the current work, Xtalic will extend this technology to use in dynamic high-volume barreling techniques. In particular, Xtalic will focus on evaluating the feasibility of current waveform control on millisecond timescales for such processes, and of correlating the results of its existing static process with those of this new dynamic processes. The successful completion of this project will provide a new technology to replace current hard chromium coatings that (i) has significantly reduced environmental and worker exposure concerns (ii) has substantially reduced costs due to reduced labor requirements and (iii) produces coatings with superior in-service performance."

Widespread use of scintillators as gamma-ray detectors is largely generated by their extensive availability and tunable properties, such high light output, high stopping power (Zeff), fast decay time, and good proportionality. Additionally, the cost for manufacturing a scintillation detector like NaI:Tl is usually considerably lower than the cost for manufacturing a semiconductor detector like CdZnTe. Because there is no one ideal scintillation material, an application requiring certain detection characteristics may incorporate a scintillator tailored to its specific properties. The vast variety of applications and requirements necessitates more research into new scintillation materials and/or better methods of producing existing materials. The goal of this project is to grow low cost and environmentally stable inorganic transparent ceramic scintillators with excellent gamma ray resolution, excellent energy proportionality, excellent detection efficiency due to high density (>5 g/cm3) and very high Zeff (55-80), and good light yields (>40,000 ph/MeV). We will develop low cost and environmentally stable highly efficient inorganic transparent ceramic scintillators of various dimensions by hot uniaxial pressing and investigate their scintillation properties in comparison to the single crystal counterpart. Inorganic transparent ceramic scintillators produced in this project will enhance cost effectiveness at instrument level based on low projected cost of proposed compounds as much smaller crystal sizes would be required to achieve similar efficiency as current radioisotope identification devices (RIIDâs) used in homeland security applications as well as spectrometers in high energy physics applications."

 importantly, allowing advanced designs to be fully integrated over an array of
 parallel targets. This project will combine Xtrana's proprietary metal oxides
 with the self-assembled, nanofabrication technology of Sandia National
 Laboratory (SNL) to create microscale frits that irreversibly bind nucleic
 acids. The DNA and RNA can then be enzymatically amplified while on the
 surface, without the inefficiencies and complexities of elution. The
 operational and multiplexing capabilities associated with these frits are key
 to routine, multi-target diagnostics. This project is a model collaboration
 between Xtrana's materials and molecular diagnostics expertise and SNL's
 innovative self-assembly methods to create membranes and other structures
 containing ordered arrays of nanoscale, metal oxide pores. Phase II will
 further develop and test the materials in advanced microfluidic devices to
 identify infectious agents and cellular polymorphisms."

Two complementary approaches will be taken to achieve this objective. Suitable dopant elements such as phosphorous will be added to create a heavily doped p-type layer before applying the back contact. The heavy doping will create an electron reflector and facilitate a hole-conducting semiconductor or metal contact. The second pathway will involve magnetron sputter deposition of suitable p-type semiconductors such as ZnTe doped with nitrogen or copper. Preliminary studies have shown promise with thick CdTe layers and CdTe crystals. This project will extend the studies to ultra-thin, semitransparent CdTe solar cells to validate the efficacy of either or both approaches as applied to PV window structures. The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide an improved back-contact interface for semitransparent photovoltaic windows, which will help move these power-producing windows toward 10% efficiency while maintaining good transparency. The estimated annual market for curtain-wall glass applications in the U.S. is about 150 million square feet (14 million square meters).

Output power of these lasers is limited by the lowest damage threshold of their optical components that is usually attributed to the ICs. Therefore, ultra-high intensity high average power femtosecond laser sources critically rely on superior performance of ICs for maximum power extraction. However, when exposed to intense femtosecond pulses, the coatings damage at a fluence below 1 J/cm2. XUV Lasers Inc. in collaboration with the Ohio State University (OSU), University of New Mexico (UNM) and Colorado State University (CSU), proposes a combined modeling and experimental effort to develop high damage threshold ultrafast ICs beyond state of the art. In Phase I, we extended the Gruzdev model of laser damage of wide bandgap materials to describe the interaction with ultrabroad bandwidth ultrashort pulses. We also included field ionization, plasma and propagation effects to create a dynamic finite difference time domain (FDTD) model for 1D for multilayer stacks. The simulation results of bi- and quad-layers IC convincingly show laser damage depends on pulse duration, pointing towards importance of the extensive modeling framework that is needed to capture and enhance the understanding of the whole process, so that we can design and construct higher damage threshold optics. The Phase II effort will expand the model framework to multi-time-scale multi-physics 2D, capturing field-ionization, temperature evolution and hydrodynamics while incorporating critical microscopic material parameters that are unknown for the disordered amorphous oxides more accurately through theory and experimentation. These modifications will significantly enhance the predictive capabilities of the model to capture the failure of IC systems under ultra-broadband ultrashort pulse laser irradiation more accurately. A close interaction with the coating and fabrication effort will enable us to build a robust, predictive framework for IC damage at femtosecond time scales. This iterative process will be key to optimize the performance of IC beyond state-of-the-art. The focus of the Phase II effort on growth, characterization and modeling of laser/matter interaction will be on ICs for high average power ultrafast lasers operating in the 0.8-2 ï­m range. The outcome of this Phase II will be ICs with beyond state-of-the- art performance that XUV Lasers will commercialize. Interference coatings demonstrate a solid performance for low-fluence narrow-bandwidth lasers but fail dramatically when tested with ultrashort pulses because of their large bandwidth. This challenge coupled with a scarce supplier market open up enticing commercial opportunities. Ultrafast coatings with superior laser damage performance will advance the engineering of high average power femtosecond lasers for next-gen accelerator-type applications. If realized, they can create a $50 million/year high power-million to billion shot optics market for laser-based accelerators in scientific and medical markets. Considering the growing investments in high average power femtosecond lasers, the proposed efforts will enable the United States to remain competitive in this critical technology."

They enable the generation of high energy density relativistic plasmas, bright x-ray and gammaâray bursts, energetics particle beams and neutrons, and drive applications such as shadowgraphy of inertial confinement fusion targets and fast ignition. However, all ultrahigh power lasers are presently limited to low repetition rates (less than 10 Hz). XUV Lasers, in collaboration with Colorado State University (CSU) proposes to develop and commercialize key components for Petawatt-class lasers operating at greatly increased repetition rates. Building on the results of Phase I we propose to develop a multi-Joule, kW average power Yb:YAG-based green laser module to pump high average power Ti:Sappire (Ti:Sa) lasers by frequency doubling kW average power beams in LBO, and to demonstrate a thermal management solution for multi-Joule high rep rate (>100 Hz) Ti:Sa amplifiers. The XUV Lasers/CSU partnership is well positioned to conduct the proposed development: XUV Lasers has developed cryo-cooled diode-pumped Yb-YAG amplifier technology that will serve as a basis for the proposed green laser development, and CSU had demonstrated one of the highest repetition rate Petawatt-class lasers to date (0.85 PW, 3.3 Hz). The realization and commercialization of high repetition rate ultra-intense laser amplifiers will have transformative potential in both fundamental science and technology. The ability to gather data at high repetition rates can transform the fields of high energy density science and ultra-high filed physics in which experiments are typically limited to a relatively low number of events and poor statistics. High repetition rate lasers will open the possibility of exploring broad parameter spaces and reducing measurement uncertainties, resulting in high quality data that can serve to benchmark and improve simulations, helping to distinguish between competing models. The commercial availability of high repetition rate lasers can also help to greatly extend the capability of mid-scale high intensity laser facilities, such as those that are part the LaserNetUS, a users network of high power lasers created by DOE to serve the broad scientific community. The unprecedented combination of ultra-high intensity, high energy, and high repetition rate will also enable the implementation of new technologies such as bright ultrafast x-ray, gamma ray, and neutron sources and compact electron and ion accelerators for medicine and materials inspection, while the proposed pump laser modules will also have industrial applications such laser pinning of critical mechanical components."

The CSU team has the capability to grow high quality ICs by ion beam sputtering. OSU and XUV Lasers can test laser damage performance over a broad range of wavelengths (0.26 to 4.2 mm) and pulse widths from a few femtosecond to picoseconds. In Phase I, the models will be used to predict laser damage performance of IC for 0.8 and 1.03 mm wavelengths and for pulse durations of 10 fs, 100 fs and 5 ps. The model predictions will guide IC design and fabrication. The results of laser damage tests will enable benchmarking and refining of the models. The output of this iterative process will be ICs of superior laser damage performance. The results of Phase I will enable us to formulate a cohesive plan for Phase II focused on modeling and experiment of ultrafast, ultra-broad band ICs for laser wavelengths up to 2 mm and pulse duration down to a few femtoseconds.ICs are a proven established technology for comparatively low fluence, narrow bandwidth near infrared lasers.However, ICs fail dramatically when tested with ultrashort pulses.

The focus of this research is the development of circuitry and signal processing and control algorithms that would effectively address impairments experienced in a complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) implementation of a novel DAC topology designed to accommodate ultra-wide bandwidths. While the CMOS fabrication process may be tailored for digital processors and memory, it is a most challenging environment for the design of high-performance, wide dynamic range analog circuitry. The solutions being developed essentially provide the DAC with ?self-healing? capabilities that allow it to overcome inevitable impairments such as device mismatches, non-linearities, and timing misalignments. Preliminary results indicate the validity of the proposed architectures and approaches and it is anticipated that a fabrication-ready design will result from the Phase 1 research. The involvement of researchers and PhD candidates from academia in this research allows them exposure into most challenging research topics that are of great interest to the semiconductor industry. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in allowing ultra-high-performance data-conversion capabilities to be integrated into low-cost CMOS system-on-chip (SoC) solutions that are widely used in commercial applications of various types ranging from communications and multimedia to instrumentation. In particular, the technology being developed will allow for the integration and low-cost realization of this most critical function in a true SDR. The proposed innovation, targeting the self-sufficient-compensation for the effects of inevitable impairments, such as fabrication-process variations, mismatches, non-linearities, and timing misalignments, through the employment of novel built-in calibration and compensation circuitry and algorithms, will allow integrated DACs to deliver ultra-high performance (e.g., 16-bit resolution at rates above 10GHz) without requiring costly testing at fabrication, production-yield losses, laser trimming, or any other consequence of traditional design and manufacturing of high-performance analog integrated circuits. The approach to be developed has a broader impact on chip manufacturing, as these impairments represent limiting factors in other functions as well. As an enabling technology, the proposed innovation can potentially greatly increase the size of the existing market for data converters, currently at $3B, and allow for various new consumer applications where wide bandwidths of operation are needed and cost is a constraint."

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in extending the useful life of the existing in-ground copper infrastructure, thus allowing equipment providers to continue to focus their resources on delivering ever-increasing bandwidths, while also offsetting the high expense of new fiber deployment. Benefits are also realized through the company?s partnerships with universities, where the company works closely with key faculty and with students, provides seminars, and has an ongoing internship program that results in the full-time hiring of graduates. According to publicly available reports, mobile data traffic in North America is expected to increase by a factor of over 20 by the year 2015. This massive increase in data consumption, brought on primarily by the rapid adoption of smart-phones and bandwidth-intensive applications, is already placing an enormous burden on the backhaul infrastructure, which carries telecommunications for cellular, internet and landline voice traffic. Resolution of the bandwidth congestion requires significant improvement in telecom infrastructure including backhaul and access, both of which are largely copper-based in North America. The company?s interference-mitigation technology will address this problem in a cost-effective manner by allowing the growing demand for bandwidth to be satisfied with the existing infrastructure."

The performance in the multi-twister-pair channels is limited by crosstalk and interference caused by various sources in their noisy environment. The technology to be developed in this Phase I project offers significant increases in throughput through cost-effective interference-mitigation mechanisms. The company?s key innovation is in low-latency dynamic interference cancellation algorithms, which greatly enhance system performance while maintaining acceptable implementation complexity. The project will involve both research and development at the algorithmic level, as well as system implementation challenges associated with the minimization of the system?s cost and power consumption. More specifically, the innovation includes novel approaches to training-sequence design and numerically-robust schemes for the mitigation of both self-induced crosstalk as well as unpredictable crosstalk originating from other systems sharing the cable of twisted pairs (alien interference). Based on preliminary results, it is anticipated that this technology will offer critically needed throughput enhancements ranging from a factor of 2 to a factor of 5, depending on the operating scenario. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project would be in enabling low-cost broadband services to a greater part of the population and thus also in fostering remote education, telecommuting and e-commerce. About 80% of the cell towers in the US utilize copper twisted-pairs for their backhaul, and the equipment market, valued at $5.6B in 2009, is expected to grow to $11.2B by 2013 due to deployment of bandwidth-intensive smart-phones and cellular Internet offerings. Hence, the relevant market sectors directly impacted are chip and communications equipment manufacturing. Many new micro-cells and femto-cells, offering wireless access in a coverage area smaller than that of a typical cell tower, are being deployed to offer wireless broadband coverage while relying on cooper-based backhaul. The copper infrastructure typically suffers capacity limitations and is interference-dominated while the higher-capacity alternatives, fiber and microwave, are costly and slow to deploy. The interference-mitigation technology enabling this breakthrough, developed in collaboration with the University of Texas at Dallas, may be applicable in other multi-channel communication systems, and can serve, for example, to better utilize scarce wireless spectrum."

In particular, the technology being developed offers advantages in interference-dominated and in suburban/rural environments. In the USA alone there are many millions of households that are currently out-of-reach of broadband access, where there are typically multiple copper landlines available, and the global demand for such solution is significantly higher. For these underserved subscribers, this innovative extended-reach solution represents the only low-cost broadband access alternative to costly, inefficient satellite coverage. While existing Digital-Subscriber-Line (DSL) solutions are not specified to provide broadband access at very long distances, the company?s novel solution greatly increases the achievable distances and allows broadband rates (1Mbps) to be delivered at extended ranges, as demonstrated in Phase 1 of this project. The technology combines innovative signal-processing algorithms with novel digital implementation architectures to allow for high-performance reduced-complexity and low current-consumption implementations. The broader impact and commercial potential of this project are in enabling affordable broadband service to the many households, which are currently out of the reach of broadband access, and in enhancing the performance of other copper-based applications. The technology will enable telco providers to better compete in areas where cable service exists, and can enhance existing solutions for copper-based backhaul, thereby helping service providers with the growing problem of backhaul bottlenecks associated with increased wireless traffic. The growing demand for solutions of this type has the potential to generate annual revenues on the order of $50M, representing a great business opportunity.

Tracer enables stakeholders and engineers to identify bidirectional impacts of changes to requirements or system code.Xwing is currently developing capabilities for detect-and-avoid (DAA) for autonomous aircraft, and deriving and generating requirements based on DO-365. Those requirements were used as a Phase I test case for Tracer. The use case scope focused on tracking for detection of threats. The use case served to collect valuable usability experience and information, gather feedback and improve Tracer functionality.The work in Phase I was performed along two main workstreams: 1) development of the requirements tracing tool, and 2) refinement through implementation of a DAA use case. Phase II will continue these workstreams, and add a third : development of a framework for certification of AI-based systems. These certification frameworks will be applied to vision-based DAA, expanding on conventional deterministic DAA previously explored.The current certification process for avionics is not adapted to complex algorithms and to ldquo;AI-basedrdquo; algorithms such as deep neural networks used in vision-based DAA. Despite their lack of explainability such algorithms can exhibit high performance. Xwing recognizes that such algorithms will enable the automation of functions where human judgement was previously necessary. It may also reduce the size, weight, and power required by some sensors.

Tracer accomplishes this by:a) leveraging modern software development best practices such as version control and review process for all artifacts in the process (requirements, test cases, etc., in addition to code)b) allowing for the entire process to exist within a single tool and platform that builds off of the the git-based systems that engineers already use for development.Taking the form of a lightweight addin for git, the tool facilitates generation of reports, generation of requirements traceability matrices, visualization of dependency trees, and various enforcements of dependencies and links. The enforcements are especially powerful in easing entry into the world of certified aerospace systems for new entrants to the industry. There are also extensive capabilities to enable rich and transparent cloud-based collaboration, enabling strong links between customers, regulators, performers, and other stakeholders.Current practices use separate often expensive tools for each part of the chain, with significant costly and error-prone manual overhead required in creating and maintaining links.

A variety of illuminator technologies will be investigated, and compared to requirements derived from analyses of the underwater imaging application, and from platform properties. The illuminator technologies to beinvestigated include emitter technology, pulse power technology, and optical beam projection technology including the capabilities for varying the beam divergence (zoom). We will focus on new and emerging technologies such as Frequency Doubled DiodePumped Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (SHG DP-VCELS), and Electrically Pumped Two Triode Organic Lasers (TTOLs) such as the Tetracence TTOL (TcubedOL). Other candidates will be sought as well.The major advantage of this approach is to be able toilluminate underwater objects from unmanned platforms. A secondary advantage is that the sources will be low cost. A tertiary advantage is that the beam will be zoomable, allowing adaptation of the illumination to allow deeper water penetration. The useon unmanned platforms allows these systems to used in a RPV, the low cost feature allows the imaging to be performed from expendable platforms, and zoom is an additional feature that allows the platform altitude or water penetration depth to be adjusted asnecessary. Thus applications such as search and rescue, airborne reconnaissance, imaging for surveillance and security, (coastal through fog), and many others would be feasible."

The system uses a hybrid laser which is composed of a Nd:YAG and a Cr:LiSAF laser rod in the same flash lamp pump cavity. Since the absorption bands for the two rods are different, the flash lamp light is much better utilized and the laser system can be much more efficient. In addition, simultaneous output occurs. Rapid, electrically controlled tuning of the Cr:LiSAF laser is achieved through the use of a novel electro-optically tuned Solc filter. Harmonic and sum frequency generation, which is dispersively phase match tuning-compensated, results in output wavelengths from the UV to IR."

optimization system for clinicians to treat and prevent chronic conditions such as diabetic ulceration and
malalignment. The proposed system leaps beyond the traditional orthotics production process, as it
allows clinicians to directly and conveniently acquire patientsandapos; 3D foot structure from any needed
postures (either weight bearing, non-bearing, or partial weight bearing), provides comprehensive details
on patientsandapos; foot biomechanics, and optimizes orthotics design through finite element analysis. The
proposed system also allows localized testing and refitting through a 3D printer, facilitating comfort
orthotics design and thus improving the compliance issue faced today.The proposed solution will have the following impact and significance: facilitate effective
prevention of the recurrence of diabetic foot ulcers; better foot orthotics customization experience; more
comfort fit leading to better compliance; and lower treatment cost.Diabetic foot complications are common and costly problem. Approximately 30.3 million
Americans, 9.4 percent of the U.S. population have diabetes, according to the American Academy of
Orthotists and Prosthetists. In adults over age 60, about 1 in 4 have diabetes. With the aging population,
this group is expected to grow at least 7% per year for the next 10 years. Custom foot orthotics are
commonly used to treat and prevent the recurrence of foot diabetics. Undoubtedly, the development of a
low cost and ubiquitous mobile platform based foot orthotics optimization and rapid prototyping method
will have significant impact on the elderlies especially for the low and middle income sufferers.Project NarrativeThe proposed mobile solution to be developed under this SBIR project will be the first
clinical tool that utilizes a mobile device to capture detailed foot 3D shape dynamics for in-office
customization and rapid prototyping of foot orthotics. The unique data acquisition and
optimization framework has many advantages over existing practice in the podiatric industry.
We foresee the proposed solution will have a reasonably large market share in the rapidly
growing multi-billion dollar foot ulceration care industry due to the growing aging population."

 We propose in this SBIR effort to develop a smartphone or tablet based app for caregivers to
perform non invasive and quantitative measurements of patientsandapos chronic wounds especially on diabtetic
foot ulcers either at care facilities or at patientsandapos home Since chronic wounds take months or even
longer to heal it is highly likely that more and more patients will be discharged early from the hospitals
To follow up with the wound healing progress outpatients must routinely visit clinicians for a long period
of time in order to have their wound healing progress assessed In addition current wound assessment
methods mostly provide information with poor accuracy and are invasive The lack of precise wound data
makes it difficult for clinicians to track subtle wound changes thus hindering the correct assessment of
the treatment effectiveness The proposed software technology will be the first reported to offer precise
wound measurement as well as analysis capabilities on mobile platforms It will provide great benefit to
chronic wound patients by providing a low cost effective and personalized care solution With its unique
framework and many advantages over existing methods the proprietary technology can be easily
applied to the benefit of diagnosis and treatment on other type of wounds and diseases such as burns
acute wounds battle wounds and tumor irradiation treatment It also has substantial potential for
improving access to emergency care in any remote regions With the ability of diagnosis and treatment
remotely we expect that our technology will completely change the landscape of the multi billion dollar
wound care market
 There are approximately million patients in the U S suffering from chronic wounds such as
diabetic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers and approximately patients hospitalized every year with
new wounds The burden of treating chronic wounds is also growing rapidly due to increasing health
care costs an aging population and a sharp rise in the incidence of diabetes and obesity worldwide It is
claimed that an excess of $  billion is spent annually on the treatment of chronic wounds Undoubtedly
the development of a mobile platform based D wound assessment tool is significant and will provide a
much needed solution Project Narrative
 The proposed mobile app to be developed under this SBIR project will provide clinicians
a convenient yet comprehensive diagnosis and measurement tool empowering them to provide
personalized and timely care for chronic ulcer sufferers such as diabetic foot ulcers With its

Fish raised through aquaculture can meet the rapidly growing demand for seafood while improving diets. Aquaculture is the fastest growing sector of the world's food production. It is expanding 6 times faster than beef production, 2.6 times faster than egg production and 1.7 times faster than poultry production throughout the world. This is good news because fish can turn feed into body mass much more efficiently than poultry, pork or beef, and they are highly nutritious. The polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish are not found in any other major food group and are essential for brain and nerve development - particularly for children and the elderly.Unfortunately, aquaculture depends heavily on the use of fishmeal to cultivate the species most desired by consumers. In essence, it is necessary to feed fish to fish in order to make food for humans. Conventional aquaculture requires about 4.5 lb of fishmeal to make 1 lb of farmed fish. It is possible to substitute vegetable protein for most of the essential amino acids for fish cultivation, but the nutritionally critical Ï3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (Ï3 LC-PUFAs) largely come from fishmeal, which places additional pressures on global marine species and ecosystems. Conventional aquaculture based on fishmeal does not really solve the problem of providing sustainable protein for human consumption. By creating vegetable-based feedstocks that supply long chain (LC) PUFAs, the work proposed here will relieve pressure on native fisheries and increase aquaculture sustainability.Yeast protein comes close to satisfying the essential amino acids for fish. Feeds with high levels of yeast amino acids along with Ï3-LCPUFAs could well serve this growing market. One potential feedstock for making yeast-based aquaculture feeds comes from the grain ethanol industry. Some of the largest sources of vegetable protein in the United States - and potentially the largest source of LC-PUFAs - are byproducts from grain ethanol production. In the U.S., byproduct protein from grain ethanol production is currently sold as cattle feed due to its high fiber content, but it is not suitable as aquaculture feed. One low-value fraction, however - soluble organics from distillation bottoms - called ""thin stillage solubles"" could be ideal for producing yeast that make Ï3-LCPUFAs. The proposal presented here would create a bioengineered lipogenic yeast to convert the soluble organics present in thin stillage into high titers of Ï3-LCPUFAs. At the same time it would provide an amino acid profile appropriate for salmon aquaculture.Xylome has developed a native lipogenic yeast that will produce large amounts of fatty acids from thin stillage solubles. Moreover, we have created a genetic system for this organism that has enabled us to more than double its productivity and lipid accumulation. Using this system we expect to overexpress some of its native genes in order to increase the production of Ï3 fatty acids, and introduce other genes that will convert these into the Ï3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids essential for brain development and maintenance. In Phase I of this project, we will demonstrate the feasibility of producing yeast rich in Ï3-LCPUFAs from low-value stillage byproducts, and in Phase II we will engineer and scale-up production of yeast for aquaculture feed.Ultimately this work will enable the conversion of low-value byproducts from industrial ethanol production into a high value nutritional supplement for aquaculture production both domestically and abroad. As a result of successful development, consumers will realize a lower cost for domestically farmed fish. Feed producers will realize a major cost savings. Pro"

The proposed technology once successfully developed will enable existing biofuel producers to reduce their costs while increasing the value and diversity of their byproducts. It will convert their industrial waste products into tailored fatty acids suitable for biodiesel. The technology will be compatible with and complementary to cellulosic ethanol producers, and it could potentially double the amount of biodiesel produced in the U.S. today. The 227 domestic ethanol plants range in size from less than 50 to more than 150 million gallons, and they have a total annual capacity of 15 billion gallons. Every gallon of ethanol also yields 1.9 pounds of soluble organics that must be evaporated or disposed. Xylome?s technology has the potential to convert half of this stream into biodiesel and to expand biodiesel production further with cellulosic feedstocks. By converting a larger fraction of the soluble cellulosic and hemicellulosic sugars along with fermentation byproducts, Xylome will increase the efficiency of existing ethanol plants and increase biofuel production. The objectives of this Phase II research are to increase the rates of production, modification and release of fatty acids from non-conventional lipogenic yeast. Fatty acids have much higher energy density than ethanol, but similar specific energy yields. Fermentation of organics to lipids can potentially occur with efficiencies equivalent to ethanol production. Lipids normally accumulate under nitrogen limiting conditions after replication has stopped. They are not excreted from the cells so recovery does not require distillation. In Phase I, Xylome scientists identified and over expressed genes that increase lipid accumulation by 1.2- to 2-fold under high nitrogen conditions. In Phase II, they will use mating, selection, screening and evolutionary adaptation to combine the best of these modifications. Xylome scientists have also targeted additional genes to modify and release fatty acids from the cell. Xylome plans to optimize lipid production both from a cellular level with metabolic engineering and from an engineering perspective through bioprocess design and cultivation conditions. Xylome will also engineer cells to use rapidly the complex mixture of soluble oligosaccharides, hemicellulosic sugars and fermentation byproducts. By applying advanced molecular techniques and synthetic biology, Xylome will open up new opportunities for sustainable biofuel production."

Xylome Corporation is using biotechnology to engineer a yeast platform that will produce fatty oils. This will facilitate conversion of existing biofuel and biomass byproduct streams into useful commercial fatty acids while reducing processing costs. The production of fatty acids will facilitate production of the initial downstream target which is biodiesel, but longer term, the technology could enhance production of higher value second-generation biofuels. Xylome?s proposed technology could produce approximately 1.2 million gallons of biodiesel/yr. worth about $4 million from the byproducts of a single 70 million gallon ethanol plant. Beyond sugars from byproduct streams of existing ethanol plants, Xylome?s technology platform could facilitate fatty acid production from cellulosic and hemicellulosic sugars serving as a feedstock for cellulosic biofuel production. The first objective of this Phase I research project is to enable lipid production during growth. The second will be to relieve cellular capacity constraints. The project will alter regulation of genes that limit production and introduce pathways that expand capacity. Yeasts, and fungi synthesize lipid when given excess carbon and limiting nitrogen, but low levels of lipid synthesis occurs during cell growth. Normally lipid only accumulates in cellular vacuoles after cell division has stopped. This requires extended cultivation times, and the amount of lipid that can be formed is constrained by the cell volume. The proposed approach will overexpress the enzymes for lipid synthesis so that the engineered cells will produce oil during growth while maintaining high levels of metabolic activity. New pathways will be introduced along with processes that will enable continuous lipid recovery. These modifications should enable a) lipid production in continuous high-density culture, thereby overcoming inherent low rates of lipid synthesis, and b) continuous separation of lipid, thereby alleviating the need for cell harvest, rupture and extraction."

Xylyx is developing a pulmonary fibrosis disease modeling and anti-fibrotic compound testing platform aimed at
improving the physiological relevance and predictive value of in-vitro models for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
(IPF) to power the investigation of IPF disease biology and accelerate development of drugs to treat IPF.
Devastating, intractable, and life-threatening, IPF is an interstitial lung disease characterized by obliteration of
pulmonary alveoli and progressive loss of respiratory function. Over 55,000 new cases of IPF are diagnosed
each year. Median survival is 3â4 years, and annual mortality in the US exceeds 40,000. The etiology and
pathogenesis of IPF remain unknown. Predictive animal and in-vitro models of IPF for basic science research
and drug development are severely lacking, leaving a significant unmet need and market opportunity for a
physiologically-relevant in-vitro platform that enables high-fidelity cell-based phenotypic studies of IPF. This
SBIR Fast Track will support development and validation studies for commercialization of an IPF disease
modeling and compound testing platform that recapitulates in vitro key features of the human IPF disease
environment and has been shown to support fibrotic phenotype of human lung fibroblasts to improve cell-based
assays in early-stage anti-fibrotic drug discovery. The technological innovation is the productâs human IPF fibrotic
lung specificity stemming from proprietary methods for isolating acellular human IPF lung extracellular matrix
(ECM) with the composition and biomechanics of human IPF lung tissue. Our âphysiomimetic approachâ yields
standardized human fibrotic lung cell culture substrates for predictive in-vitro models of IPF that enable more
physiologic and thus more predictive studies, providing a major competitive advantage over existing products
like collagen-coated polystyrene plates. The goal is validation and commercialization of standard human IPF
lung ECM disease modeling and compound testing platform for predictive in-vitro models of IPF to greatly reduce
dependence on animal models and enable more relevant results for IPF drug developers. Specific aims are to:
(i) determine transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of lung fibroblasts in human IPF and normal lung ECM
hydrogels, (ii) evaluate quality and consistency of human IPF and normal lung ECM hydrogels, (iii) perform
compound testing studies with IPF standard-of-care drugs. After successful completion of the Fast Track project,
Xylyx will commercialize the IPF compound testing platform to scientists in pharmaceutical companies in need
of predictive IPF disease models for drug discovery and screening, thus reducing the significant costs associated
with late-stage attrition due to poor efficacy, and facilitating the development of improved treatment options for
the more than 3 million sufferers of IPF worldwide. The product of this SBIR Fast Track will immediately enter
the rapidly growing cell culture market segment in biopharma and drug development, valued at USD $6.4B in
2014 and estimated to reach USD $29.2B by 2024, and will support drug development aimed at the USD $3.0B
IPF treatment market.NARRATIVE
In this SBIR Fast Track project, Xylyx proposes to develop and commercialize a pulmonary fibrosis disease
modeling and anti-fibrotic drug testing platform that helps scientists better understand and develop drugs for
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a devastating and fatal chronic lung disease. Predictive models for pulmonary
fibrosis drug development and testing are lacking, leaving a significant need for physiologically-relevant
experimental models and testing platforms. The project output will enable more biologically-relevant research,
deeper scientific understanding, and novel therapeutic development for IPF, which will empower high-impact
discoveries that can improve treatment options and outcomes for patients with pulmonary fibrosis."

Xylyx Bio is developing an innovative biomimetic lung-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) foam sealant
material that effectively seals and supports tissue healing for pulmonary air leaks after lung surgery and
thoracic trauma. Pulmonary air leak is one of the most common complications after lung surgery, leading to
extended chest tube drainage time, patient pain and immobilization, increased risk of infection and
bronchopleural fistulae, and subsequent longer hospital stay, with higher associated healthcare costs. In the
US alone, over 400,000 patients are at risk for developing pulmonary air leaks every year. Despite the high
risk, incidence, and cost of post-surgical pulmonary air leaks, an effective lung sealant is not available.
Several synthetic and naturally-derived materials have been tested, but none achieve the required tensile
strength, elasticity, adhesive strength and burst pressure resistance for reliably sealing and healing air leaks,
thus leaving a significant unmet need. This Phase I SBIR will develop, demonstrate performance,
and assess biocompatibility/systemic response of a biomimetic foam sealant comprised of lung ECM that
both seals and heals pulmonary air leaks, filling a known gap in therapeutic options for treating and managing
air leaks. The technological innovation is the demonstrably novel, unique âlung-mimeticâ foam sealant
features â porous (alveolar-like) structure, mechanics, and bioactivity â that enable rapid sealing and active
lung tissue healing, and the proprietary methods for isolating/processing lung ECM and formulating the
sealant. The long-term goal is to develop a lung-mimetic sealant that rapidly seals and heals pulmonary air
leaks, leading to reduction of recovery time, postoperative complications, and healthcare costs. The Phase I
hypothesis is that a lung-mimetic sealant comprised of lung tissue-derived ECM components with elastic
modulus and porosity similar to those of lung tissue can effectively seal and repair air leaks, with excellent
biocompatibility, appropriate biodegradation rate, and immunologic response that supports wound healing.
Specific aims are to establish lung sealant formulation that results in the desired lung-mimetic features,
demonstrate sealant performance in an ex-vivo swine lung model, and assess biocompatibility and systemic
response to the foam sealant in a rat model. After Phase I aims are accomplished, demonstrating safety and
efficacy in a large animal long-term survival model will be essential for development towards
commercialization. Thus, in Phase II, we will assess sealant performance and wound healing in a
chronic swine model to inform a preliminary draft of 510(k) premarket notification. Xylyx Bio will then work
towards making a lung-mimetic lung sealant commercially available to surgeons in need of a reliable,
effective lung sealant to reduce costs to the health care system and improve outcomes for patients
recovering from lung surgery and thoracic trauma.NARRATIVE
In this Phase I SBIR, Xylyx Bio proposes to develop a biomimetic lung-derived extracellular matrix sealant
material that effectively seals and supports tissue healing of pulmonary air leaks. Despite the high risk,
incidence, and cost of post-surgical air leaks, an effective lung sealant is not available, leaving a significant gap
in therapeutic options to treat pulmonary air leaks. The availability of a lung sealant capable of rapidly and
bioactively healing air leaks, thereby reducing recovery time, postoperative complications, and healthcare
costs will provide surgeons with an option for reliably and effectively sealing air leaks, thus improving
outcomes for patients recovering from lung surgery and thoracic trauma."

The high power charge/discharge rate of current super-capacitors is offset by a low storage capacity compared to batteries. The capacitance of activated carbon super-capacitor electrodes is partially limited by the large diameter and wide size distribution of pores resulting from conventional synthesis from organic precursors. This proposal will develop a novel method to produce nano-porous carbon with a narrow distribution of pores less than 2 nm in diameter. Metal atoms are chemically etched from a metal carbide lattice, leaving only carbon, the pore size of which can be tuned with Angstrom precision by varying the carbide precursor or etching conditions. While the use of a metal carbide lattice as a template for porous carbon allows precise control over the pore size, the pore volume is limited by the number of carbon atoms per unit of volume in the carbide lattice. Increasing the volume of pores and specific surface area without substantial broadening of the pore size distribution would lead to a significant increase in capacitance. Because of their long life and rapid power delivery, super-capacitors are replacing or supplementing batteries and fuel cells in many applications. Advanced super-capacitors will be used for energy harvesting from fast processes and for storage of electrical energy, facilitating the production and use of electrical energy from alternative sources.

Batteries are widely used, but have limited power capability and cycle life. Supercapacitors, also called ultracapacitors or double-layer capacitors, are rechargeable electrical energy storage devices Supercapacitors offer higher power, and greater cyclability than batteries. However, their lower energy density limits operation time of electrical equipment running on supercapacitors alone. Neither battery nor supercapacitor technology alone offers both high power and high energy. Therefore, a hybrid (batteryâsupercapacitor) system is needed for an optimum combination of power and energy density. Although the supercapacitor is mainly a high-power device in a hybrid configuration, the supercapacitorâs energy density is important. Increased energy density allows high power output for longer times. Conventional activated carbon for supercapacitors has limited pore size control, limiting device energy density. This project will develop supercapacitor-battery hybrids utilizing supercapacitors incorporating nanoporous carbide-derived carbon electrodes providing higher volumetric and gravimetric capacitance than existing materials. The manufacturing process explored in this SBIR relies on synthesis of nanoporous carbon with controlled pore size, leading to hybrid power storage devices with energy density (> 500 Wh/L) and supplying power > 500 kW for at least 5 minutes."

We have successfully met the Phase I goal by demonstrating the feasibility, and are now ready for fabricating and testing the Phase II prototype generators that will play vital roles in convincing private investors for equity investment, and in fabricating mass-produced Phase III commercial product generators. Based on the Phase I success, two classes of prototype/premarket products will be built: 1) Explosive Driven EUV-x-ray Generators for generating pulsed high energy (photon pulse energy > 1 kJ) EUV-soft-x-ray beams in partnership with Los Alamos National Lab, and 2) Accelerator Driven EUV-x-ray Generators for generating super-intense (photon flux power > 100 W) CW EUV-soft-x-ray beams. Based on the contact with private investors, with our prototypes in hand during Phase II, we will be able to secure Series A investment via private placement for expediting commercialization and licensing deal. In addition, during Phase II we will design marketable generators for continuing into Phase III, which will enable us to secure Series B investment."

Specific military applications of such intense EUV-x-ray beams include countering a wide range of WMDs. The chief barrier to realizing these applications is that the generation of EUV-x-ray beams with traditional technologies is highly energy inefficient, costly, bulky and technologically challenging. We propose to demonstrate the feasibility of developing highly energy-efficient super-intense compact EUV-x-ray generators that can overcome the barrier, thus can be mass produced and commercialized. The technological basis of the proposed generators is on the newly discovered quantum state, Metastable Innershell Molecular State (MIMS) in Warm Dense Matter (WDM). WDM is a class of""stellar""matters with low electron temperatures, which can permit abundant quantum mechanical states, such as MIMS that has excitation energy orders of magnitude larger than that of common chemical quantum states. In addition to technological feasibility demonstration, during Phase I, we plan to perform market studies, to establish their potential customers, and to start contacting private investors for acquiring matching fund for expanding Phase II into Phase III."

gans, and (2) automate processes thereby reducing user skill requirements. The proposed computer software will offer a faster and more reliable capability for predicting the toxicity of potential pharmaceutical products without animal testing. This tool is
 expected to be of substantial value to companies developing new pharmaceutical products as it will enable them to screen out drug formulations with unintended negative toxicological consequences prior to spending years and hundreds of millions of dollars
on their development. The company's proprietary software uses an advanced quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) approach enhanced through the use of computational neural networks (CNNs), wavelets, modern statistical methods, and molecular me
chanics. Jackknife and bootstrap resampling methods are used to avoid bias. The tool can be trained on data obtained via various methods, including microarray, mass spectroscopy, and emerging techniques. The proposed research will allow the company to brin
g to market within 3 years a toxicology prediction tool suitable for use by researchers with limited computational chemistry, toxicology, and computer skills. Preliminary prototype testing has demonstrated 94%-98% accurate hepatotoxicology endpoint predict
ions. Accuracy increases with increased database size, i.e., client companies with proprietary databases will achieve higher accuracy. The company believes that comparable results can be obtained for multiple human organs and that its evaluation process, w
hich currently requires substantial computational chemistry and toxicology expertise by the user, can be automated to enable accurate predictions without those skills. One challenge is eliminating the requirement for user expertise without degrading predic
tive accuracy. Phase I research will demonstrate the feasibility of integrating a number of predictive algorithms previously developed by the company with molecular mechanics force field coding to enable predictions to be made by entering basic chemical co
mpound formula information. It will demonstrate accurate multiple human organ toxicity predictions (hepatotoxicology and renal toxicology). During the Phase II project, the company will complete predictive and graphical user interface software and user gui
des, and commence beta testing by researchers in target customer companies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project develops a bioinformatics tool that will enable researchers to better understand the potential toxicities of compounds before advancing them t

Current approaches are limited because they are based on heuristics and keyword indexing and rely on manual annotation. This project addresses the problem by leveraging the expressive power of ontologies, augmented with inter-ontological links to derive similarities between gene products. These similarities are then used to empower search and cross-scale discovery. The essence of the innovation consists in deriving a semantic similarity between ontology terms, taking into account the semantic, syntactic, and structural information available in protein databases. Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of automatic cross-referencing of gene ontologies and develop a retrieval algorithm that leverages weighted cross-referenced gene ontologies for the discovery of proteins among select groupings of microbial genomes. A prototype tool will be developed and compared with existing methods for querying microbial databases, in order to determine the effectiveness of the proposed method to mine biological data. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: A tool that would better enable knowledge transfer by peering across ontological domains should have application to the exploitation of microbes to accelerate environmental cleanup and to improved disease prevention and control. Beyond biological research, users may range from legal practitioners, the military, educational institutions, economists, law enforcement and homeland security agencies, e-commerce, and business-to-business transactions over the Internet."

This project bridges the understanding between physical and chemical principles and genomic/proteomic response by integrating three independent parallel toxicity prediction tools. Each uses computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets to rapidly and accurately make pharmaceutical/chemical toxicity predictions.

Further, toxicogenomic databases lack the ontology structures provided by the Gene Ontology making data searches laborious.
This research sets forth innovative approaches designed to allow researchers to search across biomedical gene and toxicology ontology domains in free text using semantic similarity techniques. It will enhance cross-scale scientific discovery and facilitate effectively managing the exponentially growing research/clinical experience knowledge base.

The health hazards of these materials must beevaluated to protect personnel and to minimize life cycle costs for weaponsystems. To evaluate health risks, chemical toxicity information is needed.However such information is costly and requires several years of testing toobtain. As a result, reliable data are available for only a few percent ofthe chemicals in use today. The research under this Phase I SBIR project isdirected at demonstrating the feasibility of using artificial intelligenceapproaches to estimate human health risks from exposure to chemical hazards. To accomplish this feasibility demonstration, a chemical toxicity database will be designed and developed to underpin predictions of genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, anddevelopmental/reproductive toxicity for chemicals of interest to the Air Force. Both a neural network and statistical techniques will be used to predict these three toxicity endpoints, and the performance of the two approaches compared. Technicalfeasibility will be demonstrated by achieving a 90 percent or better accuracy in predicting toxicity for chemicals of interest to the Air Force. This level of performance representsa significant improvement over currently available systems.If proven feasible during Phase I, YAHSGS' approach to predicting chemical toxicity will provide a rapid and inexpensive means to determine the health risks of new chemicals; the risks of existingchemicals for which inadequate toxicity data exist for conducting health hazard assessments (~80% of chemicals in commercial use); and risks for chemicals encountered in military and industrial situations. The Chemical and Material Toxicity EvaluationModule (CAMTEM) will be sold either as an application for installation on a user's system or as a tool to be used via Online Analytical Processing (OLAP). The OLAP approach will greatly expand the user group and market potential by reducing the user'shardware, software, and, potentially, training requirements. Two specialized modules will be developed to expand the CAMTEM's usage and marketability to government and industrial users. The first will predict environmental effects of subject chemicalsincluding the risks associated with chemical daughter products formed or released to the environment. The second will provide reverse engineering capabilities that will identify ways for chemical designers to eliminate or reduce health risks fromchemicals or products being developed. The overall benefit from the CAMTEM approach will be the availability of significantly better health risk information for the 80% or more of the chemicals now in commercial use for which there are currentlyinadequate toxicity risk related information and for new chemicals being developed. That information will enhance governments' and industries' ability to recognize specific chemical toxicity related risks and take responsible steps to avoid exposingpeople and the environment to harmful chemicals."

The technology combines a proprietary trocar catheter with a MEMS-based microfluidic system for controlled, sustained delivery of vestibulo-active or cochleo-active drugs into the middle ear for absorption to the inner ear, for common hearing and vestibular disorders for applications in the otolaryngology, office-based setting. This Phase I project will utilize preliminary research, including prior catheter studies with human temporal bones, as well as research around dosing and micropumping to design and develop a breadboard prototype for controlled, transtympanic delivery that includes: (a) insertion technology and circulating system for improved drug perfusion, and (b) a microfluidics technology to deliver drugs with the optimal protocol. The feasibility with physician testers using both plastic ears and temporal bone cores will be evaluated. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is anticipated to be in more effective treatment of common inner ear diseases such as Meniere?s disease, chronic labyrinthitis, sudden sensorineural hearing loss and intractable tinnitus that impact millions of people worldwide. Meniere?s disease affects approximately 12 in 1000 individuals worldwide, and it is estimated that 7.9 million individuals in the U.S. suffer from tinnitus. Although the advantages of transtympanic delivery are generally understood, control remains a major challenge to realizing optimal and consistent outcomes. Wide inter-subject, and even intra-subject, variability in outcomes has presented a major problem with current practice, introducing the potential of serious side effects, such as oto-toxicity, that can lead to permanent hearing loss and vestibular hypofunction, or dysfunction. Recent studies indicate these shortcomings can be largely overcome with precise, controlled, sustained, low concentration delivery to the round window membrane. While research is underway to develop products for surgically-implanted controlled or passive time-release delivery, there is significant value for advancing a non-surgical, less invasive and more actively-controlled delivery. It is expected that this technology will overcome both efficacy and practical shortcomings of the technologies on the market and in development."

In addition to ever-increasing bandwidth demands from wireless handheld communications devices, explosive growth in machine-to-machine, inter-device wireless communications is exhausting spectrum resources, which can be resolved only by near zero-sum allocation decisions made through a mixture of bidding and politics. Society requires ""new spectrum"" but regulations are difficult to enforce. The objective is to demonstrate a usable data link within an atmospheric absorption line feature creating a self-limiting link distance, allowing spectrum reuse. The opportunity is to pack more communications channels within the same spectrum resource by transmitting within the molecular absorption bands (principally of O2 and H2O). Particularly for short-range data transmission within spectral regions where the atmosphere is strongly absorbing, range limitations are automatically enforced by the laws of physics. This technique will enable large numbers of wireless communications transmitters to reuse spectrum outside the range exceeding the opacity of the atmosphere, hence eliminating potential interference. Anticipated results are dramatic improvements in channel carrying capacity. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to increase the maximum number of data links the atmosphere can accommodate at any given time. Because the spectrum is a scarce natural resource, optimizing its use is a societal goal. The motivation for operators of transmission devices to actually choose to self-limit is that by doing so, they improve their signal-to-noise against a sea of competing users at a lower cost than simply increasing power in an unattenuated channel. The physics of molecular gaseous absorption within the atmosphere at millimeter frequencies will enforce by law of nature what heretofore has required monitoring and regulatory enforcement. In addition to improving the efficiency of mobile phones and wireless internet commercial wireless communications, spectrum reuse technology enhances sensor communications. Sensor 'clouds' will create myriad opportunities to enhance learning and scientific investigation, such as enhancing understanding of behavior within active hurricanes. Enhanced data link security is provided, as eavesdropping is rendered impossible beyond the link range afforded by atmospheric opacity at that frequency. Millimeter wave electronics have become sufficiently mature and inexpensive to address a wide variety of industrial, scientific and consumer device applications. Nearly all electronic wireless mobile devices and sensors could benefit."

A primary goal is to provide accuracy while simultaneously withstanding the severe launch shock environment of ALE-47 Electronics Countermeasure Dispensers (ECD); past SBIR-funded R & D efforts using ECD deployment destroyed thermistors due to high initial acceleration. Our design will be capable of long periods of dormancy, yet will obtain a rapid GPS 3D lock immediately after launch, and we will use standard UHF ground support receiving equipment. To alleviate issues of thermodynamic cooling of the thermistor by rain, we plan to provide two independent methods to measure air temperature. First, a unique mechanical support will protect the fragile precision air temperature thermistor during the 100+ G launch initiation. Next, we will design an optical limb pointing infrared sensor that uses atmospheric infrared radiance arising from water vapor (humidity) in spectral absorption bands. The latter technique will provide a reliable surrogate for air temperature even when the thermistor is wetted by precipitation and experiences evaporative cooling errors. This effort includes not only hardware/firmware prototype development but also successive flight tests conducted at DoD. BENEFIT: The initial benefit is to provide real time PTU+winds data to DoD flight performance evaluation of new and existing air platforms. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models run by AF and Navy weather agencies (MM5 and COAMPS) will each benefit from leveraging sounding data collected by""flights of convenience""; the thousands of ALE-47-equipped aircraft ferrying personnel and materiel to remote continents will profile the upper air in remote regions, providing data to initialize NWP models in data sparse regions such as the eastern Pacific. Next, the hurricane communities, particularly the USAF""s 53rd will benefit from additional soundings via the C-130Js they fly into active hurricanes, by removing the need for a manual dropsonde operator. DoD squadrons tasked with precision air drops as well as new P8 high altitude ASW aircraft requires dropsondes to obtain wind that enable precision emplacement of assets such as expensive sonobuoy assets. Finally, scientific research on our earth""s changing climate will benefit from increased frequency, accurate 4D atmospheric measurements."

It will provide a real time ascertainment of EPA clean air act requirements at DoD installations within the CONUS. It will be usable by minimally trained personnel and can be used from any angle except directly into the sun. Unlike traditional human observations, because it contains a self-contained eye safe laser source, the system can be used day or night and it can be automated. Today, significant funds are spent training human ""smoke observers"" to perform EPA Method 9 observations at DoD installations. This process is fraught with simple human error as well as psychological disincentives ranging from tedium to guilt from penalizing the contracting organization and potentially forcing an inconvenient shutdown of a base''s steam heating plant to non-compliance. The system consists of a small eye safe lidar and digital camera, and a portable lidar and image processing computer. It is man-portable and can run from battery power. Measurements can either be made continuously, at specific times throughout a work day, or via a scanner at pre-determined geographical coordinates/angles providing observations of multiple nearby plumes.  BENEFIT: Automated opacity systems will effectively take the human out of the loop, allowing personnel to be deployed in more value added tasks. Removal of subjectivity from the manual observations will eliminate personal bias. The devices will also enable the creation of a permanent digital record of an industrial site''s point source air pollution. Increasing the frequency of such environmental opacity measurements will go a long way to both reducing operational training cost for smoke observers, as well as improve the trust between EPA and every agency it is charged with regulating."

Passive imaging techniques for opacity measurements unfortunately are constrained by two limits: First, the observer must be located between the sun and the target plume of interest and second, the scene must be bright enough to ensure images have sufficient contrast ratios. That is, the sun must be located behind the observerâs camera and it must be daytime. Although the first requirement can be met through careful planning, most military missions necessarily occur under the cover of nightfall, where such imaging methods are unusable. We describe a portable passive CCD imager integrated with an eye-safe lidar rangefinder to acquire plume backscatter data to support both daytime contrast CCD imaging opacity measurement and nighttime operation, via the ""lidar equation."" If in the field it becomes impractical to observe with the sun behind the observer, the lidar beam can also supplant measurements during daytime hours from locations where forward scattered light pollution from the sunâs direct beam would otherwise render radiance CCD imaging impossible. The R&D of this sensor suite involves both hardware and software algorithms."

Ship-based upper air stations provide synoptic observations but also act as homing beacons for the fleet. Few air-deployed dropsondes are deployedâusually only in hurricanes by specially-equipped WP3 and C-130 aircraft. Future advances in the accuracy and capability of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, particularly in littoral regions near large population centers, hinge heavily upon accurate initial condition data. This data can ideally be provided by in-situ dropsonde observations. What is needed is a low cost and reliable mechanism to enable more routine at-sea soundings. We propose to develop a highly rugged dropsonde technology that is mechanically-compatible with the thousands of ALE-47 electronic countermeasure dispensers widely deployed across multiple DoD manned and unmanned aerial vehicles. The miniature dropsondes will be preloaded into one or more ALE chambers and automatically activate upon release. While in flight, the dropsonde will telemeter PTU, GPS winds, and sea surface temperature to low earth-orbiting data satellites. Near real time data will feed sounding data to the Fleet Numerical Prediction center's NPW models. We call this concept the âAutomated Dropsonde Atmospheric Measurement Systemâ (ADAMS)."

Ideally, what is needed is a sensor that assesses real time vertical profiles of humidity, clouds and index/temperature and calculates the current radar ducting and optical visibility conditions for the shipâs local vicinity, feeding in real time to decision makers. While working, it must maintain a low probability-of-detection profile. Navy has traditionally launched radiosondes from ships to derive upper air vertical soundings of winds, temperature and dew point. However, radiosondes pose several logistical and cost challenges as they are essentially narrow band RF homing beacons, making them unsuitable in certain situations. As they are launched manually, they require trained manpower and adequate topside space, which is at a premium on most ship platforms. An automatic system for making routine measurements of key atmospheric parameters of interest to EO propagation models would be highly desirable . An all-optical lidar sensor capable of reliably interrogating these basic atmospheric conditions up to and through the boundary layer is described and has the potential to decrease the reliance on expensive and often unreliable radiosonde upper air soundings."

This nighttime observational network will be able to capture space weather events that disrupt electromagnetic communications systems, including the effectiveness of GPS-guided ordinance. DoD has C4I assets spread across the globe. Reliable and predictable communications is a very high priority. Our approach involves low light multi-spectral imaging of the ionosphere from multiple locations on the ground. In addition to working in realistic field conditions, the imagers will have the ability to discern cloud movement that can occlude vision to the upper reaches of the ionosphere.

In addition to the micro-sodar wind sensor, individual pressure, temperature, humidity, soil moisture and solar measurements are provided. There are no moving parts in the design, which is rugged enough to be dropped from the air.

This project will assess the performance of light emitting diodes (LEDs) for this purpose by testing their stability over time and temperature. The novel concept of spectral shaping will be investigated. The design of the irradiance calibrator will then be tailored to take advantage of these particular characteristics. Phase I will extensively characterize LEDs to test stability and spectral output. Theoretical and data based models of LED output will be built to assess the feasibility of shaping the spectral output to match the solar spectrum and to determine the best configuration for a solid-state calibrator.

Emphasis will be on expander mechanical configurations that have the potential to minimizethe wear and friction conditions imposed on the tribological elements of the design, such as may be available with the scroll type expander design. Steam conditions to 1000 pisg will be investigated."

Yankee Scientific's Liquid Injected Cogeneration (LIC) cycle currently provides electric power anddistributed heating capability for the cooking systems in the US Army's SLIC kitchen. The normal operation of this cycle produces the proper steam supply that is needed to implement steam-jet refrigeration, thereby minimizing the additional hardwarerequired. Successful applications of steam-jet refrigeration are typically found in industrial settings where excess or waste steam is available. The SLIC kitchen satisfies this criteria for success.Novel adaptations of steam ejector and evaporator technologies will be investigated to apply steam-jet refrigeration to the relatively small sizes required for refrigerator use. Coolant lines will pump chilled water from the steam-jet chiller to therefrigerator, thus enhancing the flexibility of locating the refrigerator. The potential for steam-driven ice production will also be evaluated as a means of temperature stabilization for the refrigerator and as a source of ice for external use. Providing refrigeration in the field is a longstanding challenge that has typically been addressed through the use of transported ice, vapor compression refrigeration or heat-driven refrigeration. Steam-jet technology takes advantage of the steam supplysystem inherent in the SLIC kitchen hardware and uses it to economically produce significantly more cooling capacity than most heat driven refrigeration systems can deliver. Steam-jet cooling avoids the logistical difficulties of transporting ice, is lesscomplex than Zeoliter or Chemisorption systems and uses much less electric power than vapor compression systems.Yankee Scientific is actively involved with the development of residential combined heat and electric power (CHP) systems utilizing Liquid Injected Cogeneration. This technology is best applied where there is a heating demand, which is normally foundduring the heating season or when potable water heating is required. If steam-jet refrigeration can be implemented for summer cooling applications then waste heat from the power production cycle could be used to drive the cooling system. The payback andmarketability of this class of appliances would be greatly increased with the addition of such a cooling capability."

Guyer,,(508) 359-7999,,,,,,"This proposal is for the design and development of an auxiliary body heating system to be worn by soldiers operating in extremely cold environments. The design is based on circulating a fluid through a garment. Power for the pump is provided by a thermoelectric generator which simultaneously acts as the heat source for the pumped liquid. The thermoelectric generator is heated by a low-output catalytic propane burner. A unique advantage of using thermoelectrics for this application is that the electrical requirements for driving a low-capacity fluid pump are very small. Also, the heat energy normally wasted in a thermoelectric generator is now used to heat the liquid flowing through the garment. Thus, the overall efficiency of the system can be very high and only a small amount of fuel needs to be carried along to provide 4 hours of reliable and quiet body heating under the most severe conditions. The complete system, including fuel supply, power generator, and heat exchanger will be compact and lightweight, will require no batteries, and will be designed to fit in a backpack. Personal cooling and heating garments are already on the market for a range of applications in the military and commercial sectors.

Silver-Zinc batteries provide high energy and power density cells, and since the electrolyte is a water-based alkaline fluid, provide a comparatively safe battery. A disadvantage to this technology is large format cells, which are required to provide high power, do not provide comparable cycle life performance to competing systems. There are two main issues. One is the negative electrode, having redox products being zinc and zinc oxide, experiences non-uniform re-plating of the zinc upon charging. The mass tends toward the bottom of the current collector as the cell accumulates cycles. The other issue is the separator, commonly used cellophane, experiences degradation due to the strongly oxidative positive silver oxide electrode. The primary work will be to advance from the Phase I to the Phase II the further refinements of circumventing the shortcomings of silver/zinc. This includes incorporating binders with the negative electrodes to limit dissolution of the electrode while cycling and developing a non-cellulosic cellophane replacement.

The salts offer the potential for significant cost saving over the current industry standard and showed good performance characteristics including conductivities as high as 4.8 mS/cm, electrochemical stability from 0 V to > 4.5 V, excellent solubility, and compatibility with standard Li-ion cell electrode materials. Phase II will scale up the synthesis of the lithium salts developed in Phase I and continue the investigation of other related salts. The salts will be tested in 7 Ah or greater size Li-ion cells to evaluate performance and to demonstrate their utility in electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The lower cost Li salt technology should make Li-ion batteries more affordable and commercially viable in electric and hybrid electric vehicles. Other applications include computers, cell phones, and satellites."

Trends in the United States and lesser developed economies are going in the wrong direction. The availability of a single multipurpose prevention product (MPT) that prevents both unplanned pregnancy and one or more of the most prevalent sexually transmitted diseases is a priority for both NICHD and NIAID. The development of Yaso-GEL, a vaginal gel formulation, will provide one of the first MPT products offering both pregnancy and STI protection, one that is easy to obtain and to use, that does not require medical services. In addition, Yaso-GEL is applied vaginally pre-coitally, has pre-fertilization contraceptive action, is non-hormonal and non-systemic. These characteristics avoid many safety concerns of current contraceptive users. The primary purpose of this Phase 2B grant is to complete CMC and toxicology studies required by FDA to submit an IND for Yaso-GEL. Secondarily, based on in vitro data, we wish to study the prophylactic potential of Yaso-GEL against two common sexually transmitted infections in cutting edge murine models. We are developing a new drug, polyphenylene carboxymethylene (PPCM) in a vaginal contraceptive gel (Yaso-GEL) as a multipurpose prevention technology (MPT) under R44HD092206. In preclinical testing, PPCM inhibits a broad spectrum of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng), Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), in addition to having contraceptive activity. Under this grant, we will complete the work needed to open our IND. This includes: a) scale up Yaso- GEL under cGMP, fill applicators for clinical trials and establish a 3-year stability study; b) complete a toxicology study in rats as a second species; c) complete the last genotoxicity study; d) validate the bioassay in human cervicovaginal secretions and plasma; e) design Phase I and Phase 2 clinical trials for safety and contraceptive efficacy, utilizing a new ex vivo assay of contraceptive activity to establish optimal dose response; f) submit the IND. Secondarily, Yaso-GEL will be evaluated in murine models for prevention of infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng) and Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct). If effective, future clinical trials may be conducted to evaluate prevention of these important STI pathogens in humans.In this Phase 2B SBIR grant, Yaso will complete IND-enabling studies and manufacturing so that we may
submit our IND for Yaso-GEL as a new, non-hormonal vaginal contraceptive which shows promise to serve as
a multipurpose prevention technology (MPT). The active drug in Yaso-GEL is a new pharmaceutical, with
activity against Herpes simplex (HSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng) and Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct). If successful in submitting our IND at the end of this grant, we will have a new vaginal contraceptive ready for Phase 1 clinical trials which could lead to Phase 2 clinical trials for prevention of one or more sexually transmitted diseases as well as ongoing contraceptive studies. Yaso-GEL may be one of the first MPT products commercialized for the purpose of stemming the ongoing epidemics of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections."

We will conduct all tasks required to generate the Pharmacology/Toxicology and Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) information required for IND submission, and outline the early clinical study designs with FDA. Development will be Go/No Go Decision and milestone driven to efficiently (resource, cost and time) evaluate the drug product in biologically relevant models for activity and safety, meet FDA and ICH requirements and manufacture drug and product suitable for early clinical trial material. We will address compliance issues experienced in recent HIV microbicidetrials by developing three prototypes and evaluating their consumer acceptability, safety and efficacy; then selecting the superior product form for final preclinical studies. Within ten months of grant approval, prototype formulations of three different vaginal formulations (aqueous gel, ovule and thin film) will be quickly prepared using modified recipes from industry, analytically tested and evaluated in four non GLP models: 10-day Rabbit Vaginal Irritation (RVI), cutting edge in vitro models for safety,HSV-prevention in the mouse model and contraception in the rabbit (funded by NICHD) providing us with data to select one product form for further development. Utilizing the 1kg of PPCM manufactured by Regis Chemical in the Phase I SBIR, one dosage form will be selected, incorporating consumer feedback using vehicle control products, to be taken forward by a commercial contract manufacturer through thorough development of the product formula, process and package. The CMO will produce product for use in INDenabling GLP toxicology and product stability studies. Reasonably priced quotes were obtained from the most reputable CMOs in the field. From the initiation of Phase II SBIR grant approval, a pre-IND meeting briefing document will be compiled and issued. The document will be accompanied with IND development questions addressed to FDA for response. These will include questions to finalize the Pharmacology/Toxicology study protocols and Phase I-II clinical study designs. In parallel to that, preparations willbe made for manufacturing and quality control testing of a 1kg GMP batch of drug substance (PPCM) for clinical use. The first item will be to implement the Quality Agreement (commitments by both parties to satisfy quality and regulatory requirements); manufacturing controls; and qualified/validated analytical test methods required to release and monitor the stability of the GMP lot of drug substance suitable for early clinical trials.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal ofthis Phase II SBIR is to further develop Polyphenylenecarboxymethylene (PPCM) as a dual indication vaginal contraceptive microbicide. PPCM, a novel drug polymer, has received extensive preclinical evaluation by several major laboratories and is considereda very promising candidate for both contraception and sexually transmitted infections (STI) protection. Statistics from CDC inform us that there are 19 million new STI in the USA each year and 16.2% of adults have genital herpes (HSV). Moreover, 49% of all pregnancies are unplanned. As a microbicide, PPCM has significant advantages in safety and effectiveness compared to polyanion microbicides and in combination with a reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) promises to offer significant STI protection. As acontraceptive, PPCM has a dual mechanism for sperm inactivation. During this grant we will also address the problem of consumer acceptance of vaginal products by seeking early consumer input on product aesthetics. This grant will provide funding necessaryto select an aesthetically acceptable, safe and effective product form and complete all preclinical studies required by the FDA for submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application subsequent to human clinical testing."

This is inextricably linked to another public health problem, anepidemic of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). For women, a safe and effective vaginal contraceptive/microbicide would allow women to protect themselves, and help suppress these epidemics. Vaginal microbicide development has suffered numerous setbacks. No microbicide has been shown to be effective in recent clinical trials, and some may even increase the risk of acquiring HIV. Contraceptive development has also been limited - and the only non prescription widely available vaginal contraceptive - Nonoxynol -9 has serious safety concerns. Clearly, microbicide development needs to incorporate better preclinical methods for evaluating safety, develop combinations of active microbicidal ingredients to improve efficacy, and place more focus on their contraceptive effectiveness. NIH NICHD, NIAID) supports contraceptive research (NICHD), and development of methods to prevent STIs. Previous NIH funded accomplishments: PPCM is a second generation vaginal contraceptive/microbicide with the potential for HIV, HSV, HPV, and gonorrhea protection. PPCM inhibits HSV-2 infection of epithelial cells in culture and protects mice from genital herpes infection. PPCM, unlike other polyanions, is active in semen. PPCM is also contraceptive in vitro and in the rabbit. PPCM inhibits infections by laboratory and clinical R5 and X4 clade B and clade C HIV strains in cell culture and blocks transfer of HIV to target T-cells via migratory cells. When combined with tenofovir, PPCM shows synergistic anti-HIV activity in vitro. PPCM has been formulated into an aesthetically pleasing gel using GRAS ingredients at two concentrations. The gel maintains preclinical microbicidal and contraceptive activity, is lubricious and appears safe. SBIR Phase Igrant goal and proposed project plan: The goals of our Phase I SBIR are to: a) finalize analytical methods for PPCM API and formulated gel in order to complete CGMP scale up and production; b) ensure PPCM can be scaled up from 20 gm quantities to production scale quantities of 1 kg; c) determine if PPCM is systemically absorbed via vaginal application in a rabbit model and; d) complete development of our preclinical, Phase 0 and Phase I clinical trial safety protocols. Accomplishing these goals will allowus to be prepared to conduct all work required to submit an IND application. Our long term goals are to: 1) launch PPCM as a contraceptive vaginal gel; 2) to evaluate PPCM for prevention of non-HIV STIs (specifically HSV and gonorrhea) and; 3) develop a contraceptive combination microbicidal product including an RTI with PPCM, to enhance HIV prevention and 3) to explore alternative delivery forms such as a vaginal tablet or vaginal ring.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Safe and effective contraception for women and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases are closely linked. The goal of this Phase I SBIR is to further develop PPCM as a vaginal contraceptive microbicide. PPCM, a novel drug polymer, has received extensive preclinical evaluation in several major laboratories and is considered a very promising candidate for both contraception and sexually transmitted disease (STI) protection (1-5). As a microbicide, it has significant advantages in safety and effectiveness compared to other microbicides indevelopment, and in combination with a reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) promises to offer significant STI protection. As a contraceptive, PPCM has a dual mechanism for sperm inactivation. Unlike currently available spermicides, PPCM is not a surfactant and is not cytotoxic. This grant will provide funding necessary to complete a portion of the studies required by the FDA needed for submission of an IND application, and subsequent human clinical testing."

HIV, Chlamdia, gonorrhea, HSV, and HPV continue to spread, particularly via heterosexual transmission. The tragic reality is that most women are powerless to protect themselves and their unborn children from STI's (1). Development of a safe and effective substance which women can use in the vagina to stem the transmission of all STI's is a critical national and global health priority. Such a chemical barrier--called a microbicide--which can be made available to women to use prior to intercourse can make STI prevention a reality for many (2, 3). We propose to continue a promising and novel microbicide called SAMMA (Sulfuric Acid Modified Mandelic Acid). Thousands of substances have been screened as potential microbicides, and a small number of compounds are undergoing further development in the public and private sector. These first generation microbicides may not be ideal, and have some properties which may limit their safety and or effectiveness. These properties include potential damage to vaginal tissue via cell death or inflammation (4, 5), interference with normal host defenses (6), susceptibility to development of viral resistance (7, 8), and inadequate antimicrobial activity in vivo (9). SAMMA is a very promising second generation microbicide which promises to avoid these potentially significant problems. SAMMA is a simple molecule--colorless, odorless, tasteless, water soluble, stable, and inexpensive. SAMMA has broad antimicrobial activity, is not cytotoxic or inflammatory, has an excellent safety profile, and mechanism of action not susceptible to development of viral resistance. We have preliminary in vitro and animal studies showing that SAMMA) can inhibit fusion and entry of HIV, HSV, gonorrhea, and Chlamydia into vaginal cells. SAMMA also neutralizes sperm (10, 11). We propose to produce a stable, safe SAMMA formulation suitable for human clinical trials and aesthetically acceptable to women and their partners. 1. FORMULATION. We have already established a reliable process for SAMMA synthesis. We will develop several formulations which satisfy requirements for stability, aesthetics, and manufacturability, and are buffered to vaginal acidity. Current research suggests that acid buffering that maintains vaginal pH may significantly improve antimicrobial activity (12). 2. SAFETY. These final formulations will be evaluated in cell culture to assess potentially deleterious effects on normal vaginal flora. Cytotoxicity, i.e., tendency to elicit inflammatory reactions will be tested both in human cell culture and in the mouse vagina. 3. EFFICACY. The new formulations will also be evaluated for activity against sperm, chlamydia and HSV utilizing in vitro assays and the mouse model."

 bile acid pool cause malabsorption of vitamin E, carotenoids and other
 fat-soluble antioxidants, which contributes to resulting oxidative stress and
 poor nutritional status, both of which are associated with increased risk of
 disease, neurological dysfunction and reduced quality of life. The object of
 this study is to determine the feasibility of using an oral liquid formulation
 of micellar-like vehicles to overcome malabsorption of important nutrients and
 antioxidants and therefore improve oxidation and nutrition status. The
 researchers intend to study a unique generally regarded as safe (GRAS) molecule
 as the delivery vehicle for fat-soluble nutrients and antioxidants. The
 formulation will be optimized for physical and chemical stability, and for
 taste acceptable to children and young adults. Although tested first in cystic
 fibrosis patients, this technology could be useful to other fat malabsorbers.
 The technology is based on d-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000

Â The main goals of this project are feasibility development of a mission ready delivery solution adapted from YECâs commercial Silent ArrowÂ® GD-2000 productâs underlying spring wing technology, deployment mechanisms, and developing the feasibility of an adapted version specifically for V-22 aircraft which can also be used for side door commercial deployment, and comprehensive airworthiness approval of the resulting AFSOC system. The mission impact of this project on the Air Force and the Department of Defense will potentially increase AFSOC mission effectiveness and the way the USAF conducts aerial delivery while keeping crews and the cargo deployment aircraft out of harmâs way."

Chronic pain (cancer and nonmalignant pain) management is an especially challenging task. The primary groups of agents that have been used to treat pain are the opioids (eg. morphine) and the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID's; eg. ibuprofen, celecoxib). Significant limitations related to side effects and efficacy, most notably for chronic neuropathic pain syndromes (eg. diabetic neuropathy, AID's related neuropathy, complex regional pain syndrome, spinal cord injury) exist with these two classes of drugs. New therapeutic agents for pain with an improved efficacy/side effect profile would result in significant societal benefit. Drugs acting at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are a potentially important new class of analgesic drugs. One such drug, nornicotine, an active metabolite of nicotine, is a promising analgesic candidate. This drug has both a better pharmacokinetic profile (longer half-life, accumulation in the CNS, greater bioavailability) and less toxicity compared to nicotine. Nornicotine has both S(-)- and R(+) enantiomeric forms and the enantiomers appear to differ in analgesic potency and side effects. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that one enantiomer will possess greater analgesic efficacy with acceptable side effects. Our preliminary findings support this possibility and precedent exists for this concept with other analgesic drugs (eg. N-methyl-D- aspartate receptor antagonists). The major goal of this Phase I STTR study is to examine antinociceptive, anti- hyperalgesic and anti-allodynic activity of S(-)- and/or R(+)-nornicotine in rodent models of acute (thermal paw withdrawal), tonic inflammatory (intraplantar formalin injection) and neuropathic pain (sciatic nerve constriction). Locomotor activity and motor coordination (rotorod) will also be examined to determine if the antinociceptive activity of the nornicotine enantiomers occurs without significant motor impairment. Finally, we will determine if there is a synergistic (supra-additive) antinociceptive effect produced when S(-)- and/or R(+)- nornicotine is used in combination with an opioid (morphine). Multi-drug approaches to pain management are clinically well established and such a combination utilizes lower doses of each drug and would be expected to diminish side effects associated with each agent. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Characterize the antinociceptive, anti-hyperalgesic and anti-allodynic effects of S(-)- and R(+)-nornicotine in a rat model of nociceptive, neuropathic and tonic inflammatory pain; 2) Characterize the effects of S(-)- and R(+)-nornicotine on locomotor activity and motor coordination; 3) Characterize the synergistic antinociceptive effect of morphine in combination with S(-)- and R(+)-nornicotine in a rat model of nociceptive pain and 4) Perform synthesis of S(-)- and R(+)-nornicotine for use in the preclinical antinociception and side effect studies. Findings from this Phase I STTR study are important to the long term goal (Phase II studies) of developing a clinically useful analgesic drug (nornicotine enantiomer) suitable for management of pain. The treatment of pain is a critical health issue affecting tens of millions of people annually in the US. New therapeutic agents for pain, especially for chronic pain (cancer-related and nonmalignant) would result in significant societal benefit. This research project focuses on the development of a novel analgesic agent, nornicotine, for pain management."

Research on the neurobiology of ADHD implicates abnormalities in brain dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) and possibly in nicotinic receptors. Currently available stimulant medications reverse the core behavioral symptoms and neurocognitive deficits that characterize ADHD, but are not without limitations or risks. Lobeline is a nonstimulant alkaloid shown in preclinical studies to alter DA and NE neurotransmission by interacting with the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) and acts as a nicotinic receptor antagonist. Lobeline inhibits hyperactivity induced by nicotine and amphetamine. Preclinical studies demonstrate that lobeline decreases the reinforcing effects of methamphetamine, suggesting that it will not increase the use of drugs of abuse. Furthermore, lobeline has been found to be safe in clinical trials. In the proposed initial proof- of-concept, human laboratory study, the physiological and behavioral effects of a range of doses of lobeline will be assessed in adults with ADHD. Particular emphasis will be made to task measures of attention, impulsivity and working memory. In addition, subjective effects related to abuse liability and drug tolerability will be assessed. We hypothesize that lobeline will decrease inattention and impulsivity and enhance working memory in adults with ADHD. We expect lobeline to be well tolerated and not to engender changes in self- report measures associated with abuse liability. Methylphenidate will be evaluated as a positive control to provide confirmation that the measures of inattention, impulsivity and working memory are sensitive to therapeutic drug effects. Results from the proposed study will provide proof-of-concept that lobeline has potential as an efficacious non-stimulant medication for ADHD. If improvements on outcome measures of attention and memory are obtained with lobeline, we will advance to a human clinical trial to demonstrate the efficacy of lobeline in an ADHD population. This project supports the development of a safe and effective non-stimulant medication for the treatment of adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The study will evaluate the ability of lobeline to improve the hallmark symptoms of ADHD, including inattention, impulsivity and memory problems. Also, lobeline will be assessed for side-effects and abuse liability. Information obtained from the proposed study will inform subsequent clinical trials aimed at determining if lobeline is a useful and efficacious treatment for adult ADHD."

Its treatment, in particular chronic neuropathic pain, is an especially challenging task. The development of drugs and drug delivery systems for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain is an important endeavor. One group of drugs with potential use for neuropathic pain is the N-methyi-Daspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists. Drugs from this class have also been shown to enhance the analgesic effect of morphine and to inhibit development of tolerance to this opioid. Ketamine, a clinically available nonselective NMDA receptor antagonist, has been used parenterally for pain. Despite its analgesic potency, side effects (psychotomimetic, motor, sedation) have limited its use. These effects are prominent following parenteral administration being associated with peak plasma levels. Transdermal application, a delivery approach minimizing peak plasma levels, would be expected to provide a better profile of analgesia to side effects. The ideal candidate for a successful transdermal delivery system is a potent drug with a low clearance rate. The rapid clearance rate of ketamine makes it an undesirable candidate for transdermal delivery. However, ketamine is metabolized to norketamine. Norketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist and has analgesic activity. Its clearance rate is significantly less than that of ketamine. Therefore, it represents a better candidate for a transdermal delivery system. Prior to consideration for use in a transdermal system the analgesic properties of norketamine in a preclinical model of neuropathic pain needs to be evaluated. Locomotor activity will also be studied to verify that analgesia is not due to depression in motor function or sedation. The purpose of this proposal is to characterize the analgesic properties of norketamine as an initial feasibility study to provide a basis for its future use as an analgesic in a transdermal system. The enantiomers of norketamine will also be studied. Analgesic potency and side effect differences have been seen with the enantiomers of ketamine and are likely to occur with norketamine. The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the analgesic properties of S-, R- and RS- norketamine in response to thermal and mechanical stimuli in a rat model of neuropathic pain and 2) characterize the effect of S-, R- and RS- norketamine on activity level in intact rats. Findings from this Phase I study are important to the long-term goal (Phase II studies) of developing a clinically useful transdermal analgesic drug (norketamine enantiomer) suitable for the management of chronic neuropathic pain."

However, in addition to nicotine, smokers are exposed to nornicotine both in the form of a tobacco alkaloid and as a metabolite that results from biotransformation of nicotine. Using an animal model of tobacco smoking in humans, we have found that nornicotine is self-administered in rats and that nornicotine pretreatment is effective in reducing nicotine self-administration. In addition, repeated administration of S(-)-nornicotine, but not R(+)-nornicotine, increases locomotor activity. In the current project, our overall hypothesis is that S(-)-nornicotine will be more potent than R(+)-nornicotine in selectively decreasing nicotine self-administration across repeated injections. The specific aims will determine if the nornicotine enantiomers differ in their ability to (1) dose dependently decrease nicotine self-administration, (2) dose-dependently decrease sucrose-reinforced responding, and (3) decrease nicotine self-administration or sucrose-reinforced responding across repeated injections. Rats will be trained to self-administer nicotine to a stable rate and then will be pretreated with varying doses of either S(-)- or R(+)-nornicotine. To determine the specificity of the decrease in nicotine self- administration, separate groups of rats will be trained to respond for sucrose reinforcement and will be pretreated with varying doses of either S(-)- or R(+)-nornicotine. In another experiment, rats will be pretreated repeatedly with either S(-)- or R(+)-nornicotine and tested for nicotine self-administration or sucrose-reinforced responding, thus assessing if effect of each nornicotine enantiomer is long-lasting or transient.

This project proposes to utilize this initial planting to evaluate the technical and financial feasibility of cultivating Yaupon Holly for it food value. Specifically the project will: 1) Characterize clonal plantings of Yaupon on the YWC Pilot Farm from chemical and agronomic perspective. 2)Compile plantation establishment and production costs together with yields through one production cycle of the pilot plantation. 3)Utilize the above data to develop a preliminary enterprise budget for Yaupon production based on actual establishment and production costs. 4) Begin development of an outreach plan for recruiting and training potential growers.Successful achievement of these objectives will result in the development of a baseline dataset of Yaupon properties that will be used to evaluate the effects of treatments and make a preliminary determination of financial feasibility. In addition, an outreach plan focused on small farmers will be developed with the assistance of extension and small farm specialists. Assuming a successful outcome to Phase I, Phase II will expand production research and optimize the production system through at least two additional cycles. Phase II will also evaluate the feasibility of an on-farm processing facility and fully develop outreach and training programs including a plan for mentoring new growers through their first production cycle. Phase III will commercialize the research by partnering with existing small farm outreach efforts to present the plan to growers with the goal of establishing 100 acres of Yaupon food production during the first three years.Benefits from a successful project include enhanced profitability and farm diversity for growers, a higher quality, more reliable source of Yaupon raw material for processors, enhanced consumer safety and satisfaction, and positive environmental effects through a reduction in the need to wild collect Yaupon to meet increasing market demand."

We propose to develop a novel non-contact, label-free multimodality imager that provides real-time intraoperative
identification of nerves within the surgical field-of-view to facilitate the prevention of unintended nerve damage
(termed iatrogenic nerve injury) during surgical procedures, as they are a major source of postsurgical
complications, e.g., chronic pain. In the United States chronic pain management is a major putative contributing
factor in the current opioid-related drug overdose epidemic. Annually, over 45 million surgical procedures are
performed in the United States and an estimated 10% to 50% of them result in patient chronic postoperative pain
outcomes. Though not all the at least 4.5 million are definitively ascribable to iatrogenic nerve injury, it
nonetheless represents a significant recurring annual healthcare problem. Relatedly, analysis of large-scale
nerve lesion treatment studies reveals that 25%, 60% and 94% respectively of sciatic, femoral and accessory
nerve lesions addressed are caused by iatrogenic nerve injury.
Additionally, iatrogenic nerve injury features prominently in post-surgical quality of life issues that range from
loss of sensation and motor function, to the aforementioned chronic pain, and morbidity. Reportedly, 2-3 years
post radical prostatectomy ~60% of men are still impotent as a result of damaged cavernous nerves. Likewise,
20% - 60% of mastectomy breast cancer treatment survivors suffer chronic post-surgical pain that significantly
reduces their quality of life, and injury to the intercostobrachial nerve is the primary cause. Even in surgeries with
minimal neural damage risk like acoustic neuroma removal (andlt;1%), spinal scoliosis surgery (andlt;0.6%), and
thyroidectomy (andlt;2-3.8%) the consequences of nerve damage can be severe: leading to deafness, paraplegia,
and even death respectively. The associated financial implications of iatrogenic nerve damage are significant.
There are direct financial costs to the individual due to loss of employment and/or income, and to the healthcare
industry as nerve damage is a common source of litigation with compensation being awarded in 82% of cases
of spinal accessory nerve injury, for an example. The exposure of healthcare personnel and providers to
medicolegal liability is extensive as Iatrogenic nerve injuries are commonly reported on the laryngeal nerve
during thyroid operations, trigeminal nerve and inferior alveolar nerve during facial and oral surgeries, intercostal
nerves during thoracic surgeries, and on the spinal accessory nerves, common peroneal nerve, superficial radial
nerve, and genitofemoral nerve branches during various other surgeries. Consequently, as of 2015, medicolegal
litigation risk was a primary driver for a $2.2 billion global market for intraoperative nerve monitoring projected to
grow annually at 4.79% until 2025. Our proposed solution targets filling both the deficiencies of currently available
options and the growing demand by introducing an effective, commercially viable product.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Unintended nerve damage during surgical procedures is a significant and costly public healthcare delivery
problem and current methods for injury prevention via intraoperative nerve monitoring leave substantial room
for improvement. The ramifications of increased healthcare costs due to associated medical-liability issues and
the significant reductions in quality of life issues, including the burgeoning chronic pain management related
opioid-related drug overdose epidemic, make addressing this very impactful to society. The proposed
development will yield an effective, commercially viable, non-contact multimodality imager that provides real-
time intraoperative identification of nerves within the surgical field-of-view to facilitate the prevention of
unintended nerve damage during surgical procedures."

We envision taking Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) as the foundational methodology for the proposed effort. IGA has this rare combination of accuracy and robustness, which we feel is critical for high-fidelity mechanics modeling for mobility applications. However, mesh generation in the IGA is not as established and straightforward as mesh generation in the classical methods such as the finite differences and finite elements.

The proposed project promises to result in improved wellbeing of infants and young children in the context of a public/private partnership between a newly formed small business, a College of Engineering and a major Health Sciences Center. By making vital sign monitoring available to every family with a low-cost semiconductor system-on-chip, it can be a game-changing product for the baby monitor market. The proposed technology points to other novel uses such as a detection of epileptic seizures and subsequent research in predicting sleep apnea, Parkinson?s disease, as well as non-medical applications such as remote monitoring of search-and-rescue for earthquake, fire victims; border patrol; entrance security; and see-through-wall radar. A successful result will contribute to the growth of the company, U.S. and global sales, and the economic competitiveness of the U.S. The proposed project will develop and demonstrate an alternative to current monitors which require contact with the baby. It will integrate a novel on-chip solution into a low-cost portable device for long-term monitoring of vital signs without baby contact. The objective is to design a chip in a commercial complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process to ensure low cost and low-power. The research will focus on radar non-contact measurement of physiological movements caused by breathing and heartbeat. Research will also be conducted on designing an antenna array to send a radio frequency signal, which will be reflected back from the human body and phase-modulated by physiological movements due to heartbeat and respiration. The result will be beam steering radar with a compact size and will eliminate the null detection point, so that detection of the vital sign activity will not be affected by either the position of the infant or the radar residue phase. The mass production cost of such a device will be significantly lower than currently employed systems."

The applications include studies of human infectious diseases (hepatitis B and B, malaria etc.), drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, drug-drug interactions, toxicology and gene therapy among others. In the current human chimeric liver models up to 90% of hepatocytes are of human origin and displayall the typical functions of mature human cells. Our company uses immune deficient fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah) knockout mice[2], bearing additional mutations in Rag2 and the interleukin common gamma chain receptor (Il2rg) designated as FRGN to generate such chimeric animals. Human hepatocytes from commercial vendors are transplanted into the animals and over time the human hepatocytes replace the mouse cells generating chimeric animals with livers that constitute 90% human cells. Currently, hepatocytes are the only human cell type present in FRGN chimeric livers and this represents a limitation for some applications of the model. Specifically, hematopoietic cell types are known to contribute significantly to liver biology, including pathobiology. Inflammation is present in many settings, particularly in liver infections, but also chemical injuries. Furthermore, the liver macrophages (Kupffer cells) are important players in liver toxicology. All of the hematopoietic cells in the current generation ofchimeric FRGN mice are of murine origin and they are completely deficient in T- and B-cells rendering the in sufficient for the afore mentioned studies. Chimeric mice bearing significant percentages of all human hematopoietic cells can be readily generated by transplantation of human cord blood into immune deficient mice, including Rag2/Il2rg/Nod mice. In this application we propose to optimize a protocol that permits the efficient generation of double- chimeric FRGN mice, with high levels of human hematopoiesis as well as high percentages of liver repopulation. Aim 1: To optimize a transplant protocol in FRGN mice which reproducibly yields gt70% human chimerism in both the liver and blood. 1a) Different time points for transplantation and different protocols or conditioning by irradiation will be compared using a single human hepatocyte donor. 2a) the two best protocols will be applied to 3 additional hepatocyte donors validate and further optimize the procedure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug metabolism is phenotypically specific and can vary significantly between individuals of the same species and the variance between individuals can be attributed to genetic differences in the expression and activity of liver enzymes responsible for the metabolismof the drugs as well as significant contributions by the immune system in response to the metabolites produced by the liver. Yecuris Corporation has developed an in vivo genetic selection system (the FRG KO mouse) that permits extensive humanization of murine liver by transplanted human hepatocytes. With the addition of a humanized hematopoietic system in conjunction with the humanized liver, the new dual chimeric model could revolutionize development and screening of therapeutics in addition to providingmodels for studying hepatic infectious diseases."

While new transgenic and knockout rodent models of liver disease have facilitated basic research, the development of bioengineered large animal models of liver disease has been problematic. To address the shortage of large animal models, we have utilized a novel strategy combining gene targeting by recombinant adeno-associated virus DJ serotype (rAAVdj) and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) for the production of bioengineered pigs. Our prototypemodel is hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) accomplished by knocking out the gene coding for fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) in pigs. In humans, FAH deficiency is associated with a unique phenotype, which includes metabolic derangement (tyrosinemia),acute liver failure, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In mice, FAH deficiency combined with immune modulation has been used to produce mice with humanized livers (Azuma 2007 Nature Biotechnology; Bissig 2010 J Clinical Investigation). TheseFAH deficient mice serve as in vivo bioreactors for the robust expansion of normal human hepatocytes. We postulate that scale up of the FAH deficient platform to pigs is possible, and that FAH deficient pigs will also serve as surrogate hosts for much larger scale in vivo expansion of normal human hepatocytes. An abundant supply of human hepatocytes is needed for applications including toxicity testing of new drugs, human hepatocyte transplantation, and cell- based liver support devices such as the bioartificial liver. With regard to commercialization of this novel technology, we have already produced Fah-null heterozygote female pigs by rAAVdj and SCNT methodology. This phase 1 STTR (R41) application will establish a herd of FAH-deficient pigs and characterize the phenotype of Fah-null homozygote pigs. In future phase 2 studies, FAH-deficient pigs will be evaluated as in vivo bioreactors for the large-scale production of human hepatocytes. We expect that the FAH-deficient pig will serve as a valuable resource for the development of novel therapeutic modalities and to facilitate translational research in the field o liver disease. Furthermore, the rAAVdj and SCNT methodology may be utilized to produce other bioengineered large animal models of human disease.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the current research program is to develop a bioengineered pig with the metabolic disorder of human hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1). Phase 1 studies are designed to establish a herd of HT1 pigs and characterize the phenotype of these pigs. Phase 2 studies will determine if HT1 pigs can serve as in vivo bioreactors for large scale production of human hepatocytes. There are many therapeutic applications for normal human hepatocytes such as a cell-source in a bioartificial liver or for hepatocyte transplantation in humans, or industrial applications for safety and toxicity screening, or for use by pharmaceutical companies in the drug discovery process. Thus the demand for these new pigs is worthy of commercialization."

We have developed technology to massively expand fully functional primary human hepatocytes by serial transplantation in immune deficient FRGN mice in vivo. Hepatocytes isolated from these animals are highly viable and functional. Cell farming in FRGN mice allows the production of an unlimited supply of human hepatocytes for research in toxicology, drug metabolism, infectious disease, and cancer biology. The aims of this application are to optimize the isolation and storage of farmed hepatocytes and to fully validate their utility in comparison to the currently available cells. Once fully validated, these cells are going to be valuable in the commercial market.

In order to make our platform more attractive to commercial customers and more commercially viable (reduced production cost per mouse), it will be necessary to reproducibly achieve high humanization levels in the majority of mice. In this phase 1 STTR application we propose 2 specific aims to advance our goal of reliable liver humanization: 1) We will test different background strains of mice for their ability to support high level liver repopulation. 2) The effects of different regimens to deplete/inhibit hepatic Kupffer cells on repopulation levels will be ascertained.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The animal model is an attractive novel system for modeling human drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics at an early stage of drug development. Commercialization of our technology will greatly reduce the cost of and accelerate new drug development, thus contributing to public health."

Despite advances in electronic displays society still uses tons of paper. Printing and copying remain ubiquitous. In 2013 the United States consumed 3.6 million tons of office copy paper, which according to the EPA?s Waste Reduction Model (WARM) added the equivalent of 28.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. However, paper copies are only needed temporarily and most of that 3.6 million tons of paper is discarded or recycled within a few days. A reputed survey found that 21% of hardcopies are discarded the same day they are made. With the technology of Self-Erasing Inkjet Ink, the paper used for temporary hardcopies reverts to a blank sheet and can be re-used like new paper. In all subsequent uses the paper is pollution-free. For every 1% of the inkjet ink market captured by self-erasing ink, carbon emissions are reduced by 17 thousand metric tons per year, thereby supporting national goals of reducing pollution, conserving resources, and fighting climate change. The intellectual merit of this project lies in the development of a novel self-erasing ink for inkjet printing and photocopying. The water-based ink derives its color from an acid-base indicator which is dark blue in an alkaline solution but otherwise colorless. The ink is alkaline so it is colored when printed. After printing the ink begins to self-erase due to a neutralization reaction with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. When the reaction is completed the ink is colorless and the paper appears as new. The project will leverage existing, unmodified inkjet printer/copiers and ink cartridges. This project will address remaining technical challenges in making the ink compatible with existing printers which were not designed for this type of ink chemistry. Specifically the project will determine how to ensure the ink does not clog the inkjet nozzles between infrequent printing sessions. The additives used for this purpose in conventional inks are not necessarily compatible with self-erasing ink chemistry and new ways to prevent clogging will be developed during the project. The anticipated results from this effort will be an ink that approximates the print quality and reliability of conventional ink but also self-erases."

In addition, federal programs promoting alternative technologies are often focused on urban areas, with limited resources to address rural differences in scale, capacity, and financial resources. Furthermore, technologies are always changing and improving, making it difficult to keep up with them. Yellow Wood Associates is offering an assessment approach to small communities that compares the performance, cost and capacity of existing and proposed rural community municipal infrastructure with the performance, cost and capacity of alternative technologies and approaches. Our systematic assessment process helps communities in formulating cost-effective plans for phased implementation of appropriate alternatives. Plus, we can take communities from assessment to implementation by connecting them with companies and methods of financing. Rural communities can benefit from the Green Community Technologies service through cost savings, cost avoidance, potential creation of new employment opportunities, and environmental benefits."

ROBERT M. HUNTER,,() -,,,,,,"This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will advance a novel anaerobic bioprocess forliberating precious metals from metal-sulfide ores. As near-surface, oxidized ore reserves are depleted,gold producers are increasingly faced with the challenge of extracting gold and other metal values fromsulfidic ores that are refractory to conventional processing techniques. This often puts mining concernsat odds with forest and agricultural interests. At present, when the demand is high for more cost-effective and environmentally-friendly ore processing options, bioprocessing as currently implementedis considered impractical for large-scale applications for three reasons: (1) slurry cooling requirementson the order of megawatts, (2) difficulties in delivering oxygen into slurries at very high rates, and (3)excessive neutralization of reagent costs and sludge production. This research will employ the tools ofthe bioprocess engineering discipline to overcome these issues. It will encourage widespread adoptionof a bioprocess that is more energy efficient and environmentally acceptable than the alternatives,roasting and autoclaving, which significantly impact air and water resources. Based on thethermodynamics and microbiology of each step in the bioprocess, kinetic and stoichiometric modelswill be developed.

The goal of this work is to develop an inexpensive, ultra-fast, minimally-invasive medical test to sequence and
quantitate small RNAs from biological fluids. Small RNAs, shorter than 200 nucleotides (nt) comprise several
groups of non-coding RNAs with preserved regulatory functions. Small RNAs are abundant and surprisingly
stable in blood/urine. Current literature is flooded with studies identifying such small RNAs as reliable
biomarkers for most diseases. These studies suggest that a comprehensive small RNA panel will reflect the
health/aging status of an individual, response to stress, changes in medication, onset and/or progress of
disease. Current small RNA profiling assays are expensive, involve extensive infrastructure, and employ time-
consuming and error-prone sample preparation. These assays also miss or misidentify post-transcriptionally
modified bases (PTM) which are known to influence RNA stability, specificity, and function. On the contrary,
nanopore-based technologies promise inexpensive portable devices, direct RNA profiling including
identification of PTM bases, and fast assay turn-around. Still the only commercially available nanopore-based
device(s) from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) are not qualified to sequence RNAs shorter than 200
bases. Such limitation prevents sequencing of most, if not all, non-coding RNAs found in biological fluids, and
limits the usability of nanopore technology in minimally-invasive medical diagnostic assays.
We will use commercially available nanopore devices and optimize the testing conditions in order to profile
small RNAs in biological fluids. Yenos Analytical LLC is singled out for such effort, as we have developed
proprietary technology to selectively tag RNAs with a bulky Osmium label. The bulky label slows down the
voltage-driven translocation of these RNA surrogates via a nanopore, and yields a readable ion current vs
time (i-t) signal that serves as the fingerprint of the specific RNA molecule. Recent work funded by a Phase I
SBIR NHGRI grant has also shown that some of the slowest translocations of these tagged RNAs using the
ONT device(s) embody sequencing information. In order to increase the number of the slow events, we will
exploit non-covalent probes that bind RNA. This binding will reduce the effective negative charge of the RNA
molecule, and slowly release it under the influence of the voltage drop in proximity to the nanoporeâs entry. As
non-covalent probes, we will evaluate cationic polyamines such as spermidine and spermine, cationic
peptides, and RNA binding proteins. The combination of nucleic acid selective labeling technology with
nanopore-device based detection is novel, and single-handedly carried out by Yenos Analytical LLC. We
propose to optimize this combination of technologies towards profiling small RNAs from biological fluids. Such
a medical assay will directly impact medical testing, prevention, diagnosis, and cure of disease, materialize
the promise of personalized medicine, reduce the ballooning cost of health care, and enable diagnostic
medical tests in remote locations with minimal infrastructure.PROJECT NARRATIVE: An explosion in recent studies solidifies the importance of small
RNAs in biological fluids as disease biomarkers. Advances in personalized medicine for
diagnosis and treatment of disease require minimally-invasive, inexpensive, ultra-fast
medical tests. Nanopore-based devices are commercially available, portable and
inexpensive. If contrived to provide high accuracy in identification and quantitation of
small RNAs from biological fluids, as described in this proposal, these nanopore-based
devices will revolutionize personalized medicine and reduce the cost of health care."

As a result, a new disciplinenuclear forensic sciencehas been developed to support tracking, testing, and forensic analysis of nuclear material. Obviously, nuclear forensic material samples are extremely valuable and must be safeguarded to avoid loss or misidentification, which drives the need for durable labeling that is compatible with computer barcode and RFID tracking systems.  Unfortunately, current label printing technologies have limited durability and cannot be applied to substrates of interest including glass jars and polyethylene bags. To address these limitations, YewSavin, Inc. proposes a patent-sensitive Hot Inkjet Printing (HIP) technology (Figure 1) that combines commercial off-the-shelf handheld inkjet printing technology with a new class of UV-cured ink. UV light instantly activates and sets the jetted ink, which is a mixture of liquids that can include metal compounds tailored for durability, electrical conductivity, strength, and adhesion to a wide range of substrates over time and in austere environments. The UV system is also designed to minimize heating for compatibility with temperature-sensitive substrates like glass jars and polyethylene sample storage bags. Finally, the technology can print conventional barcode patterns and/or RFID tags for computer-aided sample tracking during nuclear forensic sample acquisition activities. The HIP process was invented by YewSavins founder, Dr. Makarand Gore the former Principal Scientist of HPs Inkjet Business Unit and inventor of HPs current family of commercial inkjet inks. During Phase I, Dr. Gore and his YewSavin team will work with its engineering subcontractor i2C Solutions, Inc to validate the HIP process through fabrication and testing of a proof-of-concept unit incorporating a commercially available handheld inkjet printer. Significant effort will be placed on development of liquid HIP ink that meets a minimum set of requirements for the nuclear forensics community to be established jointly with DOE, NNSA, and FBI stakeholders at the outset of the project.  Durability tests will be conducted on substrates of interest and results will be used to define specific objectives of Phase II."

However, the spectroscopic performance of current, large-volume Cadmium 10% Zinc Telluride, Cd0.9Zn0.1Te, (CZT) detectors is not sufficient for detection scenarios requiring reliable radioisotope identification. The deficiency has been linked to the cumulative effect of tellurium precipitates (secondary phases) presented in CZT single-crystal. The random nature of the interaction prevents the use of any electronic or digital charge correction techniques, without a significant reduction in the detector efficiency. This project will develop a heat treatment for CZT crystals to eliminate the tellurium precipitates. The careful control of the temperatures and atmosphere of the annealing process will chemically convert the tellurium precipitates without disturbing the crystalline structure.

Radionuclide imaging is an important tool for observing physiological processes within the brain and other organs. Traditional radionuclide imaging systems rely on scintillator-based detectors. Wide bandgap semiconductors such as cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) offer significant advantages over scintillator-based systems including superior energy and spatial resolution, compactness, and better signal to noise ratio. To date, most detector grade CZT is grown by the High Pressure Bridgman (HPB) technique in U.S.A. Detector grade material is costly because of low yields. Imarad (Israel) is making large-size CZT using low presure horizontal Bridgman technique with lower price, but the CZT with very low resistivity will increase the detector noice. The goal of the Phase II project is to optimize an alternative crystal growth method, the modified vertical Bridgman (MVB) technique, for growing larger size and lower cost CZT for nuclear imaging in united states. Thus, the specific aims of the Phase II research are:

 Modified Vertical Bridgman Technique is proposed for use in making hybrid
 arrays for high-resolution X-and gamma-ray imaging cameras, and making for
 diagnosis of heart disease, detection of tumors, genetics, bone scans,
 fluoroscopy, and cognitive neuroscience. Preliminary results are shown to
 exhibit excellent crystalline quality, high electron resistively and
 mobility-lifetime products for both electrons and holes have been obtained and
 selected at random from ingots at SNL (l-4). Pixilated arrays fabricated at
 Technion (5) exhibit excellent spectral performance. High-resolution photo
 peaks are observed without any pulse processing or compensation techniques.
 Spectrometers, operated at 400V, and realized on 20x20x5mm3 substrate, exhibit
 3 percent resolution for l22keV photons with excellent peak-to valley ratio,
 excellent counting efficiency and low leakage current. We propose to future
 study, optimize and develop CZT growth technique. We believe that this
 development will provide larger size wafers (40x40x5 mm3) and higher yield of
 CZT single crystals with lower cost, and will represent a significant advance
 towards the economic feasibility of high-resolution room-temperature gamma
 cameras for nuclear medicine.
 PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:
 The proposed large-size CZT crystals produced by the MVB technique are needed for
 production of room-temperature high-resolution solid-state imaging cameras. The
 proposed technique is expected to provide better energy resolution and a low-cost
 alternative to the current growth technique, and if successful, it will enable a broad
 range of medical applications. This development will also open new opportunities
 for use of the technology for environmental monitoring, baggage scanning and national
 security applications."

This issue has kept many voice technologies out of both the mobile and IoT markets. It is expected that the company's unique artificial intelligence platform will deliver a fully scalable, real-time software solution. Solving this challenge will make the currently noisy world of smartphones more realistic for voice technologies (like voice authentication) that to date have avoided the space. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project concerns a novel technology that is the result of innovatively combining advanced signal processing, broadcast studio methodologies, and artificial intelligence techniques to perform aggressive separation of voice from background voices and sounds. It also automatically repairs the biometrics of the separated voice signals on the basis of empirically formulated signal-dependent rules. The technology has already been demonstrated through informal tests to be significantly better than existing technologies in separating two-person conversations from highly overlapped background voices and sounds captured on a pair of closely spaced (few centimeters) omnidirectional microphones. This SBIR Phase I project seeks to firmly establish the clear superiority of this technology over any other existing voice separation technology. The ultimate goal of the project is to demonstrate that when the proposed technology is properly optimized as a frontend to state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition or state-of-the-art automatic speaker recognition, the recognition error rates in noisy multi-voice environments are comparable to those obtained in noiseless single-voice environments."

Since they have the potential to be faster than a foot soldier on smooth terrain and more maneuverable than a tank orjeep on rough terrain, they promise to be a capable middle ground platform. However, to date, no one has developed a practical legged robot that can run quickly, maneuver over rough terrain, and operate from an on-board power source.To bridge this gap, Yobotics proposes to determine the feasibility of an unmanned Quadrupedal Ground Vehicle that can gallop, trot, walk, and jump. This robot will be able to scramble over extremely rough terrain, jump over holes and small obstacles, andrun at speeds up to 20 mph on level ground. To achieve high running speeds, the robot will use a galloping gait, as these speeds are unachievable with a trotting gait. For many applications in the military, law enforcement, and space exploration market, the ability to maneuver over extremely rough terrain is of the utmost importance. The proposed legged robot will fill the mission-critical customer need of truemobility in rough and variable terrain.There are numerous advantages of the proposed robot with respect to traditional wheeled and tracked robots:ÃÂ¿ The proposed robot will be able to run smoothly and quickly over moderately rough terrain, with obstacle heights on the order of 25% the robot's height. A typical wheeled or tracked robot would find this terrain difficult to traverse and therefore moves lowly through it.ÃÂ¿  The robot will be able to jump over ditches that are longer than the robot itself. Traditional wheeled vehicles can only clear gaps smaller than the size of any individual wheel and traditional tracked vehicles can only clear gaps about half the length of a track.ÃÂ¿The robot will be able to jump over obstacles that are taller than the robot itself. Traditional wheeled and tracked vehicles can only clear a height on the order of the size of the vehicle's tracks or wheels.ÃÂ¿ The robot will be able to run up stairs quickly and maneuver quickly through environments designed around legged humans.ÃÂ¿  The robot will be able to maneuver in extremely tight situations by turning in place. Traditional wheeled vehicles require room to turn, while traditional tracked vehicles cause a lot of ground scraping when turning in place."

they are often able to comfortably maintain a conversation in quiet environments. However, in group
environments, such as a large family dinner, restaurant, or other environment where multiple people are talking
simultaneously, hearing-impaired listeners have great difficulty participating in conversations and frequently
withdraw or avoid the situation. As such, it would be highly beneficial to implement an algorithm into HAs or CIs
to remove background talkers (âbabbleâ) from the signal to reduce listening effort for the hearing-impaired
listener and allow them to converse as if they were in a quiet environment. Although HAs and CIs frequently
incorporate noise reduction algorithms, these algorithms are not effective when the background is babble. The
problem of removing babble involves segregating speech from speech. Hence, the spectral properties of the
signal and noise are extremely similar.Despite these challenges, we developed an extremely effective algorithm named SEDA to remove
background babble. A prototype of SEDA was implemented on an iPhone and evaluated on 10 CI users.
SEDA improved understanding of speech with background talkers at all signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) tested;
on average, word understanding in babble improved by 31 percentage points. By contrast, the state-of-the-art
noise reduction systems for CIs provide little to no benefit for understanding speech with babble noise.CI manufacturers have shown great enthusiasm about our successful proof-of-concept of our algorithm.
Nevertheless, before commercialization, CI manufacturers want reductions in the computational power
required for the algorithm. As CI processors minimize computational processing in order to maximize battery
life, it is important to minimize the additional computations required by SEDA. When using SEDA as a front-
end for a CI processing strategy (as is the case with our iPhone prototype), redundancy in the required
calculations result in increased computations and latency. Specifically, SEDA decomposes the input signal into
multiple channels, removes the background babble, and then reassembles them into a single waveform. This
waveform is then fed into a CI which again decomposes the signal into multiple channels. Integrating SEDA
into the signal processing chain will save computational processing as the signal would only need to be
decomposed once and would not need to be reassembled. Additionally, although SEDA is highly successful in
typical speech in noise tests, CI manufacturers emphasized the importance of evaluating SEDA in more
realistic environments.Two specific aims will address the requirements for commercialization by the CI manufactures:
reducing the computational requirements by integrating SEDA into a sound processing algorithm and
evaluating SEDA in realistic environments.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Understanding speech when other people talking in the background is both one of the most critical and difficult
issues to address for cochlear implant users. In contrast to commercial algorithms, our proof-of-concept
algorithm is highly successful at removing background talkers. The goal of this research is to modify and
further evaluate the algorithm such that it is ready for commercialization."

The activated sludge process the modern method to treat sewerage was developed in the early 1900 to prevent the spread of disease as people moved to the cities during the industrial revolution and waterborne disease caused many deaths. Activated sludge relies on a biological process to remove suspended solids from wastewater for treatment so clean water or effluent is returned to surface waters for human and environmental use. Bulking or foaming occurs when certain culprit bacteria grow out of proportion to total bacteria, resulting in raw sewerage being discharged with the effluent. An extreme event can cost a wastewater treatment plant several hundreds of thousands of dollars in compliance fines, damage to plant or equipment, and operational costs. Broader economic costs occur if beaches or marinas are closed during an event. Early detection of bulking and foaming events will provide for powerful tools to facilitate more effective operation of wastewater treatment plants. The objective of this Phase 1 research project is to develop a molecular test using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) techniques that can be done on site by wastewater treatment plant (WTTP) personnel to provide early warning of bulking and foaming events - up to three weeks advance warning allowing WWTP operators to take preventative action to avoid economic costs, loss of energy production and threats to public health. Bulking and foaming is caused by 28 culprit bacteria. Currently the industry relies on microscopy which is subjective; requires significant study and training; and provides at most a day or two of warning -not enough time for preventative action. In reality, most often, detection is not made until the WWTP begins bulking or foaming. The proposed diagnostic tools to be developed in this project will investigate molecular identification techniques to specifically target these bacteria and provide an analytical test that yields real time results at reasonable costs to help effectively operate and optimize processes in wastewater treatment plants."

The GPS-SP will be a self-contained military Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) module. It will securely communicate with the Android operating system platform, which is planned for use in the new US Army Handheld Computing Environment (Handheld CE). This will decouple the GPS receiver from the handset, allowing each technology to evolve separately, while still ensuring standards-based data-centric interoperability between them. The result will be a more open-architecture approach, enabling flexibility, innovation, and cost-savings over the current DAGR-centric military GPS paradigm. In addition, the GPS-SP will be versatile enough to allow secure connections to other sensors, and will have a natural migration path to future MGUE M-Code receivers. Because of our previous experience integrating SAASM PPS P(Y) GPS receivers -- along with prior work on Android and other embedded/real-time operating systems -- we are confident that we can accomplish this ambitious challenge.

The government receives 150,000 new disability claims each year for acoustic trauma even as disability payments exceed $2 billion per year. If the current trend continues hearing loss will become further widespread and the demand for hearing protection will intensify. Traditionally, hearing protection devices are treated as an afterthought because people are not aware of the real risks associated with high noise exposure, including tinnitus and hearing loss. To make the problem even worse, hearing protection devices (HPDs) are generally considered unfashionable, aesthetically unappealing, and detrimental to music appreciation according to numerous sources (Bessete,Â Bogoch, et al.,Kraft,2005; Vogel, et al., 2007). Specifically, Bogoch et al. state, âIndividuals who were concerned about their appearance while wearing hearing protection were found in the logistic modeling to be less likely to wear hearing protection even if provided free at the door.â Currently, military personnel are often exposed to hazardous noise levels, while combat experience increases the risk of permanent hearing loss by 63% (Wells, et al 2015).

We are seeking funding to test the cardio protective effects of a novel new protein kinase C epsilon (PKCÎµ)
inhibitor (YT-002) and a novel protein kinase C beta II (PKCÎ²II) inhibitor (YT-004) in the setting of porcine
myocardial ischemia reperfusion (I/R) in vivo when given at the beginning of reperfusion. There currently is no
approved pharmacological treatment/preventative for the I/R injury. We are fully aware of the past failures in this
area. Literally all previous attempts have taken the oxygen free radical scavenging approach. We believe this
underlies, at least in part, the reason there have been no successful pharmacological therapeutics for cardiac
I/R injury to date. Once reactive oxygen species are generated the damage is immediate and scavenging is
ineffective. Our approach â never been tried before â is to inhibit the generation of reactive oxygen species thus
preventing their damage during reperfusion. Interviews we conducted with 22 interventional cardiologists
overwhelmingly support the idea that such preservation of myocardial tissue and function would represent a
significant long-term benefit to the patients experiencing ischemia-reperfusion injury leading to a decrease in the
incidence of heart failure. Previous data from our lab with another compound YT-001 (identical mechanism of
action as YT-002) demonstrated a significant inhibition of hydrogen peroxide generation in vivo, and a
remarkable sparing of tissue damage and cardiac function post reperfusion in both the ex vivo rat I/R heart and
the in vivo porcine myocardial I/R model. However, YT-001 has limited solubility and remaining patent life. Our
new molecules (YT-002 and YT-004) have dramatically improved solubility, potency and new patent life. We
have already demonstrated impressive infarct size reduction and cardiac function protection in isolated rat I/R
hearts with YT-002 and YT-004. In this proposal, we will evaluate the cardio protective effects of YT-002 and
YT-004 on ischemia reperfusion in the Gorman pig model (19). In addition to the animalâs vital signs, ejection
fraction (measured by echocardiography) will be monitored (as an index of cardiac function/contractility) as well
as cardiac proteins (e.g., troponin I) as an index of tissue damage throughout the protocol. Three hours after
reperfusion, the hearts will be excised, and stained for direct assessment of cardiac damage (infarct size).
Immunohistochemistry on frozen heart sections will be performed in Dr. Youngâs lab at PCOM to detect PKCÎµ
and PKCÎ²II localization. Based upon previously generated pig heart data with the PKCÎµ inhibitor YT-001, we
expect to see a dramatic in vivo preservation of cardiac tissue and function compared to animals receiving
scrambled peptide control. These positive data will provide additional justification for performing longer-term
animal efficacy studies and eventually Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies in support of human
clinical trials.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Ischemia reperfusion injury is a phenomenon that occurs when oxygenated blood is reintroduced into ischemic
tissue. When the cardiac surgeon re-opens a clogged coronary artery that caused a heart attack, the re-
introduction of oxygenated blood causes further additional damage. This ischemia reperfusion injury can be
responsible for as much as 60% of the damage left to the heart. Our molecules inhibit the pathways that lead to
reperfusion injury, preserve cardiac function and minimize reperfusion damage. To date there are no
pharmacological therapies to prevent this, and an effective therapeutic would minimize heart attack damage,
preserve heart function and reduce the incidence of heart failure in heart attack patients."

The goal of the project is to test the efficacy of a protein kinase C epsilon peptide inhibitor (YT-001) in kidney
ischemia reperfusion (I/R) in vivo (in mice) when given at the beginning of reperfusion. Injury and tissue
damage associated with I/R in the kidney is a well-recognized phenomenon notably post kidney transplant.
There are 20,000 kidney transplants per year in the US and twenty five percent of transplant recipients
experience delayed graft function (DGF) within one week, a direct consequence of I/R. Currently, the only
treatment for DGF is palliative support by managing fluid and electrolyte levels via dialysis; however, these
measures provide only palliative care. Dr. Young has shown several cardiac I/R models both in-vivo and ex-
vivo that giving YT-001 at the beginning of reperfusion restores organ function and reduces cell death. The
FDA has recognized that the exact same mechanisms are at play in DGF. Phase 1 project is planned to study
the effect of YT-001 in a murine bilateral kidney I/R model to different lengths of ischemia, and reperfusion will
be carried out up to four days. During this time, serum plasma creatinine will be monitored as an index for
kidney function. This proposed methodology best mimics the settings of I/R injury seen in DGF patients.
Monitoring the role of YT-001 is crucial in the drug development process for treatment of DGF in post renal
transplant patients. After phase 1, we can begin testing the effects of YT-001 in Phase 2 (murine kidney
transplant model), which will support an IND and subsequent clinical trials.PROJECR NARRATIVE
The goal of the project is to develop a therapeutic capable of preventing delayed graft function (DGF) in the
setting of post renal transplantation. DGF is a post renal transplant condition that currently has no cure and
affects a quarter of kidney transplant recipients. Using a well-recognized model of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R),
YT-001, a PKC-epsilon inhibitor, given at the beginning of reperfusion, resulted in a robust reduction in infarct
size and restoration of post-reperfused cardiac function in porcine cardiac I/R in vivo. The goal will be to

Our long-term goal is to commercialize hyaluronan enhanced polymeric transcatheter aortic valves (HAPTAVs)
that have the durability of surgically implanted mechanical valves, do not require life-long anticoagulation, avoid
the emerging problems for tissue-based TAVs, and are made from low-cost, synthetic materials using automated
manufacturing. A novel biomaterial, made of engineering plastic (polyethylene) that, at a molecular level, is
interlocked with a naturally occurring biomolecule (hyaluronan or HA) is used to make highly hydrophilic,
blood-friendly polymer leaflets with the durability of engineered synthetic polymers. In both the laboratory and in
live sheep, these valves have shown excellent hemodynamic performance and durability without any thrombus
formation or calcification. With this Phase I application we aim to demonstrate that the long-term durability,
hemodynamics, and performance of the HAPTAVs meet or exceed international standards, and take the initial
steps toward developing a commercialization strategy to position the business for Phase II SBIR and Series A
funding. We will use our current Phase I Design prototype HAPTAVs in both Aims 1 and 2. Aim 1 will have
independent entities test the long-term fatigue and hemodynamic performance according to international (ISO)
standards. Aim 2 will work with a standard industry contract research organization (NAMSA) to prepare an FDA
pre-submission and regulatory strategy, and facilitate a meeting with the FDA. We will work with Larta Inc. to
develop our commercialization strategy for a Phase II submission. YoungHeartValve, LLC was co-founded in
early 2020 by Dr. Dasi (Chief Technology Officer), an expert in heart valve engineering and cardiovascular
biomechanics, and Dr. James (Chief Operating Officer), who is an established polymer materials scientist, and
the inventor of HA-polyethylene materials. Mr. Todd Tomba, joined YoungHeartValve mid 2020 as CEO and
President. He brings over three decades of medical device industry, and specifically heart valve replacement
commercialization experience, to the team.Project Narrative:
The objective of this project is to develop an advanced polymeric aortic valve that can be
implanted using a catheter, avoiding the risks associated with open heart surgery and
cardiopulmonary bypass. The plastic leaflets are precisely shaped for excellent blood flow, and
engineered to maximize blood compatibility using a natural biomolecule, hyaluronan, which is
present in all body tissues. Proving the long-term durability and performance of these novel
heart valve implants exceed commercial gold standards will speed translation of the technology
to the clinic, and lead to a dramatic improvement in heart valve technology."

This feedback is fundamental to derive learning patterns, identify at-risk learners, assess knowledge mastery, and inform both students and teachers about what was learned, what needs to be learned, and where and how mistakes were made. It informs the teacher what the students know and don?t know. The wealth of data collected by the proposed prototype will promote peer standards of excellence and student self-regulated learning, inform teaching practice, revise curricula, and inform educational administrators. This project is responding to a need in the educational system for personalized learning experiences for every learner, evidence-centered learning, and data that will improve teaching efficiency and effectiveness. The diagnostic assessment of the product will help educators understand the extent to which learners have mastered critical Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics skills to identify specific areas in which improvement is needed and in which areas learners have mastered. The broader/commercial impact of this proposal is the real-time student feedback and the subsequent analysis of that data to efficiently transform Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education. It provides a formative, low cost technology product that can help teachers personalize and revise curriculum in real-time and promote step-by-step problem solving skills required for 21st century careers. This will help the U.S compete effectively in the global market. The in-depth learner database informs school administrators and education policymakers on changes required to improve student performances and teaching practice, and compliance with recently adopted common core state standards. Data mining across multiple levels - from single problem to school to district to state and internationally - allows school administrators to compare performances within the U.S. and abroad.

This technology is already used in clinical studies on sun behavior across a variety of populations (children, adults, melanoma survivors, people suffering from lupus) and can significantly improve the quality of life for patients with disorders requiring particularly sensitive UV detectors to prevent exposure to potentially carcinogenic levels of sun. This proposed project will positively impact broader health with a device that can be incorporated in personal electronic wearable devices. The proposed project will support the advanced development of low-cost UV measurement. Sunlight is a complex electromagnetic source generating spectra that vary strongly with the position of the sun, location on earth, weather conditions from the ground to the stratosphere, and local shadows. Previous detectors were based on simple linear, single wavelength calibrations inappropriate for a signal with a varying spectral shape. The proposed project will extend the development of a new system with a detection limit of 0.005 UVI (UV Index, the health-relevant measure of intensity), compared with the state of practice of 0.1 UVI; this extends traditional detection limits by integrating machine learning. The Phase II research objectives are to engineer a prototype system, reduce the package size, extend the machine learning capabilities, and optimize system performance in real-world environments.

In the United States, skin cancer has become a major public health issue with an estimated 3.5M people being treated each year for a cost of over $8B. The rate of Vitamin D deficiency in the US has been estimated to be over 40% leading to increased risk for depression, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Up until now, accurate measurement of ultraviolet exposure remains confined to research laboratories. This project aims at carrying a scientific breakthrough in UV dosimetry and bring a laboratory-grade technology to consumers. The proposed project aims to achieve a scientific breakthrough in UV dosimetry by combining several detectors, machine learning algorithms, and customized calibration. We anticipate that this breakthrough will lead to a drastic improvement in accuracy to closer match that of laboratory-grade equipment, while keeping the size and cost of our instrument in line with consumers? expectations. The scientific challenge is to have the UV sensor be accurate when it measures most solar spectra, and there is an infinity of these based on location, weather, and time of the year. Our strategy is to stay away from incremental improvements (e.g. filter optimization) or expensive developments (e.g. a full-blown spectrometer). Instead, we are testing the hypothesis that the combination of machine learning algorithms and a small set of carefully chosen detectors will enable us to build a small low-cost instrument able to identify the local solar spectrum and provide correctly calibrated real-time measurements. To achieve this, we propose to apply clustering techniques to find representative spectra of solar UV and train several detectors to recognize them and correct the measurement. The execution of this project requires top-level R&D among diverse collaborators, whom we have gathered for this project."

deployed, micro total analysis system for the in situ measurement of nutrients in environmental waters.
The system will use a microfluidic liquid handling network to yield a device that is small, light-weight,
easy to deploy, and cost efficient to own and maintain. The proposed Phase I feasibility work involves
the assembly of a first-generation prototype using available components and creation of a suitable
interface and subsequent testing for an extended period of time to evaluate analytical figures of merit
and the effects of biofouling. The Phase I study will be limited in scope and will only focus on
phosphate (orthophosphate) detection using standard colorimetric methods. Our goal is to use these
results to expand the scope of work in the second phase to include detection capabilities for other
nutrients and to overcome or minimize any biofouling effects. Eventually we want to produce an
instrument that can near-simultaneously analyze ammonium, nitrate/nitrite, phosphate, and silica. In
the Phase I study the early prototype unit will be designed for deployment in a protective enclosure
near a body of environmental water. In later phases, the unit will be developed for submersible

The Glycan Array has proven a valuable tool in the study of glycans. Comparatively the Glycan Array gives the
greatest view of glycan binding specificity for the lowest cost in terms of analytical turn-around time and financial
cost. The Glycan Array is far from well optimized in our mind. There are three key limitations to an array-based
approach with high throughput glycan-protein interaction profiling: 1) glycan arrays suffer from a systematic lack
of sensitivity, 2) current array providers lack comprehensive glycan libraries with scalable synthetic routes, and
3) physiological glycan binding is intricate and complex and requires a lengthy analysis process. In Phase I we
sought out to find solutions for each of these limitations. First, we developed a first of its kind Glycan Array that
can analyze glycan binding avidity not just affinity. Second, we partnered with an elite group of chemists to
produce a glycan library containing ~900 glycan structures, which is larger than that of the CFG and one of the
largest ever. Third, we partnered with a group of data scientists and bioinformaticians to create a robust software
package that automates the entire array data analysis process. Over the last three years we have formed
valuable relationships with researchers and clinicians in research institutes, pharmaceutical companies and
public health sectors. Z Biotech is perfectly positioned to facilitate the supply for increasing demand for
biomedically relevant glycan arrays.
In each of these endeavors Z Biotech sincerely thanks to the support of this SBIR grant. Now in Phase II we are
seeking funds to continue to find solutions for these key limitations in Glycan Array. First, we will continue to
invest heavily in Randamp;D to ensure that our arrays offer superior insights compared to our competitors. We will also
use funds from Phase II to scale up production to accommodate increasing demand. Second, we will team with
Dr. Lei Liâs group at Georgia State University. Dr. Li is an outstanding glyco-scientist with experience in
production of complex glycans, sugar nucleotides and glycan-related enzymes. With his effort we will maintain
our current glycan library and add ~2,000 new glycan structures in Phase II. Third, we will complete Z Biotechâs
custom software package. In Phase II we will bring this first of its kind glycan array data analysis package or
solution to market.

There is an urgent need of analysis tools for mining glycan array data in order to accurately and statistically study
the interactions between cell-surface glycans and glycan-binding proteins. In this SBIR program we propose to
develop a software and hardware integrated system for analysis and interpretation of glycan array data. The
problem with existing glycan array data mining tools is that they give binding information only for simplistic
substructures of glycans and not complex binding determinants, and they lack consistent signal quantification in
an automated way. To solve this problem, Z Biotech, LLC (a glycan array provider) is teaming with Dr. Brian
Haabâs lab at the Van Andel Institute (a software provider) to develop and improve a robust glycan-array data
mining tool (MotifFinder) and a glycan-array image analysis program (SignalFinder). Z Biotech has invented a
robust glycan array platform having the advantage to display glycans on solid surfaces in a multivalent form. The
glycan arrays Z Biotech provides have superior performance with the criteria for a high-quality microarray, which
is suitable for generation of glycan array data for evaluation of analysis tools like MotifFinder and SignalFinder.
In addition, the Haab research group has been leading developments in glycan-array analysis tools. They were
the first to publish an algorithm for the analysis of glycan-array data in 2010, and subsequently have contributed
many innovations. In the Phase I project, we developed MotifFinder for fully automating the analysis, including
new approaches for identifying subtle patterns and features in the glycan array data. In addition, we developed
SignalFinder for the automated image analysis of glycan-array images. This software program addresses the
previous bottlenecks and limitations in the array image analysis. It is built on the unique algorithm that has
functioned well for the automated analysis of immunofluorescence and microarray images. The goal for the
Phase II project is to enhance the ability of the two glycan-array mining tools through testing on glycan arrays
with the expanded glycan library. The resultant glycan-array analysis system with hardware and software will
have a broad impact on glycobiology research, glycan-related biomarker characterization, and new drug
development targeting glycans.Project Narrative
The glycan array is a vital tool for studying carbohydrate-protein interactions, biomarker discovery, and
potentially drug screening, but there is a need for analysis tools for the interpretation of glycan array data. The
goal of this SBIR Phase II project is to further develop robust tools for the analysis of glycan array data. The
resulting tools will expedite research to deepen our understanding of how glycans contribute to diseases, such
as cancers and infectious diseases."

Current devices, called intraocular lenses (IOLs), can correct certain vision problems. However, commercially available IOLs do not provide the same restoration of capabilities as other surgeries, such as hip replacements. In particular, current IOLs do not address the problems of presbyopia which is the continual degradation of the ability to change focus from far to near object which eventually results in the need for reading glasses. Devices that attempt to address presbyopia, but fail, represent a $500MM current market. This project has a novel approach to the problem and the opportunity to positively affect the lives of the 3 million people each year that are undergoing cataract surgery. The proposed project will continue to push the bounds of our understanding of the mechanisms of human vision control. Previous work done to measure the forces in the eye used to change vision from near to far objects, will be utilized in the design and testing of an IOL that can truly provide changes in vision like the normal lens of a 30 year old human. Several iterations of design will be tested in a rhesus monkey model to determine the best way to capture the forces in the eye, the optimal design of the shape of the device and materials used, the choice of optic material, and the procedures to insert and activate the IOL. All with the objective to turn currently available forces in the eye into refractive changes in eyesight.

This is made possible by a zonular capture haptic (ZCH) apparatus. This apparatus lends itself equally well to several possible combinations of optics. Such optics can be rigid, single or double optics, moving axially, or flexible optics that canchange the radius of curvature. Depending on the optic(s) chosen for the system, it is anticipated that a range 3.5-9.0 diopters of accommodation can be obtained. Traditional non accommodative IOL's and all attempted accommodative IOL's attempt to preserve as much of the integrity of the capsular bag as surgically possible and fixate the IOL within this bag. The accommodative models rely on the inherent, presumed elasticity of the capsule to allow alteration in the shape of the IOL that leads to a changein dioptric power. Our method is based on the observation that the capsular bag contracts around the IOL and becomes unyielding within weeks of cataract surgery, as a result of biological changes induced by surgery. The bag becomes a rigid, fibrosed and devitalized disc, encompassing the IOL and restricting its movement. The rigidity of the capsular disc encompassing the IOL prevents accommodation. Our ZCH remedies the capsular disc rigidity and allows for unrestricted freedom of movement and unimpeded force transmission to the ADIOL. We have already shown that our ZCH mimics and parallels the movement of the ciliary body in our preliminary data. Our goals are to show that we can translate this haptic movement into anterior posterior optic movement and thereby produce accommodation. Further, we plan to explore modifying the ZCH to a mechanical locking haptic that would allow all the steps to be completed at one surgical sitting. This Phase I data is fundamental to engineering the haptic-optic system that canproduce the accommodative range required under the restrictions of forces and amplitude of displacement present in the living eye.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are perfecting a zonular capture haptic apparatus, refining the surgical steps for its successful implantation and activation and obtaining precise measurements of the amplitudes of movement exerted by zonules during disaccommodation, in vivo, in an experimental model of accommodation in adult Rhesus monkeys. This will provide the scientific basis for to engineer an effective accommodative-disaccommodative intraocular lens implant in Phase II of research. Such a successful device would represent a surgical cure for both presbyopia and an alternative for non presbyopicrefractive surgery."

Currently, during cataract surgery, an IOL is implanted in the capsular bag that used to contain the cataract. This lens provides focused vision at only one distance. All attempts to develop an effective variable focus (accommodating) IOL have failed, and this project concept overcomes the current limitations with a zonular capture haptic (ZCH) that has individual components. The company has established proof of concept in animal models and shown that a ZCH parallels the movement of the ciliary body that controls focus within the eye. The technical goals of this project are to measure the actual forces exerted by the eye during accommodation using a ZCH dynamometer, and then use these measurements to engineer and perfect our ZCH prototypes. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is addressing the degradation of sight affecting almost every person. By 2020 it is estimated that 30 million Americans will suffer from cataracts and 9.5 million people would have undergone cataract surgery. All human beings are affected by presbyopia (inability to focus up close) if their life span extends past the fourth decade of life. ?Premium? IOLs such as Bausch and Lomb?s Crystalens, Abbott Medical Optics? ReZoom, and Alcon?s ReSTOR only achieve one diopter of accommodation equivalent which is inadequate. Yet about 7% of cataract patients pay about $2,000 out of pocket per eye above their Medicare coverage to receive a Premium IOL. The worldwide market size for Premium IOLs is approximately $500MM. In addition 700,000 patients undergo refractive surgery via Lasik-type procedures each year and pay $2,000-$6,000 per eye with the possibility of later requiring cataract surgery and the certainty of needing reading glasses. If successful, the proposed ZCH would be the sole technology that restores movement to an IOL and as such has the potential of being a successful surgery that corrects cataracts, refractive errors and presbyopia."

The investment in Cyber Security would outweigh the costs of having to spend millions of dollars on recovering from a cyber-attack. Organizations are starting to recognize that the costs are substantial when it is a longer timeframe to detect and contain a data breach. The SBIR innovation will provide a return on investment to organizations who are investing in cyber security technologies due to the reduction of costs of lost data, business and customers. Companies are likely to lose customers due to data breaches which increase the costs of not investing in cyber prevention technologies. Regulated industries such as healthcare and financial services face higher costs of data breaches because of fines and loss of customers and business. The tools would help reduced the need for additional skilled Cyber analysts. Security professional can leverage the tools to automatically access data versus manually gathering data. We propose customer purchase Flower as a Software as a Service On premise or n a Cloud model. Many customers are adopting this economy of scale because of cost savings versus paying for service consulting fees to companies as a one-time engagement. We are flexible to customer who would like to us the consulting service model of engagement. The project will develop Flower for enhanced functionalities such as: (i) tools to analyze massive data for meaningful insight to detect anomalies with the help of cognitive technology to scan data faster; (ii) provide recommendations based on events and patterns in the data and steps for remediation; (iii) automation of analyzing data for Cyber analyst for different data sources (iv) repository to store captured date; (v) Graphic user interface for visualization tool for analysts to capture real time data; (vi) Enable analysts to predict certain outcomes based on patterns and situations, behavior analysis."

In these formations, it is important to understand where the CO2 is going and to assure that the sequestered CO2 is permanently contained. Three-dimensional surface seismic methods could provide valuable information, but the vertical resolution of these methods is typically 50 to 100 feet or greater, making it impossible to see the small-scale reservoir features that may determine the CO2 flow paths. Crosswell seismic is one method that has the requisite vertical resolution, but two wellbores are required to conduct the survey. Single well imaging, which involves placing both a seismic source and a receiver in the same wellbore, has been suggested as a remedy. However, several factors have limited its utility: downhole source strength, self-noise, and imaging geometry. This project will demonstrate the feasibility of deploying a source and receiver in close proximity to determine reservoir size and heterogeneity within a radius of deep investigation around a wellbore. The concept will be evaluated through an actual field test. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee: The direct measurement of the properties of geologic formations would be useful in tracking the progress of CO2 injection in a sequestration program. Additionally, the technology should be useful in reservoir characterization, development, and field revitalization."

In these formations, it is important to understand where the CO2 is going and to assure that the sequestered CO2 is permanently contained. Seismic methods can assist in understanding why the CO2 has flowed into certain formations. Unfortunately, seismic methods are only weakly influenced by fluid properties that are essential in discriminating locations of high CO2 saturation. Electroseismic methods, which depend on injecting an electrical current into the earth and measuring the seismic response using electroseismic conversions, can provide for direct hydrocarbon indication and direct measurement of CO2 saturation. However, surface electroseismic measurements exhibit very weak signals. This project will determine the feasibility of using a crosswell geometry to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the electroseismic conversions. In this configuration, travel paths would be shortened by placing receivers in the very quiet borehole environment. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee: Crosswell seismic/electroseismic measurements would allow CO2 to be characterized as it moves through the thin reservoir intervals that are typical in many reservoirs proposed for sequestration. These measurements also would allow for a much more complete look inside the reservoir to discover bypassed oil, target infill locations, and enhance the geologic and reservoir models used in oil and gas development. The anticipated market for crosswell electroseismic imaging is $100 to $200MM annually."

Subsurface seismic imaging will be required for the proper delineation, completion, and production of these unconventional reservoirs., and powerful borehole sources of seismic energy will be a critical element of the imaging process.  This project will develop a magnetically-coupled source to cost effectively impart high levels of seismic energy into the wellbore. Phase I designed and built a small-scale prototype, which produced a definitive, measurable output. The prototype was then reduced in size and operated in cased wells in the oil sands of Canada. The perforance exceeded that of current industry-standard sources. In Phase II, the source will be scaled-up, implemented, and tested to achieve the most powerful prototype source that can be cost-effectively produced. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The new source is expected to be a critical-path element for the widespread use of subsurface borehole imaging. Specific applications should include: (a) crosswell seismic at 2 km between wells with receivers operated inside production tubing; (b) reverse 3-D VSP in environmentally sensitive areas and rough terrain; (c) high power, cost effective acoustic stimulation; and (d) moving surface seismic below the weathered layer into low-cost horizontal wells."

Ultimately, production from these wells is controlled by the volume of sand that can be hydraulically fractured and put online. Currently, no method is available by which an operator can determine the extent of the sand bodies prior to completion. High-resolution subsurface seismic methods can address this problem: using crosswell seismic, an operator can image the reservoir up to thousands of feet away from the wellbore and grade the sand lenses prior to fracture treatment. This project will develop a magnetically-coupled borehole source that will allow crosswell seismic surveys to be conducted with 5 to 50 times the resolution of surface seismic at distances of a mile or more between the wells. Phase I will test the viability and robustness of a magnetically coupled source and conduct an accurate assessment of the output. In the course of the project, two versions of the magnetically coupled source will be designed, manufactured, assembled, and tested (including field tests). Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: A new magnetically coupled source should allow gas operators access to high resolution sub-surface seismic surveys.

R-LIDAR uses a resonant optomechanical system to generate a beam scan. While resonant optomechanical systems produce high-speed and large field-of-view (FOV) scans from a miniature form factor, the beam scans lack uniformity across the FOV. Poor scan uniformity is typically addressed by clipping the scan periphery to remove the most non-uniform regions. Z-senz proposes to research and develop an RSL to linearize a resonant scan thereby increasing the FOV and duty-cycle of an R-LIDAR sensor. This project builds upon the NIST Phase I SBIR effort that demonstrated a 25% average improvement in linearity from a 90% duty-cycle scan compared to an unmodified resonant beam scan. This project proposes to iterate the RSL design to achieve a 75% average improvement in linearity from a 90% duty-cycle scan and develop this technology for use in an R-LIDAR sensor. While the RSL research improves the performance of the R-LIDAR system, this technology has utility to a large number of high speed imaging and display applications, including: microscopy, endoscopy, ophthalmology, scanning displays, and laser machining."

Placing the wells too close wastes drilling money. Placing the wells too far leaves resources in the ground. Given the fact that a well in unconventional shales may cost $12-20 million, optimizing the well placement of hundreds of wells in a field becomes a very large cost savings and environmental protection technology. Using an optimal number of wells decreases the drilling cost while maximizing production, and decreases the environmental impact of developing the field by using less water, using less sand and chemicals pumped in the well and disturbing less the local communities. The development team at Z-Terra researched and identified in Phase I a new approach to image with super-resolution small scale faults, reflector unconformities, in general any small scattering objects, by using Diffraction Imaging as a complement to the structural images produced by reflection imaging. By identifying the areas with increased natural fracture density, the reservoir engineers can design an optimal well placement program that targets the sweet spots, areas with increased production, and minimizes the total number of wells used for a prospective area. In the Phase I project we developed Diffraction Imaging prototype software designed to image with super-resolution the small scale fractures in shale and carbonate reservoirs. Areas of increased natural fracture density are associated with higher production wells. The Phase I work accomplished the primary goal of examining the feasibility of imaging small scale fractures in shale reservoirs and improving the Diffraction Imaging technology. In the Phase II project we will research and demonstrate the correlation of the areas with high fracture density in reservoirs with increased oil and gas production, and build the commercial software analytics tools that allow the reservoir engineers to integrate the imaging tools with the reservoir optimization and well planning tools. Several new applications of the basic Diffraction Imaging principles also need to be developed, tools for analyzing and visualizing azimuthal variations of the diffraction amplitudes that in turn reveal information about the fracture and stress distribution in a reservoir, better visualization and post-processing of specularity gathers. Commercial Application and Other Benefits High resolution imaging of the small scale fractures in shale reservoirs like Eagle Ford, Bakken, Niobrara, Utica and Woodbine, and the identification of reservoir areas with high natural fracturing (1) reduces the field development cost, (2) improves the production and recovery efficiency by delineating the areas associated with increased oil and gas production in unconventional shale reservoirs, (3) decreases the environmental impact of developing the field by using fewer wells to optimally produce the reservoir, using less water, using less sand and chemicals pumped in the well and disturbing less the local communities, and (4) increases the amount of national oil and gas reserves that can be produced economically."

Today, it is 30 percent and the percentage keeps increasing.  The technology to drill and fracture the shale formations is now exported to the rest of the world, increasing the national oil and gas reserves in many other countries. The thickness of the shale formations is often just a few hundred feet, so new high-resolution technologies are needed to visualize the structure and the natural fracture distribution and orientation in these thin shale layers.  Current research in the field of seismic depth imaging has identified a new approach to image with super-resolution small scale faults, pinch-outs, salt flanks, reflector unconformities, in general any small scattering objects, by using diffraction imaging as a complement to the structural images produced by reflection imaging. By identifying the areas with increased natural fracture density, the reservoir engineers can design an optimal well placement program that targets the sweet spots, areas with increased production, and minimizes the total number of wells used for a prospective area. This Research and Development project will develop a high-resolution imaging technology based on advances in depth migration using Diffraction Imaging designed to enhance the definition and resolution of oil reservoirs, and in particular the imaging of small scale fractures in shale reservoirs.  High resolution imaging of the small scale fractures in shale reservoirs like Eagle Ford, Bakken, Niobrara, Utica and Woodbine, reduces the field development cost and improves the production and recovery efficiency, by imaging and delineating the areas with high fracture field density, associated with increased oil and gas production in unconventional shale reservoirs. It also decreases the environmental impact of developing the field by using fewer wells to optimally produce the reservoir.  This technology does not exist in the industry and is a fundamental revolutionary advance in any seismic processing system that images 3-D prestack data for reservoir characterization of the unconventional oil and gas geological structures. Commercial Application and Other Benefits: High resolution imaging of the small scale fractures in shale reservoirs like Eagle Ford, Bakken, Niobrara, Utica and Woodbine in the US, and Horn River, Monteny and Utica in Canada improves production and recovery efficiency, reduces field development cost and decreases the environmental impact of developing the field by using fewer wells to optimally produce the reservoir.

This in turn lowers the adoption threshold for this HPC technology in small and medium size data processing geophysical companies, by allowing them to solve the same problem that requires many thousands of CPUs, on smaller hardware configurations with tens or a few hundred CPUs. Another enterprise problem we address is the speed up of the cycle of processing seismic data in the 3-D seismic imaging industry. The standard imaging cycle in the industry is 6-8 months for a medium to large depth imaging project (an area of a few hundred to a few thousand square miles). We aim to reduce this cycle to one month, by using faster and more interactive algorithms, better workflows, and more optimized processing software. The objective of this Phase I research is to examine the feasibility of developing an ultra-fast imaging algorithm that allows for very fast imaging iterations (order of minutes for imaging thousands of square kilometers), which combined with very fast migration velocity analysis tools, including wide-azimuth tomography will provide much greater resolution and accuracy than what can be accomplished today with standard imaging technology.  The Phase I effort is an implementation project and feasibility study designed to demonstrate the functionality of the super-efficient depth migration, while the Phase II effort will focus on researching the implementation and testing the proposed technology in a commercial strength production workflow. The end result of this development effort will be enterprise seismic imaging software that enables an order of magnitude more effective imaging of complex geologic structure. Commercial Application and Other Benefits: This advanced technology enables cost effective imaging of complex geologic structures, allows small and medium companies to compete and use technology that previously was available to only a few, very large service companies with tens of thousands of high performance computing clusters.  Such imaging technology allows oil-and-gas companies to create 3-D images of the earth and reduce development costs, decrease the environmental impact of failed drilling projects, increase the amount of hydrocarbons recovered and ultimately increase the amount of national oil reserves."

Nationwide, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather maps indicate that 29 entire states plus portions of 7 more endure freezing temperatures for at least 4 months annually. In this combined area, an estimated 663,000 agricultural producers raise beef cattle, sheep and bison, which represent 43% of the nation's livestock producers. The 2007 USDA Census of Agriculture reports beef production costs increased 30% overall between 2002 and 2007, with feed purchases showing the highest increase, up 45%. The SSTH will help improve ranching economics by cutting costs as well as opening the door to the growing market for higher-priced organic, natural and grass-fed markets. SSTH solves the problem of stock water tank freeze-over without recurring costs of fuel and grid-provided electricity. This enables longer pasture grazing which reduces the need to purchase and transport expensive harvested forages, facilitates better pasture utilization and grazing management, reduces the need for feed-lot utilization, and the time and cost to relocate animals. Pasture-raising livestock year-around also mitigates environmental problems caused by large numbers of animals in a confined space, such as high concentrations of manure that becomes a pollutant, and byproducts such as organic matter, urea, ammonia, nitrous oxide, phosphorus, carbon dioxide, pathogens, antibiotics and hormones that are released directly into the ground and air, degrading ground and surface waters and soil, and posing health hazards to humans and animals. SSTH will provide a sustainable solution to winter time tank freezing. The most common method of de-icing stock tanks is electric tank heaters, but for remote pastures without electricity this is not an option, and the few commercially available solutions have temperature, animal volume, or cost limitations: (1) Solar and wind powered aerators are ineffective below +10 degrees F., (2) Solar and geothermal ""drinkers"" service few animal at a time, per drinking station, (3) Propane-fired heaters have ongoing costs ranging from $1.87 to $3.97 per gallon, and (4) Wind and solar electricity generating equipment adapted for water heating has high up-front cost, in the range of $14,000 to $22,000, plus installation. According to the Wyoming surveys, non-commercial methods commonly employed to keep livestock water open are (1) 38% manually break ice with an ax or steel bar, (2) 26% run water continuously so the ground water melts through the ice layer (often employed with solar and wind-powered pumps), even though this practice wastes water and forms dangerous ice around the tank base, (3) 5% abandon pastures and relocate herds where water can be kept open, often in corrals or feed lots, as well as home-devised remedies that use combinations of insulation, geothermal sources, various methods of agitation and wood fires."

CAWP will be employed in areas where municipal water systems and grid provided electricity to operate water pumps are not available or practical. CAWP will provide a solution for water problems experienced by livestock growers that raise animals in remote pastures, organic/natural livestock producers, off-grid homeowners and recreational landowners, off-grid commercial and government facilities and municipal waste pond operators, wildlife habitat conservators, humanitarian and water relief organizations, and international users with similar requirements and site conditions. Water is a basic requirement for virtually all agricultural, industrial, urban, and recreational activities, as well as the sustained health of the natural environment. In the last 100 years the global population has tripled and the global water demand increased by a factor of six. Worldwide, a billion people do not have access to clean, sanitary water. In the U.S., the agriculture industry is the largest consumer of fresh water resources and includes 856,143 livestock operations that consume more than 1 billion gallons of water per day. During Phase II, a prototype system will be fabricated and tested under controlled, laboratory conditions to verify that operating efficiency meets computer model predictions. A prototype will then be field tested for 12 months to confirm actual performance to laboratory test results. Field trials are expected to show that CAWP features enable 21 key benefits: CAES - (1) water pumping during times of no wind, (2) no batteries required, (3) energy storage method is maintenance free and (4) is not temperature dependent. On-demand water pumping - (5) no need for oversized water tank, (5) eliminates water tank overflow, (7) reduces water evaporation losses, (8) eliminates mud and ice buildup around stock tanks, (9) pond or stream water can be pumped away from riparian areas and (10) eliminates need for water holding tank for domestic use. Wind-powered air compressor powers the system - (11) excess air aerates stock tank to delay wintertime freeze-over, (12) water can be available in remote pastures longer during winter to improve pasture utilization and (13) better pasture utilization reduces cost of feed. Water pump powered by compressed air - (14) pump can pump dry without damage and (15) pumping sludge will not damage the pump. Low cost air hose transfers energy for pumping and energy storage - (16) air compressor tower can be sited in the best wind resource area and (17) air compressor tower can be centrally sited with low-cost air hose used to run multiple wells. 100% wind powered - (18) no recurring fuel costs, (19) sustainable energy, (20) benign impact on the environment and (21) eligible for renewable energy rebates, tax incentives and cost sharing programs."

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to prototype/validate a novel, self-regulating blade for a 3-kW Residential Wind Turbine (RWT). Successful development of this next-generation blade will eliminate major technical/economic drawbacks and reliability issues with current RWT's, and will promote widespread national and international commercial deployment of wind turbines. This project will demonstrate the following: 1) low-cost, durable, impact-resistant, mass-producible (and recyclable) blades; 2) self-regulation in high-winds and load mitigation in turbulence (allowing for reduced blade mass and cost); and 3) a simpler, more-reliable downwind turbine, for which the blades themselves protect the RWT in high winds and the cost and complexity of the tail and furling mechanism are eliminated. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project enables the nation to meet or exceed ambitious industry projections, which state that 3% of U.S. electricity could be supplied by RWT's operated by a significant share of the 15 million households that have suitable land/wind resources. The timing for the breakthroughs being pursued by this project is ideal, as incentives similar to those offered for residential solar installations are being offered for RWTs. By substantially reducing the final market barriers of high cost and low reliability, this project will have a significant market advantage and will produce a next-generation wind-power technology that will allow individual households to make significant contributions to national energy independence and security."

Whereas, aggregate cost for pasture (cropland, private and public lands), calculated at market rental rate, amounted to 36% of total feed cost. This indicates that profitability improvement could be realized by changing from feed-lot based to pasture-based operations. 2007 and 2008 delivered unprecedented increases in energy costs that are passed on to the consumer. Unfortunately, every level of the food-supply chain, up to the consumer, suffers economically. A goal of this research is to allow ranchers to safely pasture grazing stock throughout the year. This could eliminate the practice of moving livestock herds to feed-lots to over-winter in order to provide water and feed, a practice that has been shown to produce environmental consequences. For example, concentrated numbers of cattle in feed-lots are shown to increase methane emissions, accumulate concentrations of unusable manure, making it a pollutant; and byproducts such as organic matter, urea, ammonia, nitrous oxide, phosphorus, carbon dioxide, pathogens, antibiotics, and hormones are released into the ground and air. These byproducts can degrade surface water, ground water, and soil, posing health hazards to humans and animals. A safe, reliable, low-cost, self-sufficient heating system is needed to prevent stock tank freezing. Z4 Energy Systems, LLC will explore a solar water heating approach using a solar collector and heat exchange system. The product vision is a relocatable system that could be clamped on the side of any existing stock tank, and is sized to fit in the bed of a pick-up. Built-on fencing and attachment points for standard corral panels to prevent livestock damage will also be investigated. For the Phase I project, feasibility of a full system design will be assessed through computer modeling and fabrication of a preliminary prototype that will be tested for two wintertime months.

However, to manage the unpredictable energy source and ensure daily water supply, a large stock tank is required which leads to increased evaporation. Continuous winds can cause tank overflow and additional wastage. With increasing concern for diminishing water resources, this is no longer acceptable. This study will determine the feasibility of developing a wind-powered water pumping system that incorporates Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES). The proposed system will use a wind turbine to directly drive an air compressor supplying an air storage tank at the well site. The compressor and air tank will be connected using low-cost air line, allowing the compressor tower to be placed at the optimum wind location, such as a nearby hill. A proprietary method will be investigated to maximize the energy storage in a small footprint, while also allowing
compressor heat to be used to help prevent the stock water from freezing in cold conditions. The stored air will power a compressed air submersible water pump (already commercially available). CAES will provide energy storage to allow water pumping on-demand during times of no wind. Unlike batteries, CAES is tolerant of freezing conditions, will not require regular maintenance or replacement, and does not employ toxic materials. Additional advantages will also be investigated. For example, excess air could aerate the water tank to reduce bio-fouling, stagnation and mosquito larvae."

for morbidity and mortality after exposure. Ricin is naturally produced by the castor bean plant,
Ricinus communis, which is cultivated on industrial levels worldwide. Ricin constitutes up to 5% of the
total dry weight of the castor bean and can be extracted using several simple enrichment steps. Ricin
in semi-purified or purified form is extremely toxic to humans following injection, inhalation, or
ingestion and has been used as an agent of bioterrorism. Ricin was previously weaponized by the
United States, the former Soviet Union, Iraq and likely other countries, has been used in
assassinations and was recently detected in a number of U.S. government facilities. There are
currently no methods of preventing or treating ricin exposure â this represents a major unmet
need for protection of civilians and military forces.The Mapp team, in collaboration with Dr. Nicholas Mantis (Wadsworth Center, Albany, NY)
and Dr. Chad Roy (Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA), has identified a
number of highly potent anti-ricin monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). These mAbs, either in their original
fully murine state, when chimerized with human constant regions, or when fully humanized, have
demonstrated protection of mice when administered prior to and after ricin challenge. Further, one of
these mAbs, humanized PB10 (hPB10), has been shown to protect non-human primates (NHPs) from
aerosol challenge therapeutically â this is the first demonstration of protection of NHPs by a
therapeutic against a lethal aerosol challenge. We have now generated evidence that a mAb cocktail
consisting of one RTA and one RTB mAb may provide improved potency and extend the therapeutic
window. The in vitro and in vivo potency of the mAb cocktails we have tested is superior to any
individual mAb previously described, which is consistent with the combination of mAbs functioning at
different steps in the intoxication process. Anti-RTB mAbs interfere with ricin attachment to target
cells, while anti-RTA mAbs are proposed to block ricin intracellular trafficking.
The Specific Aims to advance a ricin medical countermeasure to the clinic are: 1) Engineer, produce,
and down-select from the panel of RTA/RTB mAbs; 2) Humanize the lead RTA/RTB mAb cocktail and
manufacture to support Aim #3; 3) Determine the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of the lead
RTA/RTB combination in the rhesus macaque aerosol challenge model. These data combined with
the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control (CMC) information will form the basis of a pre-
Investigational New Drug (IND) meeting with the FDA to solicit guidance on continued development of
the product.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Ricin is a category B toxin due to its ease of dissemination and the potential for morbidity and mortality after
exposure. Based partially on analyses of the accessibility of ricin and its ease of dissemination, the U.S.
government has designated ricin a âmaterial threatâ, and it is classified as a Select Agent. There are currently
no vaccines or treatments for ricin exposure. Our long-term goal is to develop a safe and effective drug for the
prevention and treatment of poisoning by ricin."

These diseases are rare genetic conditions each caused by unique deficiencies in the lysosomal enzymes required for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The resulting lysosomal accumulation of GAG fragments leads to severe physical, developmental, and neurological symptoms with dramatic heterogeneity between different patients. Since lysosomal GAG accumulation is the primary cellular event triggered by the lysosomal enzyme deficiency, the measurement of GAGs is an ideal biomarker of the disease. Unfortunately, prior attempts to quantify GAG accumulation have been unsuccessful due to the extremely variable polymer length and sulfation and significant background from non-pathogenic GAGs that are normally present in biological samples. The Sensi- Pro method solves this problem using an innovative approach to quantify the unique GAG structures that arise due to the specific lysosomal defect. Because each MPS disorder is deficient in a distinct lysosomal degradative enzyme, the Sensi-Pro biomarkers are discrete for each MPS disorder and are not found in unaffected people. The Sensi-Pro assay has demonstrated the ability to quickly and accurately differentiate the various MPS disorders in addition to the ability to monitor individual patient responses to the FDA approved therapies. This proposal aims to develop the Sensi-Pro assay further for clinical use for the differential diagnosis and measurement of response to therapy in MPS I, II and VI. This will be accomplished through a series of studies in collaboration with ARUP Laboratories designedto establish the standards for the MPS I, II, and VI biomarkers, multiplex the assay, and validate the assay in a CLIA compliant environment. With the multiplexed assay established, it will be tested for the ability to differentiate between MPS disordersand detect a response to therapy in samples from a clinical trial for MPS I. Upon successful completion, the assay will be commercialized by ARUP Laboratories as a clinical assay for the definitive identification of MPS patients and optimization of treatment protocols.

We will accomplish this by developing a cellular model ofMLD to screen compound libraries in order to identify small molecule screening hits suitable for lead optimization to develop drugs for the treatment of this devastating disease. MLD is a rare genetic condition found in 1 in 40,000 births that is caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal arylsulfatase A (ASA) or saposin B (SAPB) [1, 2]. The lack of ASA activity leads to widespread accumulation of 3-O sulfated glycolipids in the lysosomes of cells. The accumulation of sulfated glycolipids in oligodendrocytesand neurons in the CNS leads to the profound neurological deterioration and ultimately death. In this proposal, we aim to change this situation by developing a model of MLD based on cells from patients with MLD. This assay will enable the high throughput screening of compound libraries in order to identify novel treatments for this destructive disease. To accomplish this, we propose to develop rapid analytical method for the quantitation of the primary 3-O sulfated glycolipid (sulfatide) that accumulates incultured human MLD cells. This assay will be used to screen compound libraries for inhibitors of lysosomal sulfatide storage. Finally, the hits will be prioritized based on their mechanisms, potency, ADME, and PK properties.

The proposed funding will enable important preclinical development activities required to advance these promising compounds as a novel therapy for the GM2 gangliosidoses. GM2 gangliosidosis is a family of genetic diseases including Tay-Sachs, Sandhoff, and the AB variant that are causedby mutations in subunits of the enzyme complex required to degrade gangliosides. Due to the lysosomal enzyme deficiency, gangliosides build up to toxic levels leading to severe neurological decline and death. The ganglioside biosynthetic inhibitors would be expected to alleviate disease severity through a substrate reduction mechanism by selectively restricting the ganglioside flux through the compromised lysosomal degradative system. We will test if these compounds can reduce lysosomal gangliosideaccumulation in fibroblasts from patients with GM2 gangliosidosis. Active scaffolds will then be tested for important physiochemical, pharmacological and medicinal chemistry properties to identify the most promising scaffolds for further development. When completed, these studies will lay the foundation for additional preclinical development of the first therapy for these devastating diseases.

MPS is a family of lysosomal storage diseases caused by mutations in the enzymes that normally degrade glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Because of deficiencies in the mutated enzymes, GAGs build up to toxic levels causing a wide range of symptoms including severe mental retardation, cardiac dysfunction, and early death. Current therapies attempt to compensate for the deficiencies by IV infusion of specific recombinant enzymes, Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT). Patients, especially those only mildly affected, do receive some benefit from ERT, however the benefit is limited primary because of minimal penetration of infused enzymes in tissues with restricted blood flow such as joints (synovial capsule), heart valve (cartilage), and brain (blood brain barrier).  Further, many patients rapidly developblocking antibody responses to ERT, an effect that is most pronounced in those patients that are most severely affected. Our therapeutic approach (Substrate Optimization Therapy, SOT) is novel because it uses the first ever small molecule GAG biosynthesis inhibitors to subtlety shape the fine structural composition of GAGs in patients, enabling the GAGs to be degraded despite the pathogenic enzyme deficiency. The small molecule approach is superior because it can penetrate the relevant tissues including the central nervous system, heart valve, bone, and joints plus it avoids issues of antibody inhibition in those patients most in need of treatment.

MPS is a family of lysosomal storage diseases caused by mutations in the enzymes that normally degrade glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Because of deficiencies in the mutated enzymes, GAGs build up to toxic levels causing a wide range of symptoms including severe mental retardation, cardiac dysfunction, and early death. Current therapies attempt to compensate for the deficiencies by IV infusion of specific recombinant enzymes, Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT). Patients, especially those only mildly affected, do receive some benefit from ERT, however the benefit is limited primary because of minimal penetration of infused enzymes in tissues with restricted blood flow such as joints (synovial capsule), heart valve (cartilage), and brain (blood brain barrier).  Further, many patients rapidly develop blocking antibody responses to ERT, an effect that is most pronounced in those patients that are most severely affected. Substrate Optimization Therapy is novel because it uses the first ever small molecule GAG biosynthesis inhibitors to subtlety shape the fine structural composition of GAGs in patients, enabling the GAGs to be degraded despite the pathogenic enzyme deficiency. The small molecule approach is superior because it can penetrate the relevant tissues including the central nervous system, heart valve, bone, and joints plus it avoids issues of antibody inhibition in those patients most in need of treatment. Also, due to the underlying biology and disease pathogenesis, this approach will treat both MPS I and MPS II with a single therapeutic agent. Through the studies proposed in this application, we will identify the best small molecule SOT agents for a proof of concept efficacy study in the mouse model of MPS II.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance The goal of this proposal is to test the feasibility of a novel therapeutic approach to treating mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II). MPS II is a rare genetic disease that is currently only partially managed through weekly intravenous injections.  Through this grant we aim to identify compounds that are the crucial starting point for the development of the first orally available CNS penetrant therapy for this devastating disease."

These tumor types produce an altered array of gangliosides that contribute to their growth and spread. Genetic and pharmacological experiments have proven that gangliosides are good targets for the treatment of neuroblastoma and melanoma. The current inhibitors of ganglioside biosynthesis have shown efficacy in mouse cancer models; however, these compounds act by inhibiting all glycosphingolipids (GSLs). Gangliosides are only a small subset of GSLs. The broad GSL inhibition mediated by the current inhibitors causes side effects; therefore, a ganglioside specific inhibitor should be superior. Here, we propose to develop a system to identify ganglioside specific inhibitors. These inhibitors should reduce the side effects of non-specific GSL inhibition while maintaining efficacy as anti-cancer agents. The goal of this proposal is to develop a system to discover drugs that block the production of gangliosides.

Many of these challenging problems require the discovery of genes, proteins, and metabolic pathways with new and different chemistries.  Nature is a vast repository of genetic and chemical diversity, and by extracting the genomes of microbial communities (i.e. the metagenome) from environmental samples, it is possible to identify genes for these biotechnology applications. However, gene identification currently requires both large sequencing efforts and massive screens of recombinant bacterial cells using slow and labor-intensive plate based assays. This platform technology uses an innovative microfluidic cell-sorting technology that will revolutionize the process of gene annotation for synthetic biology. This device physically implements simple yet powerful computer search algorithms as fluidic circuits in a microfluidic chip, and has the potential to screen a single strain out of billions based on the activity of secreted enzymes. This will enable us to rapidly search libraries of millions of E. coli expressing diverse metagenomic DNA for useful secreted enzymes and other gene products. During Phase I we demonstrated proof of concept of the device by using our prototype device to sort a single luciferase secreting yeast cell out of a heterogenous population that was not producing the enzyme. During the grant period we built and tested the prototype microfluidic device, engineered luciferase secreting yeast and e coli strains and used them to demonstrate the power of the microfluidic device. Lastly we created an E. coli library expressing diverse metagenomic DNA from sites likely to contain bacteria that produce enzymes with lignocellulose degrading capabilities. As part of our initial proof of concept for our device, we are using our device to discover metagenomic genes for enzymes that degrade cellulose, and more specifically lignocellulose. These enzymes are essential for cellulosic ethanol biofuel productionefficient lignocellulose catalysis is currently the bottleneck in development of this technology.  We created metagenomic libraries created from soil samples and use our device to identify variants producing enzymes for these two applications. During the Phase II grant, we have three aims: (i) develop our core sorting technology, (ii) use it to identify microbial genes for enzymes catalyzing lignocellulose breakdown for use in cellulosic biofuel production, and (iii) develop the technology as a standalone system. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Our product and our service will both address the need for research and development of enzymes with novel functions for the $3 billion enzyme market. We will meet this growing need by disrupting the current paradigm of one colony at a time plate-based assays; accelerating the pace of scientific discovery."

However, the ability to engineer organisms is contingent on being able to both understand and take advantage of these functions of interest. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing have dramatically increased the speed of progress in these areas. However, the task of connecting this genomic scale information with catabolic functions is progressing relatively slowly. Annotating genes by quickly connecting large-scale functions of interest to their genetic circuits and catabolic pathways is a difficult task that requires new tools that do not currently exist. We propose a high-throughput, microfluidic platform technology to identify genes and metabolic networks involved in producing enzymes with specific activity. This technology operates with a three-tiered approach. First a metagenomics library of genetic elements from soil microbiota is created and transferred into an Escherichia coli host. Cells that affect selected enzyme substrates are identified and isolated within the microfluidic chip. Finally, the expression vector of the selected cells will be sequenced. This raw data can then be subjected to bioinformatic analysis to trace the genetic elements back to their microbial origin and annotate them with the detected enzymatic activity. In summary, the concept this technology is to take a enzyme substrate and rapidly find metagenomic sequences involved in its conversion. In contrast with a horizontal approach where the function of all genetic elements of a single organism would be annotated, this is a vertical approach to the identification and annotation of all enzymes coding genetic elements in the library comprising numerous species acting on a specific substrate. Our method allows us to quickly sample the enormous functional reservoir of novel genes from a metagenome for applications in bioenergy, biosequestration, bioremediation and beyond."

The two chemistries dominating the majority of electrification markets are lithium-ion and lead-acid. However, both of these chemistries have drawbacks, which include the low cycle life and energy associated with lead-acid batteries, and the high price and safety risks associated with lithium-ion batteries. These drawbacks open the door for the ReHAB battery chemistry to become a drop-in replacement to the lead-acid and lithium-ion markets such as stationary, heavy trucking, data center backup, and industrial motive. The primary goal of the ReHAB battery will be to step into these established markets as a lower cost and safer replacement to current technologies. These target markets total more than $50 billion in annual sales and continue to grow. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the ReHAB battery by utilizing freeze tape cast (FTC) zinc electrodes. The ReHAB is an emerging, high efficiency rechargeable battery technology that utilizes the high specific energy density of lithium intercalation electrodes with affordable, nontoxic zinc electrodes. The electrolyte is water-based and is more conductive than non-aqueous electrolytes, which makes ReHAB cells a safe, alternative battery for high rate applications. Despite the enormous potential of the ReHAB technology, poor performance of commercially available zinc foil electrodes and difficulties with fabricating zinc plated electrodes have prevented practical implementation of the ReHAB battery. The Phase 1 project will be comprised of three major tasks to advance the emerging technology and establish the novel FTC anode, including initial characterization of the FTC zinc electrode, fabrication of ReHAB pouch cells with the FTC electrode, and the initial performance of the chemistry under varying operating conditions. The FTC novel electrode is anticipated to provide directionally aligned active metallic struts that will allow for ordered zinc plating, help control shape change, and dramatically reduce dendrite formation due to a more homogeneously distributed current, which will provide much longer cycle life.

Domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing is struggling to meet demands. It is therefore
imperative to develop tools to rapidly increase the productivity of existing production plants.
Manufacturing of pharmaceuticals currently relies almost entirely on batch-based chemical
synthesis. In this approach, chemical synthesis takes place in several separate steps within
large reactors. Synthesis in continuous flow (with chemicals flowing continuously during the
reaction process) is emerging as a more efficient alternative. However, synthesis in continuous
flow is not being widely adopted due to several practical reasons, including the need for major
investments to overhaul existing production plants.
Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) represents the most frequent post-reaction step in pharmaceutical
syntheses. Importantly, while technologies currently used for LLE in the context of batch
synthesis are a bottleneck that dramatically reduces process efficiency, LLE extraction in
continuous flow is highly efficient. Existing technologies for LLE in flow cannot currently be used
in batch-based manufacturing plants because their maximum flow rate is too low to meet the
demands of batch-based production plants.
Here, we propose to develop a novel, high capacity system to implement LLE in continuous flow
in the context of batch-based pharmaceutical synthesis. We envision a plug and play, portable,
high flow rate, self-tuning device deployable in existing pharmaceutical production plants without
the need to overhaul production processes. To build this system, in the Phase I of this SBIR, we
will address the key technological innovations needed to build a self-standing, high capacity
continuous LLE system compatible with large-scale batch-based pharmaceutical production.
Namely, we will: 1) develop a continuous flow liquid-liquid extraction system able to handle high
(turbulent) flow rates and 2) we will develop a self-tunable pressure control system able to
support the operation of such a device with minimal external control. In the Phase II of this
SBIR, we will take advantage of these technological innovations to create a user-friendly
product ready for deployment within existing pharmaceutical production plants.
If successful, this project will produce a tool able to immediately increase the productivity of
existing pharmaceutical plants from 2 to 5-fold. This product will redefine the landscape of
pharmaceutical production in the United States and beyond.Project Narrative

However, predicting fracture properties (density, aperture, permeability, etc.) is difficult, especially in areas where there are few existing wells. There are three general approaches for characterizing naturally fractured reservoirs: Geological, Geophysical and Petrophysical. Individually, these methods fail to provide universal fracture predictions with high levels of confidence in areas where there are few well calibrations. This Phase I project aims to prove its concept of combining all three natural fracture characterization approaches using ML techniques to create a workflow that accurately predicts fractured reservoirs before wells are drilled. The subsurface EDX dataset will be used as training data for the machine learning model. Seismic data will be used to generate seismic attributes; horizon and fault interpretations will be used to generate structural restorations, strain calculations, and other structural attributes; petrophysical information from wells, outcrop analogs, and seismic inversions will be used as petrophysical attributes. Combined, these attributes will constitute the feature data. The machine learning model will be trained on these feature data using label data from wells. There is an urgent need to bring on additional sources of carbon-free energy sources if the United States is going to meet its carbon reduction targets. Predicting these fractures is the primary subsurface technical challenge needed to discover more geothermal resources that then can be developed into power plants. Unlocking fractured carbon storage and geothermal resources will also create more green energy jobs, particularly for geoscientists and the recently displaced oil and gas workforce. Specific groups in the carbon storage sector that can benefit from such a predictive tool include those looking at developing deep saline, oil and gas, or geothermal reservoirs for carbon storage sites. These include the oil and gas majors (e.g., ExxonMobil, Chevron and Shell), all of whom are currently partnered on developing one of the largest carbon capture and storage sites in the world."

This Phase I application aims to determine the feasibility of using lipid enhanced nanosensor LENS arrays for
smart phone based detection of lead Pband mercury Hgin drinking water at concentrations above FDA
allowable levels LENS arrays are composed of fluid lipid multilayer diffraction gratings on surfaces The fluid
nature of these arrays has two advantages reagents can be included within the grating volume and
changes in the grating nanostructure upon analyte binding results in an optical readout signal Three aims
must be achieved before proceeding with a Phase II project First the sensors must be adapted for selective
detection of lead and mercury in a laboratory setting This will be done by functionalizing the sensor elements
with nucleotide sequences known to bind lead and mercury ions The sensitivity and selectivity of the
individual sensor elements will be determined These elements will then be integrated into arrays composed of
different lipid formulations using nanointaglio printing and selectivity for the analytes at concentrations above
FDA allowable levels will be obtained by using an optical nose approach In order to achieve portability and
affordability a smart phone attachment will be developed that makes use of the light source camera for
detection The attachment will require a sample volume of one drop i e less thanmicroliters  Finally the
LENS arrays will be tested on real world water samples spiked with the ions of interest Our ultimate goal is to
produce an affordable general purpose smart phone attachment and specific cartridges for detection of
analytes of interest to the consumer Successful achievement of the aims of this proposal will demonstrate the
technical feasibility of using LENS arrays for detection of lead and mercury in drinking water As the LENS
array technology is potentially scalable there is potential for multiplexed detection of thousands of analytes
from a single drop PROJECT NARRATIVE

At some DoD-owned sites (and those known as formerly used defense sites (FUDS)), it has been determined that subsurface contaminants exist. At many of the sites, trichloroethylene is a subsurface soil and/or groundwater constituent. Under aerobic conditions, TCE does not readily degrade and can persist as TCE with its only movement governed by physical hydrologic processes. Under anaerobic conditions, TCE is sequentially reduced primarily through microbial reductive dechlorination. For TCE, this involves the sequential reduction of TCE to DCE (primarily cis-1,2 Dichloroethene, but trans-1,2 Dichloroethene and 1,1-Dichloroethene have also been observed), followed by conversion of DCE to Vinyl Chloride (VC) and finally VC to ethene. As chlorinated solvents biodegrade, the products of the degradation process may or may not be less harmful than the original contaminants. This can lead to an accumulation of these toxic compounds under certain conditions. Investigative experience, sound data collection and a combination of traditional (physical, chemical and biological) information along with isotope composition or âfingerprintingâ information are necessary for developing a thorough understanding of the nature and extent of TCE contamination in the subsurface."

Advancement in the U.S. economy has been consistently driven by technological progress and innovation. Yet, K-12 education sees little technological change, even as U.S. students increasingly lag behind other nations. The advent of mobile devices and digital learning tools/apps create promising opportunities for developing new learning technologies to deliver academic content that is more engaging, adaptive, relevant and rigorous. However, the effectiveness of digital learning technologies such as game/app based learning is rarely known. Coupling real-time evaluation and assessment systems with trusted reporting, the proposed innovation will help schools make informed learning technology decisions, provide actionable insight to help teachers monitor students' progress over time, thereby improving teachers' instruction and student learning. This will also drive the development of quality STEM apps that leverage the best of today?s technology and reduce entry barriers for innovators. This project aims to spearhead an innovation that can unleash the potential of game/app based learning, creating a marketplace where the best learning apps/technologies are recognized and continuously improved. This project aims to provide new insights and contribute to scientific knowledge about the developmental impact that the interaction with multiple educational apps has on students? learning. The originality of the solution lies in cross-app data mining and reporting. It provides (i) a one-stop dashboard to parents, teachers and students with a unified assessment, (ii) the opportunity for timely intervention and personalized recommendation to each student, and (iii) a cross-examination of a child?s gameplay through multiple apps which has the potential for more accurate assessment. The goals of the proposed R&D are: 1) to build an assessment engine that any STEM based educational app developer can use to provide game/app based assessment at the point of learning and 2) test this assessment engine in a real life setting using 3rd party educational app(s). To reach these goals - (i) a couple of 3rd party apps will be instrumented with our SDK for data collection, (ii) a pilot study will be conducted with 3rd & 4th Graders playing these educational apps on tablets in a classroom setting and (iii) the data will be analyzed with our assessment engine to test the feasibility of this new technology."

 including the requirement of a long time to reach peak effect and that it
 cannot be used to treat breakthrough pain (short-lasting episodes of increased

 delivery (CHADD) technology has demonstrated an ability to significantly enhance the
 dermal absorption of fentanyl from commercially available fentanyl skin
 patches. The aim of the proposed research is to develop a CHADD system that can
 significantly shorten the time it takes a fentanyl skin patch to reach peak
 effect and to prove the concept that CHADD can be utilized to produce a rapid
 bolus of fentanyl from skin patches, sufficient to treat breakthrough pain.

and as a prophylactic for high risk individuals. In addition, treatment with plasma or neutralizing antibody
preparations from convalescent patients could be the only treatment for emerging infectious diseases, for
which no other treatments may be available. At the same time, CP transfusion exposes the recipient to the risk
of transfusion transmitted diseases (TTD), a risk which is additionally exacerbated by the compromised
immune conditions of the critically ill patients. The limited number of current TTD blood tests does not provide
for full protection, restrict the critically limited donorâs pool and may not be available in some areas. Pathogen
Inactivation can provide the solution. Unfortunately, the currently utilized treatments for pathogen reduction in
plasma (solvent-detergent, pasteurization of dry heat, UV or gamma irradiations) are non-selective and can
compromise the quality of plasmaâs neutralizing antibodies or other protective protein factors. We at ZATA
Pharmaceuticals have developed a new class of pathogen inactivators (ZPI) based on the natural polyamines
scaffold, which are truly selective in inactivating pathogens genomic molecules while sparing plasma proteins.
Our preliminary results show that ZPI have high reactivity toward nucleic acids and do not modify model
proteins (Cyt-C, RSV fusion protein) and animal sera growth factors. Using them, we inactivated different types
of pathogens (G+ and G- bacteria, mycoplasma, fungi, protozoa) and high titer preparations of enveloped or
non-enveloped viruses. Currently we are developing ZPI for pathogens reduction in transfusion red blood cells,
research funded by NIH SBIR grant (R44 HL145783). In this application we propose to adapt the new
pathogen inactivation process for treatment of convalescent plasma (CP) by: (1) using 6 virus species in
human plasma to select the optimal ZPI and conditions for pathogen inactivation in human plasma; (2) using
already developed analytical methods to establish conditions for complete neutralization and/or removal of the
residual inactivator from the treated plasma; (3) using specific antibodies against 4 virus species to
demonstrate by ELISA that the virus inactivation treatment has no effect on the binding of the antibodies to
their targets; (4) using neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S protein to demonstrate preservation of
the virus neutralizing properties of the antibodies after plasma treatment; (5) using repeated autologous
infusion of treated plasma to establish its in vivo the safety in the rabbit models.After accomplishment of those initial goals we will apply for funding, including SBIR funding to complete, in
collaboration with New York Blood Center, its pre-clinical evaluation and to initiate phase I human trials, or
alternatively, will license the treatment procedure for completion of its development and marketing. Ultimately,
this proposal will lead to a safe and high quality convalescent human plasma for treatment or prophylactics of
COVID19 or other deadly diseases for which no other effective treatment is currently available.NarrativePresently, convalescent plasma transfusion is being developed as a therapy for COVID-19 patients and as
a prophylactic for high risk persons. Convalescent plasma transfusion exposes the recipient to the risk of
transfusion transmitted diseases, a risk which is additionally exacerbated by the compromised immune
conditions of the critically ill patients. Proposed pathogen reduction technology enables inactivation of all types
of pathogens in convalescent plasma without compromising its therapeutic properties."

The innovation builds on recent discovery of increased minority-carrier diffusion length and lifetime following brief forward-bias electron injection into p-(Al)GaN in p-n junctions or Schottky barriers. Consistent long-term improvements were observed in the optoelectronic properties, including spectral and temporal photoresponse. Increased diffusion length improves minority-carrier collection and eliminates dead space, where carriers recombine before collection.

Far-infrared lasers based on inter-sub-band transitions of holes in p-type Ge span the broad spectral range of 1-4 THz and are the onlysolid state lasers in that region. They hold promise for molecular spectroscopy, chemical sensing, secure free-space local-area communications in visually obscured environments, and inter-satellite telemetry. At present, p-Ge lasers are limited by lowgain, cryogenic operation, and low duty caused by overheating. Since the laser mechanism requires extremely uniform excitation current throughout the active crystal, gain in traditional melt-grown p-Ge crystals is far from optimum because ofacceptor-concentration inhomogeneity. To overcome this feature, neutron transmutation doping of pure Ge crystals is proposed. The products generated by neutron irradiation decay rapidly into stable isotopes, primarily 71 Ga, which is a usual acceptor forp-Ge lasercrystals. The highly homogeneous thermal neutron flux in nuclear reactors and low neutron-absorption cross section for natural Ge isotopes provide the highest possible uniformity for the resulting acceptor distribution. Small-signal gain will increase upto 10 times, allowing higher operating temperatures, reduced dimensions, and potentially continuous-wave operation.A far-infrared p-Ge laser, with gain enhanced by transmutation doping, has commercial potential for applications in molecular spectroscopy, chemical sensing, secure free-space local-area communications in visually obscured environments, and inter-satellitetelemetry."

Glycosylation is one of the most common PTMs and more powerful tools are needed to study the occurrence and relative levels of glycosylation. In th
is proposal we describe the development of new multicolor fluorescent labeling reagents designed for powerful, differential glycomics analysis. The broad, long-term objectives of this work are to simultaneously monitor global changes in levels of (1) prote
ins, (2) a variety of post-translational modifications, and (3) enzyme activities--in response to biological variables, with greatly improved sensitivity. To accomplish these objectives we are developing (in a cooperative project between Zdye LLC and Monta
na State University) a new family of ultrasensitive, highly water soluble fluorescent dyes called Zdyes for multicolor, differential labeling--that do not shift the isoelectric points of Zdye-labeled proteins and tend to enhance recovery of labeled protein
s. Most PTMs cause shifts in 2D gel spot positions and thus 2D gels provide global pictures of PTM patterns. Our recent work has focused on overcoming past limitations in 2D gel technology and measuring changes in protein levels with biological stimulation
. Specific Aims: (1) We will use ortho hydroxymethyl-substituted arylboronic acids to form covalent boronate esters with 1,2-cis diols or 1,3-diols, which are present on all carbohydrates. The ortho hydroxymethyl substituent enhances the binding constants
with glycopyranoses about one hundred fold. A benzophenone group will be attached to the arylboronic acid and irradiated to trap the reversible boronate complex. The irradiated benzophenone is designed to abstract a hydrogen atom from the carbohydrate back
bone and form a carbon-carbon bond between the carbohydrate and the carbonyl carbon of the benzophenone. Excited benzophenone reacts very poorly with water and if it does not find a C-H to abstract it returns to the ground state to be excited again. Bindin
g and photo-crosslinking will be characterized with a variety of mono and disaccharides. (2) Fluorescent Zdyes will be tethered to the enhanced phenyl boronic acid-benzophenone sugar linker and characterized for crosslinking to a variety of sugars. (3) Gly
coprotein standards will be crosslinked with two different-colored Zdye Enhanced Sugar-linkers (Zdye ES-linkers) and conditions optimized for differential labeling and analysis with 1D and 2D gels. (4) Complex protein mixtures from mammalian cell lines exp
ressing human glycoproteins and rat brain samples will be labeled with different colored Zdye ES-linkers and Zdye protein linkers and analyzed on 2D gels to quantify the relative amounts of glycosylation under different biological conditions. Dr. Edward Dr
atz, PI, is an expert in proteomics, Dr. Paul Grieco, co-PI, is a leader in total organic synthesis, Dr. Mary Cloninger, co-PI, is experienced in carbohydrates and glycoproteins, and Dr. Don Thorne, CEO Zdye LLC has a PhD in pharmacology and expertise in g
lycoprotein research and business development: a highly synergistic team to develop new glycomics tools.Glycoproteins serve crucial roles in cellular communication and mediate many mechanisms in health and disease. For example, carbohydrate post-tr
anslational protein modifications are central to viral and bacterial infection, for metastatic spread of cancer cells, for controlling cellular differentiation, for mounting immune responses, and are involved in modulating transcription factor activity - t
hat control gene expression, in an analogous manner to reversible phosphorylation. Tools to study glycoproteins, however, lag in development at this time and we describe the development of new fluorescence detection technology to determine the relative amo
unts of glycoproteins in samples exposed to different biological variables, which promise significant advantages for biomedical research."

ological states, and to more efficiently target and obtain the variable proteins for detailed mass spectral analysis. The specific aims and research design of the present proposal are to: (1) scale up the synthesis of amino-reactive Zdye and Z2dyes that we
re developed and shown feasible during the current Phase I proposal; (2) prepare and test highly water soluble Zdye saturation labels that react with protein thiols to avoid precipitation of labeled proteins (which is a problem with available thiol saturat
ion labels for 2D gel detection), to facilitate spot picking or targeted electroelution of the proteins of each type in the saturation-labeled spots of interest, and to provide additional differential detection sensitivity, compared to Zdye amino labels (g
t30x total sensitivity increase compared to currently available amino labels for multicolor 2D gel detection); (3) develop and test cleavable thiol-reactive Zdyes that leave small isotopic tags behind after cleavage, which will allow quantitative mass spec
tral analysis of the relative amounts of each protein of interest, even when two or more proteins are present in the gel spots targeted, and demonstrate fluorescence enhanced targeted-SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) to pin-
point proteins for mass spectral analysis-- resulting in more efficient FET-SILAC experiments; (4) develop and test several new Zdyes colors for expanded multi-channel multiplexing, to enable single gel studies of global changes accompanying, for example,
multi-point dose-response curves, multipoint kinetic curves, and simultaneous, global comparisons of several parallel samples; and (5) develop and test new dye chromophore frameworks for the Zdye and the Z2Dye designs that will be substantially easier and
cheaper to produce, provide more affordable products to the end-user, may be feasible to use in 1D gel applications, and will embody the same design concepts proved feasible in the first or second generation Zdyes. This project has strong health-relatednes
s, since a large fraction of proteins and protein posttranslationally modified isoforms are not reliably detectable with current proteomics technology. Protein posttranslational modifications are at the heart of most biological mechanisms, since PTMs contr
ol protein activity, subcellular localization and protein-protein interactions.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cellular mechanisms controlling health and disease depend primarily on proteins and a wide variety of modifications of proteins to regulate cell
ular activities, but current proteomics technology remains inadequate to visualize all the protein forms present and to determine all the forms that change during biological responses. This Phase II STTR proposal builds on the successful foundation of Phas
e I to synthesize and demonstrate a new family of different-colored, highly water soluble fluorescent dyes (Zdyes) that take greatly expanded advantage of the unique ability of multiplexed 2D gels to reveal global changes in the relative amounts of protein
s and modifications of proteins. The greatly improved sensitivity and simultaneous comparison of a larger number of sample conditions, provided by the Zdye technology, will reveal the changes in the patterns of protein species that occur down to the limit
of single protein copies per cell, to more clearly expose the inner workings of biological mechanisms."

Today, the proteins of processed corn are sold either into ruminant feed markets that place little value on amino acid profiles, or into poultry markets where the pigment content, rather than the amino acid profile, is the key factor for diet formulation. This proposal examines a novel concept for reforming the amino acids in corn by using non-gas forming anaerobic bacteria in a fermentation step that co-produces fuels and chemicals. The cell mass produced by the fermentation can be processed into a high protein concentrate suitable for use as an animal feed ingredient. Phase I will show that reforming the native proteins of corn in this manner will result in a more valuable feed co-product slate.

The overall goal of this SBIR project is to develop a miniature, microfarbicated gas
chromatography (micro GC) device for autonomous, specific monitoring of toxic VOC (volatile

into a single chip is the key differentiator of the micro GC. Specific aims of the Phase I study
include prototyping of a novel microGC column, demonstration of on-chip temperature control,
and proof of concept of monolithic integration. The final product will be a plug-and-play micro
GC with capabilities of on-board carrier gas generation, sampling, and calibration.
Many chemical and industrial processes cause emissions of VOCs. Some VOCs are toxic or
even carcinogenic, posing a serious health hazard to workers. As a result, there is an urgent
need for workplace VOC exposure monitoring. Existing methods for assessment of VOC
exposure, however, have major limitations. For example, both colorimetric detection tubes and
photoionization sensors, while simple to deploy, lack specificity. Conventional GC instruments,
although providing high specificity and sensitivity, are bulky and expensive to purchase,
operate, and maintain, typically require offline sampling, and are thus not convenient or cost-
effective for on-site monitoring applications. Currently, there is a critical unmet need for specific
monitoring of VOC exposure in an autonomous and continuous manner. The proposed micro
GC will provide an opportunity to address this requirement.Project Narrative

reproductive tissue remodeling during pregnancy and parturition. In addition to reproductive organs, the relaxin
receptor, RXFP1, is also expressed in the liver, heart, lung, kidney, bone and skin. This broad tissue
localization has led to the recognition that relaxin is a pleiotropic hormone with vasodilatory, antifibrotic, tissue
remodeling, antiapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory properties in animal models. The efficacy of relaxin has been
tested in human clinical trials in diseases ranging from acute and chronic heart failure, to fibrotic diseases of
skin, lung, and liver; however, relaxinandapos;s short half-life and need for continual intravenous infusion have limited
its clinical utility. While the rationale to treat fibrosis and cardiovascular diseases with relaxin remains high,
better RXFP1 agonists must be developed that display longer serum half-lives and measurable
pharmacodynamic readouts, while maintaining a safety profile commensurate with chronic RXFP1 agonist
treatment. We have used Zebra Biologicsandapos; proprietary Protein-in-Protein (PiP) antibody technology to insert a
single-chain relaxin construct into the complementarity-determining region (CDR) of an immunoglobulin G
backbone. This technology has been used previously to engineer proteins and peptides with half-lives of days
vs. minutes for the native molecules. A relaxin-PiP, H2-PiP, has now been engineered with an intrinsic potency
comparable to recombinant relaxin in cellular assays. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of H2-PiP. We hypothesize that this long-acting relaxin-PiP
agonist molecule will be a superior antifibrosis drug candidate compared to relaxin, allowing proof-of-concept
efficacy and safety assessment with less frequent subcutaneous injections, thus obviating the need for
continuous intravenous infusion.We submit a Phase 1 STTR grant application addressing the following Specific Aims (SA):
SA1: Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) analysis of H2-PiP. The goal of SA1 is to determine the
half-life and maximal active serum concentration of H2-PiP, and to correlate blood exposure with known
pharmacodynamic markers of RXFP1 activation in the context of acute CCl4 toxicity. This correlation will allow
us to establish estimates of dose and dose frequency for determining efficacy in models of liver fibrosis.
SA2: Efficacy of H2-PiP in mouse models of hepatic fibrosis. The goal of SA2 is to determine the efficacy
of H2-PiP in two mouse models of chronic liver fibrosis that display key molecular and histopathological
features of human liver fibrosis: 1) CCl4 exposure and 2) high fat diet (HFD) treatment.Successful completion of these studies will set the stage for eventual clinical studies in a range of diseases
where tissue fibrosis and hemodynamic pathologies are manifest.Narrative
Relaxin is a pleiotropic peptide hormone that acts through its GPCR receptor, RXFP1, to
elicit vasodilatory, antifibrotic, tissue remodeling, antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and
angiogenic responses. Several clinical trials have been conducted with human relaxin to
treat fibrosis and heart failure; however, success has been limited due, in part, to the
short half-life of this peptide. The goal of this research proposal is to utilize Zebra
Biologicsandapos; proprietary Protein-in-Protein technology that allows insertion of the relaxin
peptide into an IgG backbone to create a long-acting relaxin agonist that can be tested
for efficacy in rodent models of liver fibrosis, thus establishing a rationale for eventual
clinical testing in human fibrotic diseases where the unmet medical need is high."

The
incidence and severity of DR increase with duration of diabetes and approximately 30 percent will experience
vision-threatening deficits. Work over the past decade has shown that the neural deficits observed in DR occur
early in the natural history of the disease and likely precede vascular pathology, shifting a focus of research
and drug discovery toward restoring function of retinal neurons. The overall goal of this Phase I STTR grant
proposal is to establish proof-of-concept efficacy of a TrkB agonist antibody, ZEB85, in experimental DR and to
provide a path for preclinical development, clinical trials and ultimately commercialization of these novel
therapeutics for the treatment of DR, a critical medical need.In Specific Aim (SA) 1 we will determine Localization and target engagement of TrkB agonist antibodies
delivered to the eye. Upon intravitreal (ivt) delivery of TrkB agonist antibody, ZEB85, we will determine its
localization to TrkB-expressing retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and establish target engagement by measuring
phospho-TrkB, both by immuinohistological methds. We will also determine whether repeated ivt injections of
TrkB agonist antibody induce desensitization of TrkB signaling in the retina. These localization and target
engagement validation studies are critical for interpretation of ZEB85 efficacy studies in a rat model of DR,
planned in SA2.In SA2 we will determine the ability of TrkB agonist antibody ZEB85 to ameliorate the antomical and
functional deficits in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DR. We will assess dose-dependent restoration of
pattern ERG deficits, retinal neuron apoptosis and RGC synaptic markers after 12 weeks of ZEB85 treatment
in rats with DR. These studies will demonstrate dose-dependent efficacy of TrkB agonist antibody treatment for
DR.Successful achievement of these Milestones will provide a foundation to examine ZEB85 distribution and
target engagement in a larger mammalian eye (e.g., rabbit, monkey, human), and assess its pharmacology
and safety in anticipation of IND-enabling studies, eventual clinical trials and commercialization.Long term, we propose that ivt treatment with TrkB agonist antibodies is a novel approach that can
complement current standard-of-care therapy for DR, allowing eventual clinical trials to be run concurrently
with anti-VEGF therapy, with the goal of identifying additive or synergistic efficacy for DR patients.Narrative
Diabetic retinopathy and the resulting vision loss likely occur prior to vascular damage in
humans with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and currently there are no treatments to halt
this neurodegenerative disease. Zebra Biologics, Inc. has developed novel, patented
technology to discover multiple `agonist antibodiesandapos; to the TrkB receptor that mimic the
biological effects of BDNF, a trophic factor critical to function of retinal neurons in the
adult. The ultimate goal of this research program is to test delivery, target engagement
and efficacy of our TrkB agonist antibodies in rodent models of diabetic retinopathy and
to establish a rationale for eventual clinical trials of these molecules in human diabetic
retinopathy, meeting a critical unmet medical need."

A specular coating will also prevent the reflectance phenomenon known as the quot;opposition effectquot;, which causes an observed brightening in the retro-direction from coherent backscater off a rough surface.Existing blackening processes such as carbon nanotubes, copper oxides, carbon-filled KaptonTM, and others, result in rough surfaces that reflect and scatter significant energy.nbsp; Many of these three-dimensional surfaces are easily damaged by abrasion (creating particulate contamination), degrade in humidity during ground storage, degrade in the high radiation environments of space, or in the case of black-KaptonTM, are significantly reflective and relatively heavy.nbsp; In this SBIR, we will demonstrate the feasibility of creating new materials and processes that alleviate these deficiencies.nbsp;In Phase I polyimide membrane materials will be coated with our batch coating process to demonstrate feasibility.nbsp; The batch process utilizes a moving evaporation source and rotating substrate to achieve coating uniformity over a broad area.In Phase II, we will develop a novel, roll-to-roll process to manufacture precision optical coatings in the quantities needed for future starshades and commercial applications.nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;"

The process uses an array of evaporation filaments powered by batteries contained in pressurized vessels placed in the vacuum of space. The vacuum coating process is scalable for large mirrors several meters in diameter, but is applicable to any size mirror. By simultaneously discharging batteries through individual evaporation filaments, a tremendous amount of energy may be released rapidly. By placing iridium (or a multi-layer interference coating) on the mirror initially (coated on earth), followed by a fresh coat of aluminum in space, the broadband response of the telescope could be extended down to 30-nm. Current coating technologies limit the reflectance response to 90-nm because of the absorbing fluoride coating which protects the aluminum from oxidation on earth. The ability to coat optics in space offers a tremendous potential benefit to astronomy because the 30-nm to 90-nm region is rich in spectral lines.
Since molten metals such as aluminum are held onto a hot tungsten filament by surface tension, the proposed evaporation process will work in zero-gravity. A high aluminum evaporation rate has been shown to produce the least scattering and most highly reflecting aluminum coatings, particularly in the vacuum UV spectral region. To achieve future wavefront requirements over a large primary mirror, it is likely that many evaporation sources will be required. By placing the power supply (the battery) very near each evaporation filament, electrical losses are minimized.
In Phase I, we will demonstrate feasibility using prototype battery-powered deposition (BPD) units previously manufactured at ZeCoat Corporation.In Phase II, miniaturized battery-powered unit will be designed and manufactured, and the coating process will be developed and tested in a simulated space environment."

The core of the instrument is a very large (3.2 meter diameter) Wolter I optic, to be assembled from approximately 13,000 individual elements. Each element will, in turn, be created by 'slumping' glass over a precision mandrel, of which there must be in excess of 700. In
addition to the very large size of the mandrels (up to 1.6 meter radius), figure and size tolerances are exceedingly tight, ranging from 2 nanometers (axial figure) to 200 nanometers (radius variation). The combination of size, accuracies, production rate requirements and the number of individual component designs defy standard optical metrology techniques.
While polishing equipment that can meet these tolerances exists, the polishers must be controlled by continuous or near continuous (process intermittent) feedback. In this effort we propose to develop a unique ""point-defined"" metrology instrument that can be incorporated into the polishing machine itself, to control the manufacturing process to the required levels of accuracy. In Phase 1 we will develop conceptual designs for both stand-alone and on-machine instrumentation. In Phase 2 we will develop a stand-alone metrology instrument, and in Phase 3 we will fully incorporate the technology onto a commercial polishing instrument."

Low-spatial frequency errors (figure errors) cause distortion in the system wavefront, resulting in degradation of the point spread function. Mid-spatial frequency errors cause small-angle scattering of light (flare), which reduces image contrast. High-spatial frequency errors scatter light out of the optical beam over larger angles, reducing the energy throughput in an optical system. The Zeeko Precessions polishing is a sub-aperture process that has been developed for the control of form and texture in the production of aspheric and other optical surfaces. The Precessions process is deterministic and provides dramatic reductions in production time due to its high removal rate and repeatability. Similar to other sub-aperture finishing processes, the Precessions process is prone to leave mid-spatial frequency defects on the surface. Zeeko has developed a unicursal random tool path that does not follow a regular pattern and is non-crossing. The goal of this Phase I project is to expand on promising initial results obtained by using the random tool path. The results generated by the research project will be used to demonstrate and improve the performance of the Zeeko polisher for this critical application. We propose a study that employs the polishing methodology used by Zeeko Technologies to determine whether trial procedures using the Zeeko approach can effectively correctively finish an optic without inducing unwanted frequencies onto the surface of the part."

Nevertheless there are some observations (tsunami shadow) and theoretical arguments indicating that even such small oceanic currents can result in measurable variations of the sea surface roughness. During Phase I we propose to conduct research directed to the development of the theory of roughness modulation due to interaction of surface currents with a turbulent wind and verification of theoretical prediction by studying available microwave radar/radiometric satellite data.

The elderly population is rapidly increasing worldwide and those over 60 years old are expected to comprise 20% of the
total population by 2050. These demographic changes will focus healthcare needs on those conditions more prevalent in
the elderly. Chronic wounds, such as venous leg ulcers, pressure ulcers and diabetic ulcers are over-represented in the
elderly population and even now present a significant healthcare burden. These conditions impact approximately 6.5
million patients annually with a cost to the health care system of over $25B. Rarely occurring in the young, the healing of
these chronic wounds is confounded by age-related factors such as reduced blood flow, dermal atrophy, increased
inflammation and reduced growth factor responses. The high recurrence rate and failure to respond to current therapies
indicates the need for improved regenerative therapeutics that can overcome many of the age-associated defects in the
wound healing process. Stem cell therapies represent a compelling means of tissue repair and have demonstrated wound
healing and soft tissue regeneration in animal models. However, the intuitive concept that therapeutic stem cells engraft
and differentiate at sites of tissue damage is not well supported given the low numbers of cells retained over time at
application sites in vivo. This suggests that their mechanisms of action occur through paracrine modalities such as
secretion of bioactive vesicles, including exosomes. Hence, exploiting stem cell-derived exosomes as a biologic-derived
therapy, rather than delivering transient stem cells to treat chronic wounds, is an enticing approach. Secreted extracellular
vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes, are packed with potent pro-repair proteins and RNA cargos that are both cell type-
specific, as well as, differentially produced and secreted according to the cellular environment. Based on our successful
Phase I project, this Phase II program will continue the development and manufacturing of stem cell-derived EVs
specifically produced as a chronic wound therapeutic. We will achieve this goal by the following Aims: 1) Optimize the
production of selectively-modified hASC EVs for chronic wound healing, 2) In vivo testing of EVs in chronic wound
models to establish optimal dosing and route of administration, and 3) Initiate IND enabling studies. This Phase II
research program is designed to identify an optimal manufacturing method of bioactive EVs with in vitro and in vivo
efficacy and potency, minimal toxicity and strong clinical and translational potential for the treatment of age-related
chronic wounds towards a future IND submission. This potential therapeutic has the unique advantage of harnessing the
power of stem cells without the need for utilizing complex cell therapies.Project NarrativeThe elderly are most likely to suffer debilitating and chronic, non-healing wounds. Current therapies are
largely ineffective and do not address the complex age-related alterations in the healing process. We plan to
exploit stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles as a biologic-derived therapy, leveraging the multifaceted
healing properties of stem cells to address this urgent clinical need."

the elderly Chronic wounds such as venous leg ulcers pressure ulcers and diabetic ulcers are over represented in the
elderly population and even now present a significant healthcare burden These conditions impact approximately
million patients annually with a cost to the health care system of over $ B Rarely occurring in the young the healing of
these chronic wounds is confounded by age related factors such as reduced blood flow dermal atrophy increased
inflammation and reduced growth factor responses The high recurrence rate and failure to respond to current therapies
indicates the need for improved regenerative therapeutics that can overcome many of the age associated defects in the
wound healing process Stem cell therapies represent a compelling means of tissue repair and have demonstrated wound
healing and soft tissue regeneration in animal models However the intuitive concept that therapeutic stem cells engraft
and differentiate at sites of tissue damage is not well supported given the low numbers of cells retained over time at
application sites in vivo This suggests that their mechanisms of action occur through paracrine modalities such as
secretion of bioactive vesicles including exosomes Hence exploiting stem cell derived exosomes as a biologic derived
therapy rather than delivering transient stem cells to treat chronic wounds is an enticing approach Secreted extracellular
vesicles EVs  such as exosomes are packed with potent pro repair proteins and RNA cargos that are both cell type
specific as well as differentially produced and secreted according to the cellular environment Based on our compelling
preliminary data this Phase I proof of concept study will demonstrate that critical ex vivo environmental cues can tune
stem cell derived EVs to be pro healing and that pro healing EVs are a valid chronic wound therapeutic We will achieve
these goals by the following Aims manipulate the bioreactor environment to generate differential extracellular vesicle
packaging in vitro testing of EV mediated regenerative activities in fibroblasts keratinocytes and endothelial cells and
  in vivo testing of pro healing EVs in chronic wound healing models This Phase I research program is designed to
provide critical proof of concept data demonstrating manufacturing conditions and wound healing properties of stem cell
derived extracellular vesicles This potential therapeutic has the unique advantage of harnessing the power of stem cells
without the need for utilizing complex cell therapies in vivo Project Narrative
 The elderly are most likely to suffer debilitating and chronic non healing wounds Current therapies are
largely ineffective and do not address the complex age related alterations in the healing process We plan to
exploit stem cell derived extracellular vesicles as a biologic derived therapy leveraging the multifaceted
healing properties of stem cells to address this urgent clinical need"

target in the fight against obesity and its related metabolic diseases Brown adipose tissue differs from white
adipose tissue in its critical ability to burn energy as heat through UCP  driven adaptive
thermogenesis Expression of mitochondrial UCP  uncouples oxidative phosphorylation resulting in
accelerated substrate oxidation but low ATP production The resulting dissipation of energy is associated
with plasma triglyceride clearance a key factor in weight loss The brown adipose depot has long been
known to exist in rodent models as well as in human infants However recent evidence has demonstrated the
existence of active brown adipose tissue in adult humans These findings prompted a resurgence of
research focusing on both the activation of brown adipose tissue and the browning of white adipose
tissue a phenomenon wherein UCP  mediated mitochondrial uncoupling is induced by stimuli Multiple
studies using rodent models have demonstrated that activation of brown fat or induction of browning can
promote beneficial metabolic effects and promising therapeutic targets have been identified However the
therapeutic potential of these targets has not been confirmed due to the lack of a widely available
human brown adipocyte model Therefore there is a pronounced need to validate existing therapeutic
targets in the human system ZenBio will address this need by providing a well characterized human brown
adipocyte cell culture system to the research community and will utilize this tool to screen potential candidates
for stimulation of human brown adipogenesis
 The overarching goal of this project is to generate and characterize an adult human brown adipocyte
cell system Aim  is intended to build on our successful establishment of a human fetal brown adipocyte
system in Phase  and use molecular and functional characterization to generate a widely available adult
human brown adipocyte system This includes establishing conditionally immortalized adult brown
preadipocyte lines for use in cell number intense research and screening The second Aim will
expand the adult system to include donors from a wide range of demographics This Aim will also
establish a database of molecular and functional characterization from this donor set that will be
available to the research community Aim  will establish a robust high content high throughput
screening platform capable of multiplexing molecular and function al assays in a well format This
platform will be able to screen for brown fat modulators and activators as well as validating
therapeutic targets The goal of these three Aims is to characterize and commercialize the adult human
brown adipocyte system from donors of differing BMI age gender and diabetic state and validate their use to
identify novel targets of brown adipocyte differentiation for the treatment of obesity These studies will result
in innovative targets for human brown adipocyte activation a crucial step for anti obesity therapeutics Project Narrative

Hh signaling is now implicated in approximately 20-25% of all cancers. GLI1 is the downstream effector in the Hh signaling pathway, and has emerged as a valid therapeutic target. It has been suggested that due to the complexity of signaling inputs in the Hh pathway, targeting GLI1 may provide a more comprehensive strategy for treating both canonical and noncanonical Hh-pathway dependent cancers. This is especially true in light of the acquired resistance to inhibitors of SMO in patients. Screens utilizing GLI1-dependent transcriptional reporter cell-based assays have yielded inhibitors targeting the Hh pathway downstream of SMO including small molecule and natural product compounds that act by targeting GLI1 through differing mechanisms of action. Targeting at the level of GLI1 with small molecules has been effective in a number of cancer model systems including colon, CLL and breast cancer. However, these compounds have only micromolar potencies in vitro, and a subset (GANT61 and ATO) has shown only modest efficacy in in vivo cancer models. These studies suggest that GLI1 is pharmacologically targetable, and that the use of GLI1 inhibitors is a valid and promising approach for targeting GLI1-dependent cancers. Unfortunately, current GLI1 inhibitors are hampered by low potency and a lack of in vivo efficacy and hence are not viable clinical candidates. There are no GLI1-targeted inhibitors in the clinic. Using a novel high throughput, high content cell-based imaging platform, we will screen a diverse collection of small molecules to identify potent inhibitors of GLI1 (Aim 1). Compounds that show inhibitory activity will be further validated in a focused panel of cell-based assays which will incorporate cells derived from primary human breast tumors. These assays will also examine selectivity of the compounds as well as their effects on motility/invasiveness (Aim 2). Promising compounds discovered in Aims 1 and 2 will be subjected to extensive structure-activity relationship to optimize the novel GLI1 inhibitors (Aim 3).  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A central role for the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway has been established in a vast array of cancer types and it hasbeen implicated in approximately 20-25% of all cancers.

Although there has been significant progress in defining the causative factors and molecular mechanisms involved in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, it remains an overwhelming challenge to identify efficacious therapeutic modalities. Novel approaches and tools to accelerate research and development of additional therapeutics are urgently needed. Although the mechanisms are distinct, in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes there is a loss of pancreatic islet resident ?-cells or??-cell function, resulting in a complete or significant reduction in insulin production. Human islets are currently the most physiologically relevant system for the validation of potential therapies that modulate the metabolic regulation of insulin production and factors that regulate growth, differentiation, and apoptosis of??-cells. Biotech and pharmaceutical companies are in urgentneed of novel approaches and tools to accelerate their drug development programs that require human islets and islet-derived cells. ZenBio has recently launched a human islet program in which we are obtaining human islets from Prodo Labs and are offering islet cell-based assays in low throughput platforms. We have received numerous requests for cell based contract research services utilizing both human and porcine islets and islet-derived cells. In our discussions with these companies it became evident thathigher throughput platforms using human islets were essentially non- existent, yet highly desirable. In this application we propose to establish cGLP-assays through adapting human islets and islet-derived ?-cells to a robust, reproducible and validated high throughput screening platform.

This condition results in loss of muscle function through impaired muscle regeneration, resulting in an increase in falls and injuries, a loss of independence, and a reduced quality of life. These changes produce a large health care burden estimated in the year 2000 to be 18.5 billion in the aged population. Since the morbidity and mortality rates are directly correlated to the mobility of elderly subjects, new medicines that promote muscle regeneration should lower health care costs through less hospitalization and nursing home care. Muscle regeneration is controlled by the satellite cell,an adult muscle stem cell. When muscle is injured, the satellite cell becomes activated to proliferate and subsequently differentiate to terminally committed myoblasts. The overall objective of this application is to establish a human satellite cell-basedsystem that can support: 1) identification of the signaling pathways and agents that control the proliferation of satellite cells, 2) studies of the alterations that underlie muscle wasting, and 3) drug discovery programs on muscle regeneration. In Aim1 using human muscle biopsy material, we will establish a satellite cell assay in a 384-well format that can determine the capacity of the cells to proliferate, maintain their satellite cell phenotype and allow measurement of the effects of different agents on these properties. This platform will establish a robust screening system that can be used in Phase II work to identify agents that modify the cells' capacity to replicate and differentiate. Efforts in Aim 2 will validate the assay by examining a set of agents with known effects on skeletal muscle. The utility of the assay will be demonstrated by screening small libraries of highly annotated compounds. Importantly, this work will be the first step toward identifying novel mechanisms and molecules that promote muscle regeneration. The screening assay will become part of Zen Bio's contract assay service when it is refined by work in Phase II, allowing pharmaceutical, biotech and academic institutions to profile the actions of compounds and biological agents on human satellite cells. Phase II efforts will also help Zen Bio develop an intellectual property portfolio that covers chemical and target-driven information on muscle regeneration.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Muscle wasting is a major problem in theelderly and in a variety of specific diseases (e.g. chronic obstruction pulmonary disease, cancer related cachexia, end stage renal disease). This application describes the generation of a cell-based assay system using the human satellite cell, an adult stem cell that controls skeletal muscle regeneration. This assay will provide a method for determining the controls that regulate human satellite cell proliferation, examine the cause of the poor muscle regeneration seen in various states such as elderly subjects and the disease states mentioned above, and facilitate the identification of new drugs that can reverse the age and disease-related decline in muscle mass and function."

About 8% of the US population is estimated to have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, with the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes increasing with the rise in obesity. Even though the etiology of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes is different, the end stages show a similar reduction or loss of pancreatic insulin secretion. This is caused by destruction of the pancreatic beta cells which produce and secrete insulin in response to serum glucose levels. Current diabetes therapies do not offer the degree of metabolic control needed to prevent the progression of the disease to the serious complications and mortality that occur when glucose control is lost. The potential for excellent, long-term glycemic control offered by a beta-like , insulin producing cell is the rationale for our proposal. This cell would release insulin in a physiologically controlled, glucose-dependent manner, responding minute-to-minute to acute changes in blood glucose levels. In this situation, diabetes would be completely controlled. We have obtained significant preliminary data suggesting that adipose-derived stem cells can be differentiated in culture to beta-like insulin producing cells, and propose to develop applications of these cells for use in cell therapy and drug development. It is our goal to identify and characterize an optimized adult stem cell population from human adipose tissue that has the therapeutic potential for the treatment of diabetes.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current diabetes therapies do not offer the degree of metabolic control needed to prevent the progression of the disease to the serious complications and mortality that occur when glucose control is lost.

Roughly 190,000 women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009, and 40,000 will die. The majority of breast cancers originate in the lobular or ductal cells of the milk-producing glands. In these structures, there are two main cell types: the inner luminal cells surrounded by basal myoepithelium. These cells types are distinct and are the precursors to various forms of breast cancer. As such, it is it is important to study these cell populations independently as well as in co-culture models systems. There are no commercial sources of quality-controlled, matched basal and luminal cells (from individual donors), forcing researchers to isolate and characterize the cells on their own. This process is time-consuming, requires access to human tissue, and introduces variation in the preparation and characterization of the cells. Primary cultured human mammary-derived cells are an ideal model currently used to investigate the genesis and understanding of human breast cancer. Because a consistent commercial source of primary human cultured breast-derived luminal and basal cells is unavailable, Zen-Bio, Inc. will address this need by providing a well characterized system to the research community. Phase I of this project focused on generating an optimized primary human mammary-derived basal/luminal cell system from non-diseased tissue. Isolation and propagation of normal human basal and luminal mammary epithelial cells was achieved. Based on the successful completion of Phase I, we are eager to extend our research in Phase II by focusing on making this cell system commercially available. Additionally, we will expand the cell system to include basal and luminal mammary epithelial cells from breast tumor tissue.

In parallel with the increasing incidence of obesity and insulin resistance, is the occurrence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a chronic hepatic disorder affecting up to 25% of the general population; including a significant portion of pediatric cases. Several intracellular events leading to NAFLD and progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) have been identified. However, the exact molecular mechanisms require further investigation, especially in human systems. Primary human hepatocytes are the most physiologically relevant cell-based model for in vitro hepatic function. However, the availability of primary human hepatocytes for cell-based applications is significantly limited. Additional confounding factors for the use of primary human hepatocytes include poor recovery from cryopreservation, rapid loss of functional characteristics, and a short lifespan in culture. Available hepatoma cell lines do not express many of the proteins necessary for the study of hepatocyte function. Additionally, freshly isolated rodent hepatocytes display similar problems as human hepatocytes in culture, and they do not faithfully recapitulate observations in human hepatocytes. In order to address the market demand for relevant human cell-based models of hepatocyte function, we have developed an alternative model based upon the differentiation of adipose tissue derived adult stem cells (ASC) to hepatocyte-like cells. We have obtained significant preliminary data suggesting that the ASC-derived hepatocytes possess many of the characteristics of primary human hepatocytes and are in the process of developing applications of these cells for use in cell therapy and drug development. As an additional alternative model, we will employ a recently developed hepatocyte-like cell line, HepaRG, which is derived from progenitor cells isolated from a human liver tumor. It is the goal of this proposal to provide proof-of-concept for the use of the ASC-derived hepatocytes and/or HepaRG as a model system(s) for NAFLD.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic hepatic disorder affecting up to 25% of the general population and can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver failure. Current NAFLD models are grossly inadequate due to the limited availability and poor characteristics of human primary hepatocytes in culture. This proposal focuses on the characterization of two alternative human cell-based models for the study of NAFLD in vitro, the development and implementation of which will have a significant and immediate impact on the study of NAFLD in humans."

These cells are specialized epithelial cells that line the peritoneal, pericardial, and pleural cavities and internal organs presenting a barrier to invading organisms and physical damage. Ovarian tumor attachments occur through cancer cells binding to mesothelial cells and migrating into the surrounding tissue and vasculature. Peritoneal dialysis relies on the intact transport function of mesothelial cells to allow transfer of waste products from the underlying vasculature to the dialysis fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Host response to peritoneal infection is mediated by the inflammatory cascade initiated and cytokines release by peritoneal mesothelial cells. Research into the biology of mesothelial cells continues with the goal of developing methods to provide more effective treatments for disease. Currently, there are no commercial sources of these cells in the U.S. which requires researchers to isolate and characterize the cells on their own. This process is time consuming, requires access to human tissue, and introduces variation in the preparation and quality of the cells. Zen-Bio will address this need by providing a well characterized mesothelial cell culture system to the research community. Phase I of this project focused solely on generating an optimized primary human mesothelial cell system. Isolation and propagation optimization was achieved by systematically modifying aspects of existing protocols to enhance viable cell yields while minimizing population doublings. The ultimate goal of this proposed Phase II application is to further the commercial development to produce a fully validated, commercially available human mesothelial cell system. In addition, we will develop a suite of mesothelial cell-based assays that are applicable to several therapeutic areas. Aim I is to analyze the cytokine and gene expression changes during mesothelial cell transdifferentiation (epithelial to mesenchymal transition). Aim II is to establish mesothelial cell contract services at Zen-Bio. These services include analysis of cytokine secretion, gene expression, tumor cell-mesothelial cell interaction, and cytotoxicity.

Roughly 180,000 women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with malignant breast cancer in 2007-some 40,000 will die. The majority of breast cancers originate in the
lobular or ductal cells of the milk-producing glands. In these structures, there are two main cell types: the inner luminal cells surrounded by basal myoepithelium. These cells types are distinct and are the precursors to various forms of breast cancer. As
 such, it is it is important to study these cell populations independently as well as in co-culture models systems. Current methods for culturing human mammary epithelial cells predominantly select for those of a basal phenotype. Thus, there are no commerc
ial sources of quality-controlled, matched basal and luminal cells (from individual donors) in the U.S., forcing researchers to isolate and characterize the cells on their own. This process is time-consuming, requires access to human tissue, and introduces
 variation in the preparation and characterization of the cells. Primary cultured human mammary-derived cells are an ideal model currently used to investigate the genesis and understanding of human breast cancer. Because a consistent commercial source of p
rimary human cultured breast-derived luminal and basal cells is unavailable, Zen-Bio, Inc. will address this need by providing a well characterized system to the research community. Phase I of this project focuses on generating an optimized primary human m
ammary-derived basal/luminal cell system. The Specific Aim is to optimize the isolation and propagation of human mammary epithelial cells followed by characterization of the cellular phenotypes. Optimization of the isolation and propagation will be achieve
d by systematically modifying aspects of existing protocols to enhance viable cell yields while minimizing population doublings. A detailed analysis of cell properties, including longevity in culture, cell specific gene expression, and cytokeratin producti

The National Institutes of Health has responded by establishing a task force
 devoted to accelerating the progress in obesity research. In August of 2004 the task force established a strategic plan for obesity research including research targeted at breaking the link between obesity and its related health disorders. Increased abdom
inal adiposity is correlated with a defect in glucose homeostasis and associated with decreased insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissue. Skeletal muscle is an important site of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and often the site of insulin resistance i
n obesity. The molecular mechanisms of skeletal muscle insulin resistance remain to be uncovered and this gap is the basis of this proposal. We have established a human skeletal muscle cell system that responds to physiologic stimuli in vitro. Additionally
, we have established and validated an adipocyte / myocyte co-culture system to investigate the interplay between these two cell types. Our preliminary studies show that adipocytes have a profound effect on skeletal myocyte metabolic activities. Based on t
he successful completion of Phase I, we are eager to extend our research in Phase II by focusing on making the co-culture system commercially available. We will continue the optimization and characterization of two skeletal muscle cell systems using the fo
llowing aims. Aim 1 will continue the optimization and characterization of isolated human skeletal muscle cells, establish quality control criteria, and validate contract research services using this system. Aim 2 is focused on establishing and validating
the adipocyte/myocyte co-culture system for commercial availability. We will investigate the effects of donor demographics on each cell type in the co-culture, establish quality control criteria, and identify methods for shipping and customer co-culture ma
intenance. Aim 3 is to establish a repository of donor-matched skeletal muscle, subcutaneous, and omental adipose tissue from patients of different demographics. These tissues and derived cells will be made available to researchers in the obesity and diabe
tes research fields. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At the completion of this project, a commercially available, fully validated human skeletal myocyte system, skeletal myocyte / adipocyte co-culture system, and related assay kits will be offered to researchers.

The proposal was written in response to the NIH Director's newly released roadmap that encourages collaboration betwee
n corporate and academic institutions to develop alternative models for conducting research and the suggestion by Dr. Francis Collins, Director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, that academic pursuit of [the] first step in drug development
could be particularly valuable . This STTR Phase I proposal combines the talents of Zen-Bio, Inc., the leading commercial supplier of human adipose tissue-derived cells for pharmaceutical research, with those of an NIH-funded Botanical Research Center at t
he Pennington Biomedical Research Center, an internationally recognized center for studies of diabetes and nutrition, and Rutgers University, an internationally recognized center for the development of botanical extracts. Our overarching hypothesis is that
 botanicals may effect one or more tissue types in the development of metabolic syndrome and extracts that limit the amount of fatty acid release in adipose tissue (lipolysis or TG accumulation) will reduce the amount of ectopic peripheral fat accumulati
on and cardiovascular risk (e.g. niacin). In the Phase I proposal, we hypothesize that high-throughput screening assays using human adipose cell models will: (1) Identify novel lead compounds from an existing botanical library and; (2) Complement existing
assays in the fractionation of extracts from botanicals with known benefits for obese, diabetic, or hypertensive patients. As the commercial partner, Zen-Bio brings an existing portfolio of high-throughput human cell-based assays for lipogenesis, lipolysis
, and adipogenic gene expression profiling. As the academic partner, the Botanical Center at PBRC in collaboration with Rutgers University provides its unique library of botanical extracts and chemical fractionation expertise. In addition, the Botanical Ce
nter has already subfractionated botanical extracts from plants with identified therapeutic effects for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. All of these tools and reagents will be available for the proposed studies. Prior studies validate the ut
ility and efficacy of this approach. The murine 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cell line has been used to screen a combinatorial chemical library for lead compounds promoting or inhibiting adipogenesis (2); however, it is well known that compounds identified in muri
ne models often fail as human pharmacological agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The chemicals identified through this STTR may have potential application in the treatment of obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. The outcome of this work will have dire
ct commercial implications for both Zen-Bio and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in terms of potential products, licensing opportunities, and intellectual property."

In response to the associated reduced life expectancy and expensive health problems the NIH has established an Obesity Research Task Force. The product development proposed in this SBIR application directly addresses the needs outlined in the Task Force's August 2004 Strategic Plan. One of the tenets of the plan is supporting research toward breaking the link between obesity and its related disorders. Increased abdominal adiposity correlates with defects in glucose homeostasis and is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissue. Skeletal muscle is an important site of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and is often the site of insulin resistance in obese individuals. To support research in this area, we propose to develop a well characterized, widely commercially available co-culture system of primary human skeletal myocytes and adipocytes. This cell system will allow researchers to investigate the complex interaction between two cell types directly involved in the etiology of Type 2 diabetes and metabolic disease. Zen-Bio has been providing cultured primary human cells commercially to researchers for the past 10 years and has established the expertise required for the completion of this proposal. The focus of the company has been adipocytes, however, scientists at Zen-Bio have expertise in the isolation, expansion, and differentiation of many types of human primary cells, including myoblasts. Phase I of this proposal consists of two aims. Aim I is expected to establish robust human satellite cell isolation, culturing, and myoblast differentiation protocols.

In fact, only 10-15% of smokers develop this disease, indicating that otherfactors make certain individuals more susceptible to cancer. A number of single nucleotide polymorphisms are known to correlate with the development of lung cancer, but the underlying genes responsible for this association are not always clear. Nor is theimpact of any one of these polymorphisms by themselves known to be highly significant. Indeed, as of yet there are no known genes that have been convincingly associated with lung cancer. Our research has focused on the SWI/SNF complex, which controls and regulates gene expression for a number of proteins and signaling pathways that have anticancer functions. We have found that the inactivation of this complex-particularly via loss of its key catalytic subunit, BRM-promotes cancer development. BRM epigeneticsilencing occurs in 15-20% of most solid tumors. Intriguingly, this gene is epigenetically silenced but never mutated in cell lines or primary tumors. Central to the silencing of BRM are two polymorphisms found in the promoter region. Because these polymorphisms appear to control the silencing of BRM, we surmise their presence is secondarily associated with cancer. This research will use three independent case-control studies (~500 test subjects each) using different geographic populations to directly test whether these polymorphisms are indeed associated with lung cancer. We will genotype lung cancer patients and compare these results with a matched set of subjects who do not have a history of any type of cancer. Samples will be analyzed using an established TaqMan assay to determine genotypes and the specific BRM polymorphisms associated with lung cancer. This research would be a major advance not only because it could identify one of the first genes specifically associated with lung cancer, but also because this gene is epigenetically silenced and not mutated. Thus, it may be possible to reactivate BRM and eliminate this risk factor.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using no more than two or three sentences, describe the relevance of this research to public health. In this section, be succinct and use plain language that can be understood by a general, lay audience confirming that the newly discovered BRM polymorphism correlates with cancer risk would lead to substantial progress in our ability to fight lung cancer. This potential marker will allow us to determine who is at higher risk for developing cancer, as well as allow us in the short term to stratify patients for cancer screening and chemoprevention.

This important fact is supported by a vast amount of literature on pre-clinical models and clinical studies. There is growing demand for technologies to measure tumor hypoxia and angiogenesis temporally and spatially in vivo to enable advances in drug screening, development and optimization. This is particularly useful in the emerging era of anti-angiogenesis and anti-hypoxia therapies. We propose to develop a portable, low power consumption and low-cost, yet accurate and reliable, multimodality optical spectroscopy system with a novel fiber-optic probe to dynamically characterize tumor hypoxia, angiogenesis, and metabolism as well as tissue drug concentration in small animal models without operator bias. The multimodality optical spectroscopy system will be a laptop or battery powered console with the integration of multiple LEDs, a dual-channel spectrometer, a fiber optic probe, electronics and custom software that can be used to perform both diffuse reflectance and fluorescence spectroscopy in vivo. The fiber-optic probe will include an interferometric pressure sensor that can be used to control the probe-tissue pressure for reliable and reproducible spectroscopic measurement of tissue optical properties. The aims of the proposed work (Phase I) will be to (1) design the core technology using LEDs and an interferometric fiber-optic sensor, (2) characterize its performance metrics and (3) validate its utility in a pre-clinical mammary tumor model. This technology will be extended to include quantitative fluorescence measurements in the Phase II STTR project period along with different probe designs to provide flexibility in implementation of this technology to ectopic (tumors grown on flank) and orthotopic models. The commercial device can be marketed as either a single- modality (diffuse reflectance) or a multi-modality (reflectance and fluorescence) device. The outcome of Phase I will lead to a 1st generation Quantilux device which can be productized while the multi-modality 2nd generation device is being refined.The overall objective in Phase II and beyond will be to develop a marketable version of the device and validate its utility for longitudinal tumor therapy monitoring in mouse tumor models. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our long-term goal is to develop and commercialize a compact, low power consumption, low-cost, yet accurate and reliable, optical spectroscopy system, to dynamically and non-destructively quantify tumor physiological and morphological endpoints such as angiogenesis and hypoxia in small animal models. This proposal is significantly relevant to public health because angiogenesis andhypoxia can significantly influence the efficacy of therapy and the behavior of surviving tumor cells."

Approximately 180,000 of these patients undergo breast conserving surgery (BCS), also called lumpectomy. Multiple recent studies show that a staggering 20-70% of the 180,000 patients (45% or ~81,000 women on average) have to return for a repeat surgery due to incomplete removal of the cancer at the first BCS. The long-term objective of this research is the market introduction of a clinically useful, intra-operative device for breast tumor margin assessment. The objective of the proposed research is to develop a clinical-trial-ready device and to evaluate its practical utility as a routinely used intra-operative tool. The specific aims of the proposed work are: (1) to design, fabricate and characterize a multi-channel optical spectral imaging system that will provide two- dimensional measurements from a depth of up to 2 mm within breast tissues in order to detect close and positive tumor margins in freshly excised lumpectomy specimens, (2) to perform a verification study of the device design specifications on tissue phantoms and (3) to perform a critical evaluation of the device in a practical clinical setting. The proposed technology will be a multi-channel optical assay device for intraoperative imaging of margins in specimens excised from patients undergoing breast conserving surgery (partial mastectomy). It is theorized that this optical assay system will help guide the surgeon to either complete the surgery, when margins are negative, or re-excise additional tissue, when margins are positive. The proposed clinical study will serve as an important database for future technological developments related to effective intra-operative assessment of tumor margins in patients with breast cancer. Successful completion of the long-term objectives of this research will result in significant benefits to breast cancer patients (preventing tens of thousands of unnecessary surgeries each year) as well as surgeons, hospitals, and health-care providers. The technology proposed in this research could also potentially be utilized in the assessment of tumor margins in patients with other types of cancers, widening the potential health impact of the research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this STTR proposal is to develop a non-invasive multi-channel optical assay device for intra-operative imaging of tumor margins in tissue specimens excised from patients undergoing breast conserving cancer surgery. The proposed research is significantly relevant to public health due to the potential to contribute to the reduction of tens of thousands of unnecessary breast re-excision surgeries each year, and the corresponding lowered risk of local recurrence in patients with invasive and non-invasive breast malignancies who have their cancer fully removed in the first surgery."

Needing a second surgery means increased cancer recurrence, patient anxiety, complications, and cost. Currently, surgeons have no readily available, cost efficient, intraoperative instruments that ensure that the cancer has been completely excised to prevent re-excision. To improve care, surgeons are seeking real time information on the tumor margins at the site of excision. Prior intraoperative solutions (frozen section and cytology) to prevent re-excision have not been adopted because they required a pathologist in the O.R., take too long during surgery, and only examine less than 1% of the tumor margin. Our long-term objective is to develop a chemically specific and quantitative multi-channel optical assay device for intraoperative assessment of tumor margins in patients undergoing breast conserving surgery (lumpectomy). The optical device will provide non-destructive evaluation of approximately 80% of the tumor margin in the excised specimen (as opposed to 1% provided by touch prep or frozen section); require no specialized personnel or sample processing (cutting and staining); and will require considerably less time than conventional techniques. The goal of the work is to design, fabricate and evaluate a single- channel alpha version of the optical assay device that will provide point measurements, and conduct a pilot clinical study on ex vivo breast tissues to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our novel technology. The specific aims are to: (1) design and optimize a single-channel optical device using Monte Carlo simulations; (2) build an alpha prototype device based on the simulations, and (3) validate the device&#039;s performance against a standard bench- top optical system on synthetic breast tissue phantoms, and determine the sensitivity and specificity on excised human breast tissue specimens in a pilot clinical study. Concurrent with this effort, we are recruiting expertise in management, regulatory and reimbursement strategies so that we will be well positioned to bring this device to market following completion of the R&D program. This device will have significant clinical benefits including: (1) reduced repeat surgeries and hence, reduced local recurrence, (2) reduced tissue removal, which translates to cosmetically-superior lumpectomies at the time of the first surgery, (3) reduced emotional distress, (4) reduced complications due to reduced number of surgeries and shorter recovery times for the patient and (5) reduced cost for the patient and the healthcare system. Successful completion of this project will set the foundation for the development of a fast, multi-pixel optical assay system for intraoperative assessment of tumor margins in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. The optical assay system will have significant clinical benefits including: (1) reduced re-excision rates, (2) reduced tissue removal, which translates to cosmetically-superior lumpectomies at the time of the first surgery, (3) better margin assessment leading to reduced repeat surgeries and hence, reduced local recurrence, (4) reduced emotional distress, and (5) reduced complications due to reduced number of surgeries and shorter recovery times for the patient."

The U.S. is experiencing two human resources gaps in computing. First, by 2020, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts there will be 1.2 million more CS related jobs than Americans trained to fill them. Second, female, African-American and Latino student participation remains stubbornly low. This results in a loss of talent and innovation for America, and lost career opportunities for U.S. students. Research suggests these gaps are the result of too few students being introduced early to rigorous and compelling CS education. Currently, 19% of U.S. high-school students take a CS class, a percentage that has fallen over the last two decades (NAEP High School Transcript Study, 2009). This issue is further exacerbated by a lack of qualified CS teachers. The Phase 1 project prototype will be an easy-to-implement, student-driven mechanism to provide standards-based CS instruction. Unlike current initiatives that narrowly focus on programming, this prototype will align with standards developed by the nation's leading organizations for computing professionals and will allow under-trained instructors to provide comprehensive CS courses to students. The proposed project will provide high school students with an engaging and rigorous introduction to CS, and a clear pathway to college-level study and careers in CS and computing-related fields. The project will be designed according to Universal Design for learning principles (UDL, 2013) to be student-driven and inquiry-based, and to support multiple learning styles. Students will engage with complex computational concepts and algorithmic constructs via interactive, multimedia, and adaptive content. Research suggests that these approaches improve knowledge retention and engagement with the subject (Gordon & Brayshaw, 2008). Unlike existing computing education, this project will make explicit connections to real-world context and societal impact which research suggests improves the engagement of students who might otherwise not connect to computing (Owens et al., 2008; Barker et al, 2014). In Phase I, the essential project infrastructure and architecture, a prototype of the reporting module and 5 of the 10 planned content modules will be developed. System and compatibility testing along with iterative usability and feasibility testing will be conducted. At the end of Phase 1, a pilot study will be conducted with high school students (n=50) and CS teachers (n=5) to assess the usability and the feasibility of the completed prototype and whether the contextualized content increases female and minority students? affiliation and interest in CS. Users will also evaluate the initial feasibility of a Phase 2 full product concept in a classroom setting based on their experience with the prototype."

Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common cause of obstructive lower urinary tract symptoms in
men. As the prostate progressively enlarges with age, it obstructs the flow of urine from the bladder, leading to
urinary straining, frequency, urgency, and nocturia. At Zenflow, we have developed the Spring System, which
consists of a single-wire nickel titanium (nitinol) coil implant designed to permanently relieve BPH-related urinary
obstruction, and a flexible transurethral delivery system that includes a cystoscope with built-in visualization. We
developed this solution to meet the long-standing clinical need for a safe, effective, cost-efficient, office-based
BPH therapy that provides durable symptom relief in a single procedure without side effects. The device aims to
improve upon previous technologies such as stents and the prostatic urethral lift device. Between 2014 and
2017, we developed the first-generation Spring System and successfully completed preclinical work including
cadaver and chronic animal studies, then first-in-man studies. In 2017, we were awarded a Phase II NIH SBIR
grant. This project involved development of a refined design to improve clinical safety, effectiveness, and ease
of use. The goal of this Phase II project was, in conjunction with ongoing pilot clinical trials, to prepare Zenflow
for a US pivotal IDE study. While the aims of this project were successful, clinical testing revealed opportunities
for further improvements to the Spring System, which we believe will result in an even safer and more reliable
procedure that reaches a new frontier in effectiveness, and will also expand the range of anatomical
configurations that the system can treat. These improvements fall into two categories which we offer to test under
the current grant proposal: in Specific Aim 1 we will improve the implant and delivery system to yield a more
effective procedure that can treat a broader range of patients, and in Specific Aim 2 we will improve our
proprietary single-use cystoscope to enable better visualization and allow urologists to place the implant more
accurately and confidently. Next, in Specific Aim 3 we will validate all improvements described above, we will
test the full Spring System in cadavers to demonstrate functionality of the Spring System in simulated use by a
urologist. The system will be tested on two cadavers at the end of year 1 after completing all implant and delivery
system work described in Aim 1, then two more at the end of year 2 after completing all scope developments in
Aim 2. Successful completion of both of these studies will represent completion of our Phase II work. We will
incorporate the results of the Aim 1 implant work into our US pivotal IDE study. The Aim 2 Scope improvements
will be incorporated into later clinical studies. While we developed the Spring Scope specifically to place the
Spring Implant, it could be used for deployment of implants to treat conditions such as urethral strictures or
painful bladder syndrome, delivery of drugs or energy to treat BPH-related LUTS, prostate cancer, or other
conditions. We will continue to explore these possibilities and file intellectual property on alternative applications.NARRATIVE
Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common cause of obstructive lower urinary tract symptoms
(LUTS) in men. In the US, more than 50% of men in their 60s and 90% of octogenarians present with LUTS.
Zenflow has developed the Spring System consists of a single-wire nickel titanium coil implant designed to
permanently relieve BPH-related urinary obstruction, and a flexible transurethral delivery system that includes a
cystoscope with built-in visualization. The aim of this project is to further improve the implant and the delivery

Education in biotech is limited from a practical point of view to schools with the funds to purchase expensive equipment and to train their teachers to use it. Kits including equipment and accompanying instructional materials are available in large biotech markets but require teacher training, purchase of materials and check-out and return of equipment. In this, instruction is limited to a few high schools in key biotech hubs. Our goal is to give every student in the country equal access to biotech training by building a laboratory in their pocket through the proposed product. Through use of mobile devices, a $100 tablet can replace thousands of dollars in laboratory equipment. Everything the student needs to complete their studies will be included in the app or through in-app purchases. Teacher training would be minimal because back-end validation of all reagent kits and accompanying gear is completed to make its use seamless and universally applicable. All accompanying information required for the teacher is provided including in-App assessment tools of student performance. The app may be downloaded by anyone in the country and gear/reagents rapidly shipped directly to the teacher?s classroom. Teachers in rural communities will have the same access as teachers in the wealthiest school districts. The project will focus on developing a web-based app with a back-end database that teaches hands-on biotech laboratory skills and concepts via discovery-based learning. The app includes an exploration lab module that simulates high-end scientific equipment, including a spectrophotometer and microscope that use the smart-phone camera. A second module takes students through various laboratory skills including micropipetting, use of microscope, and spectrophotometer. Students learn background and are led through practice and research activities resulting in a report. A third module uses guided discovery-based learning approaches to take students through the scientific method to a real-world research problem and adheres to all three dimensions of Next Generation Science Standards. Unit includes a study of milk digestion by the pancreas that features isolation of pancreatic proteases, drug discovery/natural product screening and quality control testing of commercially available enzyme supplements. In these explorations, students are not given answers. They must formulate hypothesis and do guided background research and ultimately perform hands-on experiments resulting in a final report. Student progress is captured in a back-end database and monitored by their instructor. Hardware such as micropipettes and attachments for phone/tablet will be designed and prepared through 3D printing.

However, unlike in the antiviral field, most commercial antibiotics were discovered many years ago and little advancement has been made in the discovery of novel therapeutics. This is even after the dawn of the genomics era when complete bacterial genomes were sequenced and unique enzymatic pathways identified. A multitude of targets have been screened by high-throughput screening methods to no avail. Recently, the reason for this high failure rate has been analyzed and conclusions drawn that traditional HTS libraries, designed to fit all disease indications, do not possess the properties required for anti-bacterial agents. Retrospective analysis reveal that in general successful antibacterial agents are more polar and larger than other drug molecules, and in fact, do not fit the criteria used to build most large HTS collections. Rather than re-building HTS libraries for antibacterial research which would be a tremendous and costly undertaking, in this proposal, we will use another method, fragment-based lead discovery, where fragments of drugs are screened rather than intact molecules. Because the compounds are smaller, the libraries need not be large or costly to assemble. Furthermore, as we find compounds that bind to our target and begin to increase the size of the fragments, we can design in antibiotic-friendly chemical properties at the same time we are building in potency. We are focusing on the bacterial cell wall synthesis pathway in gram negative bacteria, targeting two proteins: LpxA and LpxD. Both proteins are essential and because the cell wall can invoke resistance to some antibiotics, inhibitors may not only be therapeutic agents as a mono-therapy but could be co-dosed with existing resistant antibiotics.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacterial resistance to antibiotics has been an evolving problem since the dawn of the antibiotics era, requiring consistent scientific advances over the years in antibiotic discovery, epidemiological surveillance and infection control techniques to overcome the then-current clinical problem. We are addressing resistance mechanisms by finding inhibitors of bacterial cell wall synthesis in gram negative bacteria. We are targeting two proteins in the pathway: LpxA and LpxD using the method of fragment- based lead discovery. Traditional modern drug discovery methods have been largely unsuccessful in identifying antibacterial compounds primarily because we have been looking in the wrong place (in chemical space). Chemical properties of successful antibiotics have been identified and will be adhered to through the course of this study."

It is now proven that ALK has a widespread pathogenic involvement in cancer through the expression of either constitutively activated fusion proteins or activating mutations, making this tyrosine kinase an important target for drug discovery research. Many of the forms of cancer associated with ALK are rare but have no effective forms of treatment available; some of these cancers such as neuroblastoma are primarily pediatric tumors and result in death for nearly all patients with them. Beyond these limited-population diseases, ALK fusions have now recently been associated with a subset of lung cancer, a malignancy that results in 1.18 million deaths per year worldwide. Since ALK is not broadly expressed in normal cells and ALK knockout mice have a normal life span and no discernible functional deficits, ALK inhibitors are expected to provide highly effective anticancer treatments with minimal side effects; this consideration will be of especial importance should a chronic treatment regimen be required for certain pediatric cancers. As an additional benefit, potent and selective ALK inhibitors will serve as important research tool compounds to assist in the characterization of the role of ALK in cancer as well as for further elucidation of the normal functions of ALK. Zenobia Therapeutics has identified low micromolar inhibitors of ALK that are ligand efficient fragments-of-drugs. During Phase I of this proposal, Zenobia will optimize these hits, complete the crystal structure of ALK, which is currently unknown, and identify additional lead series through the method of Fragment-Based Lead Discovery (FBLD). In addition to inhibiting WT-ALK, Zenobia will design compounds to inhibit resistant mutants identified in the laboratory of Dr. Stephen Morris of St. Jude Children&#039;s Research Hospital. At the transition from Phase I to Phase II, two-three lead series will be chosen for additional optimization and the series that best meets the criteria of our target product profile, will progress into advanced lead optimization towards the goal of identifying compounds for pre-clinical, IND enabling studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ALK is a kinase that has been implicated in a number of cancers including a number of pediatric cancers which are fatal and have no treatment. Because the pediatric patient population is relatively low, little work has been completed in identifying a clinical candidate that targets ALK. Recently, ALK mutations have been observed in lung cancer which results in over 1 million deaths per year. This has increased interest in ALK. We will be working with St. Jude Children&#039;s Research Hospital to find ALK inhibitors that may be used for limited population pediatric cancers and for lung cancer."

Project Summary
Most patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer eventually develop resistance to
tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor AI treatment where the recurrent and or progressive disease
retains the expression of ER  The standard treatment of breast cancer progressing after
tamoxifen or AI therapy is fulvestrant which is the only FDA approved selective estrogen
receptor degrader SERD as a second line endocrine regimen Due to its extremely poor oral
bioavailability fulvestrant was administered as a mg month by intramuscular injection
which was approved in  It takes month to reach the steady state serum concentration
of fulvestrant atng mL in patients Subsequent clinical trials usingmg month with an
additional loading dose on daydemonstrated significant clinical improvement leading to the
 FDA approval of fulvestrant as a mg injection regimen However even at this dosage
the peak blood concentration of fulvestrant remains below a modestng mL and the time to
steady state drug concentration remains aboutdays These shortcomings of fulvestrant may
account for the limited clinical efficacy low patient response rate Thus a potent orally
bioavailable SERD has potential for significantly higher receptor knockdown and for more
durable clinical benefits than fulvestrant To date only two nonsteroidal oral SERDs GDC
 Genentech and AZD AstraZeneca are being tested in clinical trials These oral SERDs
have very different molecular structures from fulvestrant are less potent than fulvestrant in
preclinical studies and are at least several years away from being proven clinically safe and
efficacious On the other hand few reports have described attempts to make orally bioavailable
steroidal SERDs and none has progressed to clinical studies Indeed these attempts focused
on modifications made primarily to the long alkyl chain to increase polarity and solubility but
failed to address the main problem that is responsible for the poor bioavailability of fulvestrant
that is fulvestrant undergoes rapid and extensive O glucuronidation and O sulfation to form
polar metabolites that are inactive and water soluble Zenopharm has developed ZB a
patented steroidal oral SERD that can effectively enhance systemic bioavailability while
bypassing first pass metabolism glucuronidation and sulfation of fulvestrant Preclinical studies
confirmed that this chemical modification can retain sufficiently high binding affinity of the
steroidal moiety of fulvestrant while minimizing glucuronidation and sulfation We found that
ZBbinds to ER with high affinity and exerts its antiestrogenic effect on ER expressing breast
cancer cells In both tamoxifen naive and tamoxifen resistant breast cancer cells ZB
potently inhibits cell proliferation and effectively degrades the hormone receptor in a dose
dependent manner Moreover ZBis shown to have far superior oral bioavailability in mice
compared to fulvestrant Therefore ZBis a viable oral SERD which can not only overcome
the disadvantages associated with injection depot but more importantly can improve
therapeutic efficacy and achieve more durable treatment outcome than the current SERD
regimen To move ZBtowards clinical trials we propose to conduct IND enabling studies
that will initiate CMC chemistry manufacturing and control work and investigate the in vivo
efficacy of oral ZBin two xenograft models The dose dependent efficacy studies are the
next key steps to determine if the oral bioavailability of ZBcan be translated to in vivo
efficacy Optimization of synthetic procedure for use in scale up preparation of GLP and GMP
grade ZBis necessary to custom manufacture the API Project Narrative
Fulvestrant is currently the only FDA approved selective estrogen receptor degrader SERD to
treat breast cancer patients with progressing disease after previous endocrine therapy The
major limitation of fulvestrant suffers from the well known poor bioavailability and the standard
intramuscular route of administration have negatively impacted its widespread use
Development of orally bioavailable SERDs to improve therapeutic efficacy and to overcome
clinical disadvantages associated with fulvestrant is an ongoing effort Zenopharm has recently
designed synthesized and tested ZB an orally bioavailable SERD that demonstrated
superior bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profiles in mice Compared to fulvestrant ZB
afforded overfold higher plasma drug concentration at a modest dose of  mg kg in mice If
such enhancement of oral bioavailability can be translated to humans ZBholds the promise
of being a viable oral SERD which can not only overcome the disadvantages associated with
high dose intramuscular injection but more importantly can further increase the therapeutic
efficacy and achieve more durable treatment outcome than the current SERD regimen In this
SBIR phase  application we propose to optimize method of preparation for ZBand to
investigate the dose dependent efficacy of orally administered ZB The proposed IND
enabling studies are crucial pre clinical studies to validate the therapeutic utility of ZBand to
prepare for IND filing for clinical trials"

The protected component is the on-site intelligent electronic controller installed to perform energy management in a home or business. The controllerâs responsibilities include monitoring and controlling local devices such as lighting, appliances, and HVAC systems to reduce energy use and lower costs. In the SCADA architecture of the new Smart Grid, such controllers are a key component of demand response and other resource controls. For example, a controller receives a demand response directive from the utility provider via an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) channel. The controller then responds by reducing local resource use. The controller is typically also connected to the Internet, e.g. to obtain weather data or allow the home or business owner remote access. Controller vulnerabilities allow an intruder to perform actions such as shutting down all controlled electrical devices. A hardware-based protection system is proposed to secure the controller, ensuring it is not compromised. The protection system is transparent to the controller, has full monitoring and control access, and is interfaced in a way that makes it much more difficult to compromise than the controller itself."

The result is development of a business model where an eye exam is administered, prescription lenses are printed and glasses assembled and dispensed in a single visit. Upon completing the refraction portion of the eye exam, the lens prescriptions will be electronically transferred to the optical lens printer. The lens blanks, pre-treated for UV and anti-scratch protection, will contain a laser writable photopolymer layer that accepts and freezes the personalized prescriptions. Eyeglasses produced with this method will be of equal or higher in optical quality compared to traditional lenses and can be produced at a fraction of the cost of conventional lenses. This method of producing ophthalmic lenses both reduces the turnaround time for securing eyeglasses but equally important, will significantly reduce the cost for producing eyeglasses translating to lower the retail prices. Considering that over 60% of the US population wears glasses and a much high percentage of families have members that depend on glasses, this project will benefit the vast majority of US taxpayers. The goal of this STTR Phase 1 proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of three coupled innovations: 1) a high-speed optical printer for 2) photosensitive ophthalmic lens blanks that record 3) novel gradient-index diffractive optics which provide dramatically improved fabrication cost, visual performance and lighter weight over existing lens making technologies. The target application will be low cost, low and higher order aberration correcting eyeglass lenses fabricated with a compact, inexpensive optical printer. Lenses produced with this light based process will match or exceed the optical quality of current free form lenses made with computer numerical controlled milling machines costing in the range of $250k to $500k. This proposed lens making innovation enables the development of an eyeglass dispensing business model that could eliminate the need for conventional centralized eyeglass labs, the associated distribution networks, a comprehensive inventory of lens blanks and the long wait times for procuring prescription eyeglasses. The developments of this STTR will allow ophthalmic practices to better serve their patients, enabling on-site fabrication of superior corrective lenses that more closely match eye deficiencies. By the end of phase I, the goal is to optimize the photopolymer materials, refine the light sources and complete an engineering model of the optical printer."

For example, by directly fabricating these parts at the micron scale, perturbations such as global scaling (to implement magnifying arrays), global rotation (to implement image inverters) or local scaling (to implement modal tapers or integrated lenslets) can be created in a single process step. Unlike current methods which must draw out a minimum of km from a preform, here single parts can be cm in length. The imaging arrays have significant commercial potential as replacements for current endoscopes, fiber face plates and image inverters. They also enable new markets including inexpensive eye monitoring for clinical and public safety applications, wearable gaze-tracking for human-computer interface for paralysis victims, and ultra lightweight heads-up displays for military and consumer entertainment. The team will develop both the lithography and materials to create these all-polymer imaging cables. The transport and manipulation of optical images is ubiquitous but nearly uniformly implemented with delicate, rigid lens trains. Discrete imaging devices such as fiber bundles are sufficient for modern digital displays and cameras and are naturally robust, but currently limited by cost and capability. By enabling flexible, lightweight transport of
discrete images, the results will impact ? Education, Medical and Biological Research and Macular Degeneration. The Phase I including supplementary funding has partially funded 7graduate, 1 post-doc and two undergraduate students. An exchange of graduate students with Dublin Ireland extended this impact. The lithography system has been used in multiple undergraduate class projects and for multiple cross-disciplinary graduate research programs.

Thick photopolymers respond to 3D optical exposure with a self-developing index structure, typically proportional to absorbed energy. Traditional mask-projection lithography cannot address these thick volumes. In this project, the image of the mask is projected perpendicular to the surface of the polymer and translated through an arbitrarily long polymer sample. An unchanging mask will write translational-invariant waveguide arrays or photonic crystal fibers. These photonic crystal fibers do not require large index contrast, matching the properties of photopolymers. Dynamic masks including spatial light modulators or mask rotations extend the capability to complex waveguides with adiabatic variations along their length.The proposed project will evaluate the potential properties of the guided-wave structures, their capabilities for lightweight heads-up displays, and will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed lithography method.The imaging arrays have significant commercial potential as replacements for current endoscopes, fiber faceplates and image converters. The proposed technology is also enabling for new market applications including inexpensive eye monitoring for public safety applications, wearable gaze tracking for human-computer interface for cursor control, market studies, and control of wheel chairs for the handicapped. The technology also has application for military applications for the fabrication of non-intrusive, eyeglass frame embedded heads-up displays."

There are no commercially available membranes that provide all of these features. The research objectives of this project are to create the first DNA templated ceramic thin film and provide evidence of its structural characteristics. High throughput experimentation will be used to determine the optimum conditions to form the monolayer of uniformly oriented DNA in the presence of sol-gel. The conditions for the polymerization of the sol-gel to form the silica encapsulated DNA on a surface will also be determined. It is anticipated that analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy will confirm the existence of a highly oriented monolayer of silica encapsulated DNA on a surface.

new membranes have significant advantages over existing organic polymer-based membranes. Zeomatrix is targeting the ceramic nanofiltration membrane market. It is estimated that the inorganic membrane market is approximately $375 million per year. The nanofiltration market segment, while smaller than the microfiltration segment, is growing at a rate of roughly 8% per year. The rapid growth of oil costs is expected to dramatically increase the potential market for viable alternatives such as biomass. Potential customers for the first inorganic membrane Zeomatrix will produce are biorefineries which convert woody biomass to sugars, organic acids, and alcohols. Current membrane technologies can separate the sugars from acetic acid and furfurals. However, a new membrane technology is needed which will separate furfural compounds from acetic acid.

CVOCs are ubiquitous groundwater pollutants. Left on their own they persist in
 nature for over 100 years. Most are toxic to humans, and some (including trichloroethylene) have been linked to cancer. A recently completed 17 year study by the United States Geological Survey found that chlorinated VOCs are present in nearly every aquif
er in the United States. It is estimated that full scale remediation of these compounds in groundwater will cost in excess of 200 billion. The product being developed is a visible light photocatalyst which will promote the rapid reduction of CVOC compound
s to less toxic materials. Current commercial photocatalysts are employed as oxidative catalysts, and thus they are less efficient at remediation in the presence of dissolved organic matter, a common component of groundwater. Zeomatrix utilizes high throug
hput screening methods to rapidly and cost effectively develop new photocatalysts. The Phase I research will be performed using custom-designed parallel photocatalyst screening instrumentation in order to evaluate a large number of candidate materials and
identify the optimal reductive photocatalyst. The research will be focused on the following specific aims: one, to synthesize an array of catalyst support geometries based on design of experiments (DoE) protocol and using an automated deposition system cus
tom-engineered by Zeomatrix to deposit various metal/metal oxide combinations and then screen for reductive photocatalytic activity under visible light; and, two, to screen the reductive photocatalysts selected from the initial screening experiments for ac
tivity versus chosen test compounds (trichloroethylene, trichloroethane), under a range of experimental conditions (pH, ionic strength, dissolve organic content). Selection of the optimal photocatalyst will be based on rapid degradation kinetics (turn over
 frequency), and efficacy under adverse conditions (high ionic strength, pH extremes, and high dissolved organic content). The results of the Phase I research will be used to determine the feasibility of applying the selected photocatalyst for the remediat
ion of CVOCs. Phase II studies would be performed to further optimize the photocatalyst, and to perform a large scale pilot study on actual polluted groundwater. The combination of rapid kinetics with the use of low cost visible light would make this an at
tractive remediation option to address the extensive problem of CVOC contamination. The goal of this research is the development of a novel remediation technology for the break down of chlorinated volatile organic carbons in water. Chlorinated vola
tile organic carbons are found in nearly every aquifer in the US. Left on their own they persist in nature for over 100 years. Most are toxic to humans, and they accumulate in fatty tissue making them a danger to human health even at low levels. Some have
been linked to cancer and over twenty are currently regulated in public water supplies by the United States Environmental Protection Agency."

New products designed to maintain optimal levels of NO during the various phases of wound healing would be important solutions for enhanced healing of chronic wound. This project has two aims: a) prove efficacy of zeolites containing NO in improving healing in chronic wounds. This will be accomplished in animal models of impaired wound healing using non-invasive optics to monitor wound healing and b) develop a hydrogel that achieves controlled release of NO to the tissue.
The broader/commercial impacts of this research are significant: if successful, the product developed could reduce the estimated US healthcare costs of more than $10 billion annually associated with treating diabetic foot ulcers and related amputations. Furthermore, approximately 3.2 million Americans who are affected by leg ulcers would be provided with effective treatment. Recurrence rate of these ulcers is as high as 70% and the annual cost is estimated to be $3.5billion.

This mapping can be used to reconstruct higher resolution mages from the observed low resolution frames thereby increasing the optical system resolution without changing the hardware. To be useful under operational conditions, the microscanning algorithms must work in real-time. Presently employed registration and reconstruction algorithms use iterations that slow the process down. The goal of this project is to increase the speed of the algorithms by removing the iterations. This will be accomplished by identifying local constraints that conserve the image properties. We have already successfully employed local constraints to remove the interations from segmented adaptive optics control algorithms. To further increase the speed of the microscanning process, we will also parallelize the non-iterative image registration algorithm. We will demonstrate that the parallel computation is well suited to handle cases where the images contain moving objects.

There is considerable proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and, antimicrobials that do not develop resistance is of significant societal interest. Silver-based antimicrobials are filling this need, and are being used in a variety of medical, consumer and food-related applications. Silver is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, effective against gram positive, gram negative bacteria (including methicillin-and vancomycin resistant bacteria) as well as fungi, viruses, and biofilms. This has led health care, consumer and food industries to use silver antimicrobial products. The global market for silver-based powder antimicrobial coatings is currently valued at $910 million and expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.1% until 2020. Concerns however, are increasing about the release of silver and the resulting influence on the environment. Development of high potency silver products using the minimum amount of silver can significantly broaden its use. The benefits of this versatile antimicrobial platform include: 1000-fold increased potency, decreased cost, invisibility and compatibility with formulations. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and test a highly potent silver-based antimicrobial product. Higher potency is due to control of size of ligand-free AgNP (1-3 nm) anchored to the surface of ~30 nm nanozeolite (NZ), and fast release of Ag+ within the zeolite. The bactericidal activity of AgNP-NZ has been examined with E. coli (gram negative) and antibiotic resistant MRSA (gram positive), with significant improvement. The potency is further enhanced by modifying the NZ support to introduce multiple features: increased antimicrobial activity via NZ ion-exchanged Zn2+, and surface modification of NZ to enhance interactions with bacteria, including penetration within the bacteria. At the conclusion of this SBIR Phase I project, the product will be ready for further commercialization and marketing by (1) demonstrating the scalability of the synthesis procedure so that there is enough supply of product in the product development process; (2) optimizing synthesis procedure of antimicrobial material according to antimicrobial property, including Ag+ and Zn2+ loading and surface modifications; (3) obtaining third party test reports on optimized samples as objective evidence for marketing and (4) studying the toxicity of the product toward mammalian cells to address toxicity concerns.

There are many reasons why, including growing software complexity and required rapid development needed to quickly deliver systems. Unreliable software is especially problematic in high-value systems such as critical infrastructure (e.g., the power grid) or military and government systems where bugs can result in severe security breaches. To improve software quality, we propose augmenting the software development process with automatic bug finding. This approach goes beyond merely using inadequate programmer-developed tests. Instead, software bugs are immediately and automatically discovered pre-deployment. Using Zafl, our automatic bug-finding system based on binary-only fuzzing, serious bugs can be found early in development. Being binary-only, Zafl easily integrates with complex build systems as no changes are necessary to the development processes. Instead, Zafl operates directly on built binary programs (which must already be packaged and shipped before software use). Key benefits of this approach are finding bugs in any source language (compiled in any manner), and automatically filing actionable bug reports. We propose to containerize Zafl for easy scaling to production environments and include automatic bug reporting and forensics to help developers deploy significantly more dependable and secure software."

The defenses can be thought of as a control system, in which sensors detect attacks and actuators provide graded responses to attacks.

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disease affecting millions of American military veterans
and civilians. Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is evidence-based and effective but limited by high dropout rates
and incomplete resolution of symptoms in approximately one-third of patients. A crucial component of PE, as
well as interventions for anxiety disorders, is âIn Vivo Exposureâ (IVE) during which patients approach safe but
avoided stimuli in the âreal world.â Typically, patients are given in vivo assignments to complete in-between
therapy sessions, which leaves providers reliant upon patient self-report and may increase risk for patient
disengagement and dropout. At present, there are no digital technology systems that target IVE. The proposed
study directly addresses this critical gap by using intelligent biometrics (IB) to personalize and optimize IVE. The
new system (IB-PE) includes a multidimensional data acquisition and storage system to capture real-time
biomarkers of engagement (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance) and self-report (e.g., subjective units of distress
or SUDS) during IVEs, enabling therapists to virtually accompany patients during IVEs (without leaving the office)
and modify the exercises based on objective biometrics of activation to ensure maximal efficiency and
therapeutic benefit, thereby eliminating traditional shortcomings of standard PE. Furthermore, the system will
record IVEs for offline analysis. Key innovations are thatâfor the first timeâclinicians will be able to
participate in the IVE experience from the office, use real-time biometrics to optimize IVEs and minimize
patient under- or over-engagement, and have the benefit of reviewing IVEs offline to guide treatment
planning. This Phase 1 project will: (1) Integrate physiological biomarker sensors with SUDS and audio/visual
streaming into a system for office-based therapists to use during IVE; (2) Determine feasibility and acceptability
of the new system by measuring ease of use, comfort and utility in a real-world environment; and (3) Conduct a
12-session randomized clinical trial in 40 veterans with PTSD to evaluate preliminary efficacy of IB-PE in
reducing PTSD severity from baseline to session 12. In addition, recorded IVE sessions will be analyzed to
identify biological and behavioral indicators with high predictive value of treatment response. At the conclusion
of this project, a comfortable and unobtrusive system will be ready for larger definitive trials of IB-PE. It is
expected that the IB-PE system will, through technology-enabled human support and guidance, result in clinically
significant reduction of PTSD symptoms achieved with fewer sessions, thereby lowering costs and improving
access. This application is directly responsive to the FOA (PA-18-579) encouraging STTR grant applications to
support research and development of priority research topics - complex technologies that require funding levels
and durations beyond those reflected in the standard STTR guidelines. The findings from this study have the
potential to innovate and transform clinical practice, and significantly improve exposure therapy for PTSD.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and debilitating psychiatric condition. Prolonged Exposure
(PE) therapy is an effective, evidence-based treatment for PTSD; however, approximately one-quarter of
patients drop out prematurely and one-third who do complete treatment remain symptomatic. The proposed
study will employ a novel mobile technology system to optimize patient engagement, retention and clinical
outcomes."

The purpose of the work effort is to develop a concept for a non-intrusive device for attaching specialized Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) tools to underwater threat objects that can neutralize these threats. The solution developed must be effective on various surface materials and attachable on target objects that are on the seabed and in the water column with current speeds up to 14 m/s. To address these operational requirements, Zero-G Horizons Technologies, LLC. (ZGHT) aims to develop and deliver the Gecko-gripper for EOD with Cavitation Cleaning Operation (GECCO) system. GECCO is a system that can be integrated with existing Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) or EOD Underwater Response Vehicles (URVs), which includes Teledyne SeaBotix vLBV300, SRS Fusion, and VideoRay Defender, that enables rapid attachment of EOD tools or other payloads on a submerged target surface, such as underwater threat object (UTO). In most cases, the surface of a submerged target surface will be covered in biofouling, prevents firm adhesion to the surface. Also, the geometry and roughness of the surface will be flat, curved, smooth, or irregular. To deal with these problems, GECCO will remove the biofouling growth or other sediments on the target area using our controlled cavitation technology (CCT) and an underwater vacuuming mechanism. CCT can effectively remove biofouling on various surface materials and scale to a larger area with a shorter removal time. The ZGHT-developed vacuuming mechanism also supplements CCT-cleaning to clean loose biofouling and debris. The soft-robotics technology is employed for the gripper so that it can maintain grip by conforming to the target surface geometry. Moreover, it can be customizable and scalable for new designs. Biomimetic mechanisms that imitate the suction cups of an octopus, or a squid, were very effective. Preliminary results show that the suction-cup-inspired mechanism is a promising mechanism for the GECCO system. The added advantage is easy removal of the attached device by relieving the pressure without residuals. The objective of the Phase II effort is develop and integrate the biofouling cleaning and payload attaching subsystems into a full GECCO system. Supporting subsystems will encompass power supply, vehicle-ROV integration, and GECCO transport. Once implemented, the completed GECCO system will be validated through testing and evaluation in laboratory and field environments.Â Laboratory-based testing will entail experimental replication of wave action, pressure environments, and current velocities that are anticipated during operational deployment. The validated GECCO system will enable operators to reliably and efficiently neutralize underwater threat objects and ensure the safety of our global waters."

In traditional analog-to-digital conversion, the signal is ?blindly? converted without any consideration to what the signal type or statistics are. As a result, the conversion process wastes a great deal of power. If the signal type or statistics are used wisely, the ADC power can be pushed to its lower limit. ADCs using a lossless signal compression data conversion technique are proposed, delivering up to an order of magnitude lower power than competing techniques. All these benefits come at no degradation of the effective number of bits (ENOB) and conversion rate compared to the traditional ADCs. Furthermore, the compression ADC needs no pre-knowledge of the signal type. Once signal input is plugged in, the ADC will automatically adapt to the power-optimized state of the input signal. This project?s objectives are to design, simulate and fabricate the compression-based ADC chip to validate its low power capabilities. The broader/commercial impacts of this project are major benefits in extended battery life, lower design costs, higher channel density, and simplified system design in many electronic systems. With compression-based ADCs that consume much less power, several critical objectives can be attained- 1) battery life of portable devices enhanced, 2) the number of channels in a multichannel systems can be increased, 3) system resolution or speed can be enhanced, and 4) device form factor can be reduced due to higher channel density per chip. With these benefits, end-users experience improved device portability, attain more accurate sense and detection, and overcome design challenges in severely power constrained systems. The technology would also enable new applications in low power electronics that were once deemed very challenging. With ADCs found in a high percentage of electronics, compression ADCs will be serving a growing $2.8 billion data converter market, playing multiple applications in medical, wireless, instrumentation, and military technologies."

The ZestBiomission is aligned with USDA NIFA priorities of developing new processes formanufacturing biobased chemicals from US agricultural resources. The United States isuniquely positioned as a world leader in fruit and vegetable processing including sugarproduction from sugar beets (37 million tons/yr) and citrus juicing (3 million tons/yr).However the peel and pulp byproducts from processing lack value-adding technologies.The proposed research aims to develop a value-adding in vitro enzymatic conversiontechnology for the conversion of pectic monosaccharides into specialty chemicals. Thisenzymatic strategy can enable rapid bioprocessing with reduced handling and capexrequirements compared to conventional approaches such as chemical synthesis orfermentation. The first chemical product from this bioprocessing technology can beformulated as a chelant for water treatment applications. This formulation exhibitssuperior calcium and heavy metal binding compared to established biobased chelants.Thus it satisfies the growing demand for sustainable and high-performing chemicals. Theoverall project goal is to engineer improved enzymatic activity for the in vitromanufacturing process. First we propose screening of a variety of natural enzymes andtheir homologs for activity in pectin hydrolysate. Second we propose mutagenesis of theenzyme sequence and identifying high activity mutants using a microbial growth selection.The anticipated results from this work plan are improvements in enzyme activity sufficientfor commercially viable enzymatic bioprocessing. Implementation of thisbiomanufacturing process can increase overall crop revenue. This offers reduced volatilityin crop value financial sustainability for farmers and construction of rural-locatedfermentation facilities to create high paying technical jobs. Furthermore by using existingcrop byproducts our products will have a lower carbon footprint compared to competingchemicals made from petroleum or purified sugar.1

The United States is a leading producer of pectin-rich byproducts, including the citrus (>5 million tons annually), apple (>5 million tons annually) and sugar beet (>37 million tons annually) industries. With this platform fermentation technology, it is possible to perform specific chemical conversion of these US byproducts into value-adding products. Implementation of this technology can increase overall revenue from crops far exceeding current byproduct mitigation strategies. This offers reduced volatility in crop value, financial sustainability for farmers, and construction of rural fermentation facilities. Furthermore, by using existing crop byproducts and eco-friendly fermentations, the resulting chemical products will be have lower environmental impact than competing chemicals made from petroleum or sugar.

Each year, large volumes of agricultural byproducts, such as citrus peels and sugar beet pulp are produced, but lack value-adding technologies. By using novel scientific breakthroughs in microbial metabolism and tools for strain engineering, microbial organisms can be engineered to convert the sugars from these byproducts into useful chemicals through environmentally sustainable fermentation. The goal of this Phase II project is to improve the production rate for the synthesis of the first chemical product using this technology. The first objective is to improve the oxidative metabolism of the host organism to aid in strain productivity. The second objective is to use a combinatorial library of strains to refine and optimize the microorganisms' fermentation rate.

The initial target chemical product is used as a chelator in cleaning products and a precursor to plastics. Other chemical products potentially may be produced using this platform. Implementation of this fermentation process offers a lower carbon footprint and emissions compared to petroleum or even other sugar-derived products, and has impact in reducing waste and combating climate change. When implemented at scale, these fermentation processing plants will be co-located with rural agricultural processing plants, adding high-tech jobs in these areas, and offering a means to de-risk historically volatile crop harvests by accessing alternative markets. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to engineer yeast strains capable of converting sugars in pectin-rich agricultural wastes into valuable specialty chemicals. Currently, the fermentation rates for utilizing the primary sugar in pectin, D-galacturonic acid, limits production of these chemicals, including the proposed first product, which is a biodegradable metal chelator. Previous characterization has identified that uptake of the pectin sugars by a transporter as the limiting step. Accordingly, the first objective of this proposal is to characterize this class of transporter to identify new transporters with improved rates. The second objective is to improve the best transporter through protein engineering. Using this improved transporter, the final objective will assess the cellular energy requirements for the fermentation process using bioreactors to control fermenter conditions, as product synthesis and transport is energy-demanding.

that have skeletal metastases, or approximately 115,000 new patients per year in the US. Lytic lesions, or
void-defects in the bone, result from local bone destruction caused by tumor cell-directed osteoclastic bone re-
absorption and lead to pathologic fractures and increased patient morbidity. Surgical intervention is necessary
to prevent initial fracture or other skeletal related events and involves stabilizing the defect created by the
tumor. Unfortunately, a growing population of patients are at risk for implant failure due to the inability of
hardware or bone cement to promote bone formation. Because of high failure rates and increased patient
survival, lytic lesions account for approximately $2-billion in US healthcare expenditures per year.Patients with breast cancer bone metastases (i.e. a skeletal related event) require surgical intervention
to stabilize the tumor-directed defect using intra-medullar nails, total joint prostheses, and/or bone cement.
However, hardware and bone cement donât promote bone formation. The underlying unfilled bone defects can
result in implant loosening and loss of mechanical stability. Growth factors have become a popular option to
increase bone healing. However, these therapies, such as BMP-2 (InfuseÂ®) and PTH (ForteoÂ®), have safety
risks for cancer patients and some have been contraindicated for use or given a black-box warning by the FDA
for patients with active tumor or patients with history of tumor. In particular, BMP-2 has been associated with
increased tumor risk in patients who are undergoing X-radiation therapy or possess nascent undetected tumor.In response to this unmet need, Zetagen Therapeutics, Inc., a New York regenerative medicine startup
is commercializing the Naloventâ¢ Bone Graft, a new combination product with a demonstrated ability to
treat lytic lesions by inducing osteogenesis while inhibiting local growth of cancer cells. Based on the
discovery of a novel molecular pathway for bone growth, Nalovent induces osteogenesis via the local
implantation of a calcium phosphate bioceramic / bovine collagen-based bone graft that contains the opioid
antagonist, naloxone. If validated, the Nalovent Bone Graft would empower clinicians with a much-needed
solution to heal lytic bone defects and fight residual tumor in order to deliver significantly improved outcomes to
the large and growing population of breast cancer patients with skeletal metastases.This proposal consists of three AIMs meant to drive the Nalovent Bone Graft towards FDA approval
using standard safety, bioavailability, and efficacy assessments: 1) Assess the safety of Nalovent, 2) Test the
bioavailability of Nalovent and 3) Validate that the Nalovent Bone Graft promotes bone growth. If successful,
this proposal will demonstrate commercial validation for the Nalovent Bone Graft implant and establish the
foundation for the preparation for first-in-man trials.Project Narrative:
Bone growth is critical to a favorable prognosis in the 70% of de novo metastatic breast cancer patients that
have skeletal metastases. Destructive bone defect â or lytic lesion â result from local bone destruction caused
by tumor cell directed osteoclastic bone re-absorption. The Nalovent Bone Graft, a combination device that
delivers a small molecule drug, has demonstrated the ability to grow bone in a lytic bone tumor defect adjacent
to an active breast cancer tumor in mice. Further, following the completion of product development and

We will upgrade existing real-time BioTOF signal processing and classification software to incorporate multiplex classification capability and statistically analyze performance.During the first three months of this effort, we will integrate these enhancements to produce the first High-Performance BioTOF system. After integration, we will verify operability and performance with simulant mixtures, followed by testing in BSL-2 with mixtures of five inactive agents. A second system will be completed by the end of month six, and we will begin field testing as these systems are completed. Two additional systems will be completed by month 14 allowing us to ramp up field testing from two to four sites. To examining signature stability over time, one of these systems will undergo inactive agent testing in MRIGlobalâs BSL-2 laboratory during year two. Using agent data collected at MRIGlobal we will train a classifier to detect both single agents and mixtures of up to five agents.

Current screening tools are either non-specific, or are slow, costly, and reagent burdened. As with most respiratory pathogens, such diseases are primarily spread through human discharge of pathogen-containing droplets created by coughing, sneezing or even normal breathing. The ability to rapidly, accurately, and affordably screen environment for a wide range of aerosolized pathogens arising from agricultural sources and human exhaled breath is critical to control the spread of these types of communicable diseases. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful analytical technique for fast identification of biomolecules because of its high speed, specificity, and sensitivity. Real-time analysis of airborne particles containing pathogen organisms by field-portable MS-based system will help identify infected individuals and improve response and management to mitigate disease spread. The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a field-portable mass spectrometry-based diagnostic/screening system that analyzes respired aerosols on-the-fly and provides rapid, accurate information about the infectiousness of the patient at extremely low cost-per-sample. The proposed system that combines efficient bioaerosol collection coupled with rapid processing and miniature mass spectrometer will provide a novel, non-invasive methodology for sensitive detection of infectious persons. The capability to conduct automated and constant air monitoring for presence of aerosolized pathogens will radically improve the ability to deal with pandemic threats"

The specific, accurate mass of ions formed in the ionization source and measured in the mass analyzer gives a mechanism for identification of the analyte. Characteristic fragmentation of the molecular species provides additional information that enhances specificity. Thus, mass spectrometry is considered one of the gold standards for identifying chemical compounds. In recent decades, the applicability of mass spectrometry has been extended to the study of large biological molecules. The advent of advanced biological mass spectrometry techniques such as electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) has resulted in the ability to detect and identify large biological molecules, characteristic of many key bacterial metabolites and microorganisms such as virus, bacteria and fungi. Our team has a long history of the use of the MALDI technique coupled to miniaturized time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometers to create biological identifiers that move mass spectrometry out of the lab and into the field.nbsp;This effort will augment existing capability to automatically collect, process, detect and identify a wide range of biological contaminants in air, water and on surfaces.

RSV is the leading cause of bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia, respiratory failure, and mechanical ventilation in infants. It causes gt120,000 infant hospitalizations per year in the USA and is the leading cause of infant viral death. In the elderly, RSV causes one third of pneumonia hospitalizations. In children and adults, RSV infection is a major cause of acute asthma exacerbations. There is no licensed vaccine. Experimental RSV vaccines including inactivated, live attenuated, subunit, viral-vectored, and DNA have been developed and tested in animal models and small clinical trials. However, these have been largely unsuccessful. Inactivated and subunit vaccines have a history of causing immunopathology. Live attenuated RSV vaccines are safe. However, attenuated RSVs characteristically induce transient/poor immunity like wild-type RSV.We are developing novel virus-like particle (VLP) RSV vaccines. VLPs are genetically engineered complexes of proteins in a particulate virus-like structure that lacks viral genetic material and therefore cannot replicate. Viral proteins presented as VLPs are highly immunogenic and induce protective humoral, cellular, and mucosal immune responses. We have extensive experience expressing viral proteins on VLPs and evaluating VLP-induced immunity. The RSV fusion (F) and attachment glycoprotein (G) contain all known neutralizing antibody epitopes and several T cell epitopes. We hypothesize that VLPs expressing RSV F, G, or both F and G surface will induce strong RSV-specific immune responses and immunity.In Aim 1, we will generate VLPs using a recombinant baculovirus system to express VLP proteins in insect cells and gradient ultracentrifugation to purify VLPs. We have experience with these methods which are FDA approved for human use and scalable for production. We will generate RSV-G, RSV-F, and RSV-GF VLPs by co-expressing these proteins with influenza matrix M1 protein as the VLP core. VLPs co-expressing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) proteins exhibit enhanced cellular and humoral responses. We will generate RSV VLPs with and without anchored GM-CSF. Also, we will optimize immunogenicity by testing three different co-administered adjuvants, aluminum hydroxide (alum), CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN), and monophosphoryl lipid (MPL). The latter two adjuvants stimulate toll- like receptor signaling pathways known to be important for anti-RSV responses. In Aim 2, we will define the immunogenicity and efficacy of these RSV VLP vaccines in a mouse model. Mice will be primed and boosted with VLPs intranasally. RSV-specific antibody (IgG and IgA) and T cell responses will be quantified after immunization. To determine protection, we will challenge mice with a recombinant, chimeric RSV strain known to give higher lung viral loads than laboratory RSV strain in BALB/c mice. Collectively, these experiments will advance RSV VLP vaccine development and may lead to a much needed approved RSV vaccine.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes apprimately 120,000 infant hospitalizations in the US each year and is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and viral death in infants. Despite decades of research with traditional vaccine approaches, there are no approved RSV vaccines. We are advancing virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines for RSV, and we predict RSV VLPs will be effective and safe vaccines that prevent RSV disease."

Epidemics of seasonal influenza and increased circulation of avian influenza virus subtypes constitute a significant healthcare problem in all regions of the world, including the U.S. The annually recommended vaccination is the principal means of controlling influenza epidemics. However, the current licensed vaccines (trivalent inactivated or live, attenuated trivalent virus vaccines) provide protection only against the strains that are matched with the vaccine composition. There is no influenza pandemic vaccine available to the general public. In addition, the current vaccine production is based on egg substrates and would not meet the surge demand in vaccination during a pandemic outbreak. Therefore, development of influenza vaccines with improved protective efficacy against influenza virus is an imperative. Zetra's uniquely engineered adjuvant-containing viral nanoparticles (cVLPs) provided proof-of-concept that a broadly cross-protective, non-replicating vaccine with the possibility of cross reactivity with other influenza subtypes A and B, can be developed by the company's proprietary technology. The protective immune responses induced by these cVLPs have been maintained at high levels in mice for over 14-months. This desirable quality of our vaccines provides a potential to avoid the need to change the seasonal vaccine formulation every year. Importantly, a single immunization induced protective immunity against a high dose of challenge virus. A major goal of this project is to develop and evaluate novel adjuvant-containing influenza cVLPs vaccines against influenza virus in order to enhance broadly cross protective and long-lasting immunity. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is known to increase the immunogenicity of various co-administered antigens and is considered as an adjuvant appropriate for human use. We propose the novel approach to use GM-CSF in a membrane-anchored form in VLPs with influenza antigens. We have already developed chimeric influenza VLPs incorporating GM-CSF which show desirable vaccine qualities. Cross-protection as well as heterosubtypic protection models have been well established in our laboratory for seasonal influenza. In Phase I of this project, we will determine the cross-protective efficacy including heterosubtypic immunity induced by chimeric influenza VLPs containing the immunostimulatory molecule, GM-CSF, in well-established mouse and ferret models. The physical co-localization of the cytokine adjuvant and antigen in the same VLP is important to increase the efficacy of our novel vaccines. Our approach to development of a safe and effective vaccine that induces broadly cross protective immunity against influenza viruses will have a significant impact on public health in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Epidemics of seasonal influenza and increased circulation of avian influenza virus subtypes constitute a significant healthcare problem in all regions of the world, including the U.S. The annually recommended vaccination is the principal means of controlling influenza epidemics. However, the current licensed vaccines (trivalent inactivated or live, attenuated trivalent virus vaccines) provide protection only against the strains that are matched with the vaccine composition.

There are approximately 14,000 new HIV infections per day, and the WHO predicts th
at HIV poses the greatest threat to global health in the coming years. Having already claimed more than 20 million lives, HIV/AIDS still remains a largely unmet medical need. The severe nature and poor prognosis associated with this disease, together with
high global prevalence and lack of simple and effective treatment, have driven demand for prophylactic vaccines against HIV. As it is the case with other infectious diseases, a safe, effective and available preventive vaccine will ultimately be the preferr
ed method in our fight to end the HIV pandemic. Although developing an effective HIV vaccine remains one of the highest priorities, it also presents formidable scientific challenges to researchers. Currently, there are no HIV vaccines available. Zetra Biol
ogicals, LLC has exclusively licensed novel platform technology from Emory University for vaccine discovery, development and production. Recent data, produced by using our patent protected and patent pending technology, demonstrated that chimeric virus-lik
e particle vaccine candidates elicit strong innate and acquired immune responses. In pre-clinical studies with an early vaccine candidate we have demonstrated a broad antibody and T-cell responses against HIV-1. In Phase I of this project we are planning t
o leverage our expertise in creating novel HIV vaccine candidates and capabilities of our platform chimeric virus-like particle technology to further develop new HIV vaccine candidates. Our objective is to create chimeric VLPs with membrane-anchored toll-l
ike receptor ligands as a novel HIV-1 vaccine candidate with a goal to elicit broadly anti-HIV neutralizing antibodies and strong mucosal immune responses. The specific aims of the Phase I project are: 1) To produce chimeric virus-like particles (cVLPs) in
corporating HIV glycoproteins and membrane-anchored adjuvant molecules; 2) To evaluate the immunogenicity of novel HIV chimeric VLPs in comparison to standard VLPs containing Env and Gag proteins. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than 60 million people have b
een infected with the HIV virus, and AIDS has taken the lives of more than 20 million adults and children. With 14,000 new HIV infections every day, HIV continues to spread. Our recent studies on HIV-1 and SIV demonstrated that vaccines produced by using o
ur novel platform technology can offer an alternative strategy for development of an effective, safe, and affordable HIV vaccine. In the proposed project, we will demonstrate that novel chimeric virus-like particles with an incorporated toll-like receptor
ligand will induce and enhance immune responses against the HIV-1 virus."

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis, affecting over 30 million adults in the United States in
2015 and represents over 25% of medical office visits according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. Over 40% of individuals over 65 have symptomatic OA and
reduced mobility due to the disease. OA pain is often mitigated with conservative treatment approaches such as
water therapy, walking, cycling, and pharmaceuticals. Regular use of NSAIDs can have adverse side effects on
cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and renal systems. As such, topical NSAIDs are often used and provide similar
pain relief to oral NSAIDs. Long-duration ultrasound has been used to reduce pain and improve joint function in
patients with knee OA. When ultrasound is used in conjunction with topical pharmaceuticals, sonophoresis drives
the molecules deeper into tissue, providing improved pain relief compared to ultrasound alone or topical
application of NSAIDs alone. In our SBIR Phase I, we developed a long-duration low-intensity ultrasound NSAID-
enhanced (1% diclofenac) sonophoresis patch for use by the aging OA population. We first demonstrated that
the sonophoresis patch could increase tissue penetration of NSAIDs including salicylic acid by 3.5x and
diclofenac by 3.8x compared to standard of care (pandlt;0.01). Secondly, the sonophoresis patch was evaluated in
a 20-subject human-factors study, and a 32-subject OA clinical study on patients with radiographically confirmed
mild to moderate knee OA. In only 7-days of daily 4-hour use, symptomatic pain was significantly reduced by
2.96 point (70%) NRS (n=24, pandlt;0.001) for responders and 2.03 point (50%) NRS (n=32, p=0.02) for all subjects.
Over 95% of the study population found the device easy to use and would continue treatment for their knee OA
symptoms. For this Phase II renewal application (1) First ZetrOZ Systems will refine the design and optimize the
sonophoresis patch for shelf-life stability and device functionality/usability by the aging population. A series of
regulatory testing standards including sensitization, cytotoxicity, packaging/formulation stability, biocompatibility,
microbial growth, shelf-life and home-use will be completed on the sonophoresis patch. Additionally, a porcine
animal model with histopathology will be completed to verify the safety profile of the device. (2) ZetrOZ Systems
will complete an 8-week, 3-arm, multi-site, placebo-controlled, randomized, efficacy study to expand upon our
Phase I study by examining the health benefits and commerciality of the sonophoresis patch in 300 patients
enrolled at three ethnically diverse locations. The primary outcome of the study will be pain score, evaluated
daily using the numerical rating scale (NRS). Baseline NRS score will include the first two weeks of the study
without intervention. The intervention phase will separate three demographically equivalent groups of 100,
assigned to use either the active/placebo sonophoresis patch or standard diclofenac topical cream daily self-
applied for six weeks. The proposed combination therapy has the potential to deliver a safe, effective, and
conservative treatment approach for OA in the aging population.Project Narrative:
This project proposes to develop and evaluate the first home-use NSAID-enhanced sonophoresis patch for use
by an aging population with osteoarthritis. The technology has been evaluated in the laboratory and the clinical
setting with positive results. We will now finalize regulatory testing of the ultrasound-based drug delivery
system, and evaluate the sonophoresis patch in a multi-site clinical trial on knee osteoarthritis."

Narcotic use in pain management of underserved minority populations and minority United States veterans has
played a major role in the ongoing opioid crisis. According to the NIH, veterans are more susceptible to opioid
addiction and are 40% more likely to suffer from severe chronic joint pain then non-veterans. Over the next
decade, the percentage of minority veterans will increase from 23% to 34% and is expected to rise. This shift of
racial and ethnic minorities directly correlates to the growing demographics of minority active duty soldiers that
make up over 40% of our nationâs military forces. The federal government considers the 18.2 million veteran and
42 million non-veteran minority Americans to be andquot;potentially vulnerable patient populationsâ with health disparities
particularly related to joint diseases care. Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common of these joint diseases
affecting the entire US population, and of considerably higher 19-fold incidence and prevalence in the service-
disabled veteran population. Although the disease itself does not appear to occur more frequently in minorities,
its effects and progression are more severe. This is especially true among minorities with arthritis, 36.7% of
Black patients and 35.5% of Hispanic patients reported severe joint pain compared to only 23.0% of non-Hispanic
Whites. The economic burden of veterans with OA is estimated to approach or exceed $60 billion annually due
to longer life expectancies. Arthritis is also a significant economic and health burden in the United States at large
which is estimated to exceed $394 billion in healthcare costs by 2030. Our Phase I SBIR NIH/NIMHD HEAL
project is aimed at revolutionizing the treatment of chronic pain in the home-setting for the underserved. ZetrOZ
Systems miniature ultrasound technology can increase targeted transdermal drug delivery into tissue by 2-20
times providing effective pain relief. Additionally, the ultrasonic drug delivery technology has shown clinical
potential in reducing chronic joint pain by 50-70%. In Phase I of this project we will first (1) optimize ultrasonic
dosimetry (frequency, intensity, and treatment algorithm) for increased drug delivery, and integrate the
technologies into easy-to-apply and easy-to-use wireless systems for clinical evaluation. Secondly (2), we will
determine the clinical potential of the innovative drug delivery systems in treating minority veteran chronic pain,
by evaluating the technology in an 8-week double blind placebo controlled clinical trial on chronic joint pain. The
HEAL INITIATIVE response team includes biomedical scientists and engineers from ZetrOZ Systems (global
leader in wearable ultrasound technologies), and clinician researchers and practitioners from the James A. Haley
Veteransandapos; Hospital Tampa, Florida (a center of excellence for chronic pain management). Together, we will
develop an innovative ultrasonic drug delivery technology accessible for minorities and underserved
communities to reduce disparities and opioid use in the healthcare system of America.Project Narrative:

Specifically designed ultrasonic devices for accelerated healing and wound site debridement are generally hand-operated bulky systems. As such, they are used on a case-by-case basis with irregular therapeutic treatment regimens dependent on patient access and associated treatment costs. This limits ultrasounds effectiveness and its broad-use in the military/civilian wound healing.Recent innovation and FDA regulatory clearances by ZetrOZ in the development of portable, wearable, long duration, low intensity therapeutic ultrasound systems, allows ultrasound to be delivered and sustained for 4 hours of daily therapeutic treatment. Initial studies have demonstrated that the long duration ultrasound device speeds healing in a small-animal wound model and a pilot study of a chronic wound. Here, we propose to modify the device for optimal use in a wound healing scenario, and conduct initial large-animal studies measuring the ability of the device to facilitate accelerated wound closure and healing. The wounds will be assessed both visually and with histological sections. Following completion of this Phase I study, a Phase II study will expand on these results, and obtain GLP animal data for regulatory filings with FDA."

Pain seriously affects patients' quality of life and is associated with secondary morbidities such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance. Medications are often the first-line treatment for pain relief, but they are not without serious side effects. Particularly for rural citizens and socioeconomic disadvantaged individuals very few non-pharmacotherapy regimes exist to help manage pain. Ultrasound has been used safely and effectively for years to provide pain relief. Additionally, the mechanical and thermal mechanisms of action in ultrasound have been shown to facilitate wound and bonefracture healing, to promote the penetration of topical ointments into the skin and found to enhance a variety healthcare applications. Despite the potential of ultrasound therapy, the size, price, and mode of delivery has prohibited its broad translation. We have developed a new ultrasound device that provides a unique platform solution for ultrasound in frontline medicine in disparate and socioeconomic disadvantaged communities. The system relies on aggressive miniaturization and integration of the ultrasound transducer, electronics, and power supply to produce an iPod- sized low-intensity ultrasound system that can deliver portable, convenient, and effective therapy for long durations. For this project, the iPod-sized ultrasound devices will be refined and clinically evaluated on subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee. Subjects will be asked to wear the device for 6 hours a day over the duration of the study, and will be monitored for reductions in pain, increased mobility and their use of pharmaceuticals for pain control. Successful completion of the study will increase scientific understanding of the efficacy of low- intensity continuous ultrasound treatment on musculoskeletal pain and mobility from OA, and provide the first non-invasive, portable, transformative solution to pain control.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work is relevant to the treatment and management of osteoarthritis (OA) and chronic pain. Over 46 million people in the United States have limited mobility and pain because of OA. Here, a new non-invasive wearable therapeutic ultrasound device will be evaluated clinically, as a pharmaceutical free approach to OA management."

The large entities of the industry are often distributed, even global in nature. Multi-site collaboration is mandatory to make research progress. These, plus other needs, such as disaster recovery, make the problems even more acute. The existing data transfer solutions, both commercial and free, have shown to be woefully inadequate. So a new way of thinking and doing becomes mandatory. Zettar has introduced a hyperscale data distribution software platform which has conclusively shown in the environment of a large global biotech company to be 10X superior to all existing data transfer solutions in terms of performance, ease-of-use, robustness, and scalability. With the two proposed non- incremental innovations, it will be valuable to all the distributed data-intensive industries. During Phase I, Zettar will conduct research in 1) Parallel streaming, integrating new results with reference data in real time at very high-speed, and 2) A machine-learning (ML) based approach to optimize any data transfer set up. This helps manage data across distributed environments and/or heterogeneous architectures. The project will enable and facilitate nearly real-time analysis even when petascale data sets must be em- ployed in a distributed manner. For example, this is valuable in the efective and eecient use of output data from modern sequencing machines and electron-microscopy devices, among others."

In addition, the findings and results from this project shed a much needed light to the members of data-intensive communities (both commercial and research) regarding the importance of treating data movement as the 4th critical IT dimension, besides the traditional three: storage, compute, and networking. Furthermore, the project's outcome will show that the 4th-dimension must be defined by balanced interactions of the first three to achieve a desired data transfer speed - an important and elusive concept to grasp, but critical in using high-speed digital communications cost-effectively. Compared to the current state-of-the-art, the product resulting from this project will be far more scalable, space and energy efficient, cost-effective, and easy to deploy and use. Finally, the product will demonstrate that it can meet the data transfer needs of major scientific and commercial endeavors of this decade. This should foster accelerated progress in science and engineering, and thus also the overall national economic health. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need in modern distributed data-intensive engineering and science operations for a 4th IT dimension - data movement - besides storage, compute, and networking. To match the exponential data-growth trend, the product resulting from this project will provide high-performance data transfer and encryption. The design balances and scales in: IOPS, computation power, and network interfaces. It has a cluster-oriented architecture, using peer-to-peer technologies to ease deployment, operation, and usage. Two patent-pending algorithms help tackle data sets containing a mix of small files and very large files, and provide insensitivity to network latency. Its unique optimizations enable effective use of flash storage. The project will develop a simple, effective, and scale-out capable storage tiering software, a scale-out high-speed data encryption approach, and a scale-out approach for implementing more efficient storage I/O intensive applications. It is anticipated that data rates between two existing Data Transfer Nodes (DTNs) front ending parallel data file systems will be comparable with those from two commonly used high performance data transfer applications. With two four-node clusters, the product is anticipated to achieve 155Gbps memory-to-memory over a 16x10Gbps aggregated link and 70Gbps file-to-file with encryption over a 5000 mile 100Gbps link."

In recognition of the importance of optimization in this area, DOE & apos;s Office of Advanced Scientific Computing (ASCR) has made substantial investments in research that have led to powerful, robust software for very general classes of nonlinear optimization problems. There remains however a substantial need to extend and adapt these efforts to better take advantage of high-performance computing (HPC) and to unlock their value for new users. Power industry optimization is a particularly promising area for such an undertaking, in light of the complex decisions involved and the challenges of changing costs and technologies. We propose to focus on three complementary areas of investigation to meet this need. First, we will re-engineer nonlinear optimization software, previously developed with ASCR support, so as to take advantage of high-performance computing (HPC) concepts that address energy efficiency problems too large for current codes. Second, we will adapt and focus software technology from previous work for ASCR to address the specific needs of power grid applications, in which HPC techniques are needed in order to re-optimize very quickly a large number of problems of similar structure. Lastly we will develop new software techniques for tackling complex, large-scale power applications that model disjunctive conditions. All of these initiatives will strengthen the internals of algorithms to give the software wider applicability in HPC settings and to better deal with greatly increased problem size and complexity due to uncertainty. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: This work will be of direct public benefit by enabling scarce and costly resources to be used much more effectively for purposes of power distribution. The first area of investigation will be applied in particular to optimal power flow with contingencies and to short-term stochastic dispatch for systems with a high level of renewable penetration.

In recognition of the importance of optimization in this area, DOE & apos;s Office of Advanced Scientific Computing (ASCR) has made substantial investments in research that have led to powerful, robust software for very general classes of nonlinear optimization problems. There remains however a substantial need to extend and adapt these efforts to better take advantage of high-performance computing (HPC) and to unlock their value for new users. Power industry optimization is a particularly promising area for such an undertaking, in light of the complex decisions involved and the challenges of changing costs and technologies. We propose to focus on two complementary areas of investigation to meet this need. First, we will re-engineer nonlinear optimization software, previously developed with ASCR support, so as to take advantage of high-performance computing (HPC) concepts that address energy efficiency problems too large for current codes. Second, we will adapt and focus software technology from previous work for ASCR to address the specific needs of real-time power grid applications, in which HPC techniques are needed in order to re-optimize very quickly a large number of problems of similar structure. Both of these initiatives will strengthen the internals of algorithms to give the software wider applicability in HPC settings and to better deal with greatly increased problem size due to uncertainty. This work will be of direct public benefit by enabling scarce and costly resources to be used much more effectively for purposes of power distribution. The first area of investigation will be applied in particular to optimal power flow with contingencies and to short-term stochastic dispatch for systems with a high level of renewable penetration. The second area will be applied in improving grid short-term management, from both technical and economic stand- points, particularly in taking full advantage of new demand side management and generation technologies to reduce costs and environmental impact subject to security constraints."

As mobile devices become more powerful and ubiquitous, text entry remains a major bottleneck to the wider adoption of mobile computing. To address this urgent need in lack of an acceptable solution, this TFI technology enables high-speed input in mobile devices and gaming applications using conventional typing techniques and keyboard layouts. In addition to demonstrating the feasibility of TFI during Phase I, the project will develop an IP strategy and a set of tools essential to future research and development. To date, one prototype has been implemented and a license agreement to commercialize some portion of the TFI technology was reached with an external partner. Completion of the Phase II research in two years will pave the way for commercialization of this innovative technology as we transition toward mobile computing. The technology developed could potentially impact a broad range of application
areas, including mobile computing, gaming, military, and mobile security. Mobile devices are becoming more powerful and ubiquitous. According to the IDC, convergent mobile devices grew 51% in 2007, and will grow from 124 million to 376 million in 2012. Data entry, however, remains a major bottleneck to the wider adoption of mobile computing. Most users are frustrated with existing input methods on portable devices, such as phones and mobile PCs. Much less a paragraph of text, simply entering a website's URL in a phone or mobile PC would be a burden for many.

Redistricting is an extremely challenging task that is commonly needed in many real-world problems, such as political/school redistricting, emergency zone design, service management, and business planning. Existing redistricting tools in the commercial market all employ a manual approach, which relies on the user to optimize various criteria in a trial-and-error manner. These manual tools are ineffective and extremely time-consuming to use. This project will build a prototype redistricting product based on a newly developed redistricting optimization algorithm and visual controls, which is much faster and more superior in optimization quality than existing algorithms, and for the first time offers the potential to meet end user requirements in an automated or semi-automated manner. The proposed project will (1) design a flexible architecture to systematically integrate a variety of optimization criteria in the new algorithm to address different needs; (2) significantly improve the computational scalability for handling large data set; and (3) evaluate the prototype product with real-world applications. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it could fundamentally change the way redistricting is performed in practice. Existing automated redistricting methods reported in academia do not meet practical needs, which is the reason that there is no product in the market that employs automated methods. With existing commercial tools, which are based on a manual approach, completing a redistricting task usually requires one or more full-time technicians working for months at a time. With the product being created from this project, even a non-technical user may generate a professional plan within minutes. Potential clients include governments (cities and counties), school districts, consulting firms who provide redistricting services, private businesses that need to optimize service delivery, and even general citizens who are interested in participating in redistricting decision making. The product targets the U.S. and international market, including both public and private sectors."

The Greek yogurt industry is on the rise. However, making authentic Greek yogurt is a wasteful process - producing 3 parts waste for every part of Greek yogurt made. An economical use of Greek yogurt waste will capture the full value of the waste materials, minimize waste transportation cost, decrease bacterial outbreak risk, and reduce the carbon footprint for the environment. In parallel, the technology will ensure a sustainable supply of a rare low-calorie natural sweetener, which was shown to help lower blood sugar and improve cholesterol levels, in addition to its antioxidant, anti-cavity and pro-digestive properties. The innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding of conversion of non-food biomass to value-added chemicals. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to use synthetic biology and metabolic engineering to develop engineered yeast as a self-renewing biocatalyst for processing the environmentally hazardous waste from Greek yogurt production into a low-calorie natural sweetener. Greek yogurt companies struggle to dispose of its waste. The waste, which contains significant amounts of lactose, cannot be discarded without a pretreatment step because it stimulates bacterial growth, polluting water systems. The research addresses this challenge through the development of self-sustained microbes as catalysts in a continuous process, allowing lactose uptake with minimal waste pretreatment. This process produces a low-calorie natural sweetener as a product, whose market supply is currently limited by production cost. Anticipated technical results include strains with high yield and productivity, a specific product purification method and successful assembly of a live yeast reactor. The design overcomes substantial financial, logistical and thermodynamic bottlenecks in Greek yogurt waste treatment, and the low-calorie natural sweetener production."

ZAI will combine technology advances in MIR/UWB waveforms, fulpol antenna designs, cross correlation processing, and pattern matching techniques. The new array antenna and cross correlation software will be used to determine the pose and dimensionality of the unknown object. This data will be compared with stored templates of expected threat objects stored in memory in all possible aspect angles. It will be a two channel, MIR/UWB, forward looking, push broom synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system. The design goal road speed will be 20 KPH.

The brown out condition occurs when a helicopter attempts to land in a sandy environment and the downwash from the rotor kicks up the sand, engulfing the aircraft in a cloud of dust. The pilot can not see the ground nor can he maneuver the aircraft for a safe landing. An onboard radar altimeter indicates the aircraft height above the ground. However, a real problem contributing to accidents and aircraft strikes is the uncommanded and unsensed drift of the helicopter either in a front to back or side to side motion. There are no sensors currently onboard to detect this motion. This slow motion can not be detected by the pilot and can result in a collision with an object or depression on the ground This proposal addresses this situation and puts forth a new concept for a small radar system. The proposed system will provide a display sufficient for the pilot to determine and correct for the drift of the platform and will allow for safe landings."

Existing remote sensing systems can estimate the biomass of coniferous forests but currently there is no method commercially available for hardwood and mixed forests. The company&#039;s airborne radar and LiDAR have demonstrated excellent reproducibility and accuracy over pine plantations. However, further research is needed to refine the combined sensor system for the estimation of biomass and carbon over hardwood and mixed forests. The system could provide for the estimation of terrestrial biomass over all forests which will be faster, more accurate, cheaper, and available for commercial and scientific surveys of biomass and carbon over all the world&#039;s forests. The system would give scientists a powerful new tool to measure the efficacy of the various techniques being studied for the uptake and sequestration of carbon in terrestrial biomass. This research will impact all public and private organizations, agencies, and individuals who own and/or manage mixed forest and timberlands. Global warming is now a recognized threat. The Kyoto Accords and the related Carbon Credit market address the reduction of greenhouse gases, specifically methane and CO2. Forestry is not yet significantly involved in the exchange of carbon credits, primarily because there is currently no method to reliably and rapidly measure terrestrial biomass. This system has the potential to be a powerful influence on mitigating global warming. It will measure biomass and carbon to a degree sufficient for carbon credit deals to be transacted using trees. The immediate result will be the planting of millions of trees which will reduce global warming."

PIN photodetector&#039;s active area. PIN electroabsorptive devices are attractive for military applications because the technology is mature and the costs are low. A preliminary operational energy estimate of an electroabsorpative PIN diode structure is low, essentially that of charging a capacitor of comparable dimensions. This energy is recoverable from the capacitor structure of a reverse biased PIN. The power required to sustain the emissivity variation is equal to the leakage currents through and voltage across the reverse biased PIN structure, and this too seems relatively low compared to the power of several alternative methods."

The majority of deployed systems have frequencies (400 MHz-30 GHz) which, in most cases, cannot penetrate the soil to the depth required for detection of buried mines and unexploded ordnance. Lower frequencies are required for penetration of the ground. However, in the lower parts of the frequency spectrum, the techniques and waveforms currently used to achieve SAR across-track range resolution, such as pulse compression or impulse waveforms, create major sources of wide-band interference to other systems when the radar is transmitting. Conversely, all other emitters operating in these crowded frequency bands cause significant levels of interference to the SAR radar receiver. Amelex proposes to investigate new SAR system components and waveforms to generate an RF signal with sufficiently low frequwency to penetrate the ground and with the ability to achieve the across-track resolution required while reducing the EMI on both transmit and receive."

This approach should produce a number of advantages in performance and cost. The use of incoherent light detection can be implemented with system components which are less complex and costly, and which would be more rugged, reliable, and robust. The main thrust of the proposed effort is to develop a preliminary design for a low cost, robust and rugged, imaging laser radar (ladar) detector/amplifier/mixer chain for a 1 x N array sufficient to form high range resolution range gates. Amelex is familiar with the existing work in the FM/CW ladar area, and has teamed with Lockheed Martin/Vought System (previously Loral Vought System) which has several ladar systems in production. Additionally, they have prototypes and new components which are at the leading edge in all areas of ladar technology. Phase I will investigate the feasibility of using new and emerging technology for low cost FM/CW waveform imaging ladar applications. Phase II will fabricate a proof-of -principle 1xN ladar array demonstration system. The proposed detector/amplifier/mixer array can be used in any commercial application of laser radar where high resolution 3-fl imaging is desirable or required.

Given the size, weight, and power restrictions of a UAV, an impulse radar is an attractive radar system alternative because it offers a lighter and lower cost solution than a traditional chirped pulse radar system. In order to be functionally useful, the antenna system for a FOPEN SAR must meet very stringent requirements in terms of bandwidth, efficiency, and sidelobe performance. These electrical requirements must be achieved in a package that has minimal impact on aerodynamic performance. Amelex proposes to study several antennas which can meet some of the requirments. These antennas will then be further investigated, using a sophisticated computer antenna RF design package, SIGLBC, to ascertain whether any of these antennas, individually and/or arrayed, can meet all of the specifications. If unable to sumultaneously meet all of the requirements, a recommendation will be made as to the optimal approach. This approach will be reflected in the development of a preliminary design for the prototype to be fabricated in Phase II. There are numerous potential commercial applications which include the remote, non-intrusive location of structures and utilities which are concealed by foliage. The same system has the potential for ground penetration which could be used to detect underground pipelines and utility wires/conduits.

Today, current analog verification methods and tools often fail to catch design mistakes, especially due to unforeseen interactions across chip subsystems, and these mistakes are a frequent cause of costly delays in bringing products to market even on chips where analog is only a small portion of the overall design ? a $63 billion market. The costs and lost profit potential related to multiple design versions can quickly run to millions of dollars and easily dwarfs the cost of providing designers access to the appropriate design tools. Using two different market analyses, the first using a digital verification market analogy and the second considering worldwide new (not slight derivatives) designs in just the AMS IC market, leads to an estimation of total available market for new analog verification solutions of $300 million annual revenue. Further extending the verification solutions with analytics and collaboration tools can potentially increase the market by a further 50% to $450 million annual revenue. Understanding A/MS verification coverage is a key component of this opportunity. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project proposes a verification coverage system for analog/mixed-signal (A/MS) integrated circuit development. Verification of today?s complex integrated circuits and systems is widely acknowledged as a critical challenge to improving design productivity. Part of the verification challenge revolves around understanding what portion of the operating space has been examined; i.e., ?covered?. Today well-accepted formal and simulation-based techniques exist to capture and measure test coverage for digital integrated circuits, but there is no corresponding commercial capability for analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Analog designers frequently spend too much time analyzing and over-testing system behavior for a small set of well understood usage scenarios while leaving significant portions of the state-space completely untested. The design exploration problem for A/MS circuits presents a critical challenge for implementing such systems due to the inherently large design space associated with these types of circuits. Key objectives for the project include productizing and extending key components demonstrated in the Phase 1 prototype. This project will deliver a commercial product to provide A/MS verification coverage data that is actionable and facilitates collaboration between design and verification teams. The resulting product will have scalability and performance to handle large complex designs."

The proposed product will automatically parse the design netlist, add the instrumentation, run the user's existing simulator, analyze the output from the instrumentation, save data to a database, and build a coverage profile.

More importantly the ideas being developed through this project have broader implications for complex systems that cross the boundaries between multiple domains and do not conform well to the highly constrained verification methods used for digital circuits. Multiple domain verification problems include integrated circuits used in combination with micro-electromechanical or opto-electronic devices, integrated circuits that are utilized in complex environments such as biomedical applications, as well as integrated circuits that are delivered in innovative forms rather than traditional packages where the verification of the entire delivery system is critical. Examples would include chips mounted directly on flexible substrates or contained within multi-chip modules that may include stacked die.

Target users of this platform would initiate live video streams, or upload video files, through a web portal or application programming interface (API) for processing services (such as transcoding to produce formats and bit-rates suitable for display on mobile devices). Building this platform is challenging due to the need to (a) provide real-time guarantees on shared infrastructure, (b) achieve linear performance scaling, (c) guarantee content security and (d) deliver high availability (99.99%). To address these challenges, the feasibility of (a) a novel, video-aware parallel and distributed stream processing framework (called Scarlet), and (b) a low-overhead isolation framework (called Shield), will be explored in phase I of this project. Scarlet's design and implementation aim for guaranteed real-time processing and linear performance scaling (up to 100 compute units) while delivering professional-grade video quality. Shield should isolate content and resources for real-time media processing on shared infrastructure; content security should be comparable with today's virtual machine (VM) technology but without the associated performance penalties.

Therefore, its effective bandgap can be narrower than that of any of the single constituent materials. In general, there are two categories of type-II alignments for heterostructures, broken-gap alignment and staggered alignment (see Fig. 1). Such a unique property of T2SL has made it a good candidate for infrared photodetector applications. Significant progress has been made recently in the research on long-wavelength IR InAs/InGaSb T2SLs. These IR detector materials have potential to outperform existing materials such as HgCdTe and InSb. In the past several years, impressive achievements have been demonstrated by several research groups in the US with strong support from MDA. This effort proposes to improve on the state of the art InAs/InAsSb strained layer superlattice devices with better interface characteristics, better reproducibility, and better carrier transport than existing technologies."

In response, we prepared two new classes of chiral stationary phases (CSPs). We prepared 10 different examples of the class wherein the chiral selector is covalently bonded to the surface of carbon-clad zirconia. Additionally, we prepared 26 different variants of the second class of CSP wherein the chiral selectors is bonded to the surface of zirconia through a Lewis acid/base coordinate covalent anchor group. We found that the second class of phase generally has much better chiral selectivity than the first and was very comparable to commercial phases based on related chiral selectors. Given the very different surface chemistry of zirconia we believe that Bronsted surface acid-base reactions with aminated drugs will be much less serious issues with zirconia based phases compared to silica-based phases. For these reasons phase II work will center on exploiting the newly developed Lewis acid-base anchored CSPs. Our four principal aims in phase II are: to extend our phase I work on 3 micron analytical HPLC particles unto 5, 7,10 and 25-micron particles for semi-prep and prep-scale LC, to scale-up production to the larger batch sizes, to characterize these larger particles made in bigger batches for their critical chromatographic properties (chiral selectivity, loading capacity, efficiency) and last to synthesize a series of Whelk O 1-like and alpha-Burke 2 emulator phases that can be used for rapid chiral selector screening in new HPLC method development to quickly determine the most appropriate type of chiral selector. To accomplish these goals we will subcontract the synthetic efforts to Prof. Tom Hoye of the University of Minnesota an international expert in the area of natural products synthetic chemistry."

With FDA approval in 2007 of the first antiretroviral drug targeting a cellular gene, the HIV coreceptor CCR5, there is now proof of concept that a cellular target can be used to develop a highly effective, safe, nontoxic and well-tolerated antiretroviral drug. Although somewhat of a paradigm shift for infectious diseases, in fact, cellular genes are targeted routinely for non-infectious diseases. In any case this demonstrates the potential for targeting cellular genes for antiviral therapy. This proposal aims to extend the work accomplished over the last several years using a proprietary technology, gene-trap, which is a rapid and efficient method for the identification of host genes that are necessary for infection, replication or pathogenesis by viruses. Gene-trap insertional mutagenesis has identified cells with genes that are not expressed; loss of these genes allows the cell to survive during lethal virus infection, but apparently is not required for cell survival. To date, we have identified several pathways used in common by a number of viruses, suggesting that there may be key cellular mechanisms necessary for pathogenesis and that blocking such mechanisms in vivo could confer broad-spectrum therapeutic intervention. Our hypothesis is that by screening siRNAs to genes identified by gene trap and confirmed by influenza virus infection and testing them in indicator cell lines and primary marrophages for HIV infection, we will discover new host gene targets that can be used to develop antiretroviral drugs. During Phase I, we will test the effects of down regulation of specific genes indicator cell lines for effect on HIV based on well-defined criteria to select lead targets for drug discovery criteria. The most important criteria is a high resolution 3D crystal structure available for the target. The importance of crystal structure is to facilitate drug discovery efforts that will begin in phase I and that will be the primary focus in phase II of the project. Using the indicator cell line U373 MAGI, which are readily transfectable with siRNA, we will test the effect on HIV replication both by beta-GAL activity, which will identify inhibition of replication at steps prior to gene expression, including entry reverse transcription and integration, and we will also measure extracellular virus by HIV p24 production and Real-time PCR for HIV RNA, to capture inhibition events that occur in the second half of the virus life cycle. By performing these two assays in parallel we determine whether the gene is important in early viral life cycle events or later ones. To confirm the relevance of these genes for HIV replication we will assess effects of gene down regulation on primary human macrophages, which are natural targets for infection. In independent studies to perform gene-trap and develop drugs for influenza virus infection, the genes that will be assessed for effects on HIV replication will have been assessed in parallel in mouse studies. Therefore, we will have animal safety data for these genes, with down regulation maintained in the animals for a period of one month. Genes identified as important for HIV infection, and meeting our criteria for drug development, will be screened with small molecule libraries with collaborators at Emory, lead by Dennis Liotta, PhD. This proposal will be likely to lead to a large number of new antiretroviral drugs that affect novel targets for therapy. PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 11/07) Page 1 Continuation Format Page PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tremendous advances have been made in treatment of HIV infection over the last ten years, with introduction of three new drugs in the last one to two years that are safe, well-tolerated and typically effective against virus strains resistant to older drugs. The HIV pipeline is not robust, however, and after several me too drugs directed to the same targets over the next several years, integrase and CCR5, there are not many other antiretroviral therapies that will be developed clinically. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new drugs against novel targets for HIV since resistance to older drugs emerges in many patients. Our proposal will identify human proteins as targets important for HIV infection that can be used to develop new classes of antiretroviral drugs.

Waste incineration has been practiced for some time and brings operational difficulties and high emissions. The proposed project advances a technology to convert waste into a a solid fuel. The proposed project advances a torrefaction solution for industrial use. Torrefied waste is significantly low in hazardous components (chlorine) and can be pulverized, enabling application as a solid renewable fuel. However, waste is a feedstock that is extremely difficult to handle and convey due to low density and large inconsistencies. The chlorine content of waste can (i) cause severe corrosion and (ii) require strict emission control, with significant increase in cost. Further, it cannot be used in pulverized fuel boilers as it is not grindable. This project advances a small torrefaction system (50 kg/hr) addressing these issues by developing: (1) a waste handling unit that downsizes to 2 mm size with a unique feeding system that avoids bridging; (2) a cramming unit that can handle hard to flow and low-density materials; and (3) a cooling system for safety; and (4) a torrefaction-extrusion reactor. This reactor does the following: (i) reduces the organic chlorine to acceptable levels; (ii) decomposes long polymeric chains and makes the material friable, thus grindable; (iii) homogenizes and downsizing the material due to mechanical mixing; and (iv) uses an integrated compaction that reduces footprint and improves the economics.

While ad-hoc distributed coherent technologies have been demonstrated CHROME will apply distributed beamforming techniques to non-developmental waveforms for cost effective communication systems with greater range and power-efficiency and lower detectability then current communications technologies.Â CHROMEâs ability to update existing tactical radios with this capability via software/firmware update is highly desirable and the approach should maximize portability and backwards compatibility to tactical radio systems which will support widespread implementation and reduce overall cost. Â The basis of CHROME is Zivaâs suite of algorithms which have been demonstrated in aircraft, small Tier 1 UAS and on the ground to coherently align radio clocks, local oscillators in phase using open-loop (implicit or retrodirective) beamforming to cancel channel impairments.Â Zivaâs open-loop approach operates in highly dynamic channels with high doppler, high levels of multipath and where any node can be master and does not require a special HQ node with TFLOP processing capability which significantly enhances military reliability, maintenance, and reduces vulnerability to single point of failure as well as broadens the CONOPS.

This will be a major breakthrough in the ability to cost effectively fabricate directly modulated lasers (even in 2-D arrays) with polarization diversity which has hitherto been only possible by using expensive, bulky and lossy external modulators. The basic principle which we demonstrated in Phase I relies on the fact that the polarization of a diode laser optical output can be influenced by the direction of the current flow. As opposed to the horizontal geometry of a waveguide diode laser, the vertical VCSEL geometry makes it possible to inject pump current in two orthogonal directions. Two electrode pairs can be placed orthogonally around the cavity and the resulting orthogonal current directions can overcome the built-in asymmetry given by birefringence to actively control the polarization of the emitted laser light.

TARDIS technology produces the optimal spatio-temporal matched filtering in any channel through Time Reversal (TR) precoding, producing significant gains and enabling diffraction-limited focusing at the intended receiver through coherent alignment of multipath echoes. Ziva""s TARDIS approach provides up to 20dB gain to the intended receiver. Implementation of TR is straightforward, robust, fully automatic, rapid, and requires no hardware beyond that of typical software defined radio (SDR) systems. TR operates by sounding the channel""s multipath propagation characteristics and using a time-reversed version of the multipath sounding as a precoding filter. The communication channel acts as the perfect matched filter which results in coherently harvesting the multipath components into TR gain.

This will be a major breakthrough in the ability to cost effectively fabricate directly modulated lasers (even in 2-D arrays) with polarization diversity which has hitherto been only possible by using expensive, bulky and lossy external modulators. The basic principle that we propose relies on the fact that the polarization of a diode laser optical output can be influenced by the direction of the current flow. As opposed to the horizontal geometry of a waveguide diode laser, the vertical VCSEL geometry makes it possible to inject pump current in two orthogonal directions. Two electrode pairs can be placed orthogonally around the cavity and the resulting orthogonal current directions can overcome the built-in asymmetry given by birefringence to actively control the polarization of the emitted laser light. We believe that this new class of device will be critical for laser-detection-and-ranging (LADAR) applications, and will open up a whole new class of devices and applications which exploit high speed polarization modulation."

PCOS affects 1 in 6 women of childbearing age, and it impacts the ability to ovulate naturally. The most common 2nd-line treatment is injectable hormones that cost $15,000-$20,000 for a 6-month course and require 5-6 clinical visits each month to avoid serious side-effects. Clinical guidelines also recommend an infrequently used laparoscopic surgery that normalizes ovulation and leads to a similar pregnancy rate to hormone injections. This funding will foster work enabling the same tissue effects as the surgery but via a minimally-invasive needle-based route of access, similar to what is commonly used in other fertility procedures. This will be significantly advantageous to patients and physicians for the following reasons: costs half as much as hormone injections, enables natural ovulation via a 1-time procedure, requires few clinical visits, and reduces rates of twins/triplets to 1-2% (as compared to 20-25% for hormones) so pregnancies will be less complicated. In the US, 75% of fertility expenses are paid out-of-pocket by patients, so drastically reducing costs will allow greater access to these treatments. The proposed project specifically seeks to fund work to characterize the feasibility of replicating the surgical effects using a minimally-invasive, needle-based approach performed under ultrasound guidance. Metrics for success for this work will be sufficient and predictable volumes of tissue affected using devices with parameters consistent with a commercially acceptable device (needle-based access, ultrasound visualization, acceptable energy delivery times and powers, and techniques falling within the skill-set of fertility physicians)."

With this wide prevalence of the sensor network, this smart, real-time earthquake detection system can detect an earthquake within a second near an epicenter and notify the other users away from the epicenter before the shakings arrive, effectively creating an earthquake early warning system for society. This same infrastructure of the smart earthquake monitoring system can be transformed to detect other natural hazards such as landslides, volcano eruptions, mine explosions, generating larger social and economic benefits. With this technology, instead of some sparse seismic recordings that we have currently, we can collect dense earthquake data from tens of thousands of locations in cities, providing a block-by-block risk-assessment of earthquake hazards in cities. This dense data promises several orders of magnitude improvement in the current earthquake hazard maps and helps the first responders, catastrophic modelers, primary insurance and reinsurance companies, city planners, and building owners to better assess the earthquake hazard risks. The granular level of the risk maps has the potential to increase the awareness of earthquake hazard risk in society. The proposed project achieves a dense and hybrid seismic network using smartphones, tablets, and stationary IoT devices. A potential outcome of this project is a next-generation Earthquake Early Warning System with a sub-second response that repurposes smartphones, tablets, and other sensors of a large IoT ecosystem for the earthquake sensor network. To achieve the performance under a second, a new earthquake early warning system that scales the massive data streaming from multiple sources, enables sensor and server communication in the fraction of a second, finally builds a new push notification framework to alert hundreds of thousands in less than a second."

This earthquake early warning system will also help operators of nuclear power plants and other utilities, transportation infrastructure and critical manufacturing facilities downgrade their operations in a timely manner ahead of a seismic event. An affordable and scalable seismic network could have as many as tens of thousands of sensors in metropolitan cities, enabling the creation of highly accurate shaking maps with resolution down to 100m (compared with resolutions of around 10km for current maps), providing valuable information for homeowners, city developers, and insurance companies to compute insurance risk and premiums. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project addresses the lack of effective early warning systems in the US and in many other earthquake prone countries. Traditional seismic networks are costly to construct and operate. This project proposes to create a scalable seismic network for a fraction of the cost of a traditional seismic network. The company plans to use inexpensive MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Sensor) accelerometers attached to internet-connected used/recycled smartphones to detect vibrations and transmit pre-processed data to a server. Fast magnitude estimation algorithms will be developed for both the client sensor devices (i.e. the smartphones) and server computing platform to reliably distinguish earthquakes from other vibration sources and to estimate the magnitude and time of arrival of tremors in affected areas. The objective is to generate a warning within two seconds of the origin of an earthquake, thereby providing sufficient time for appropriate actions to be taken in surrounding affected areas."

Range extension of 20% is anticipated to result from a combination of greater than 10% weight reduction, elimination of most or all internal structure from the baseline aluminum tank, and addition of a polymer bladder to isolate fuel from sea water that bleeds into the tank to compensate external pressure as fuel burns. The Phase I design study will include consideration of the addition of vibration and self-noise damping features to the tankâs fore and aft Â interfaces. The team includes technologists from Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, who will contribute their vast experience in underwater systems design and production, reducing risk for Phase III transition.

is the accurate registration fusion of the intra procedure TRUS with the pre acquired MRI This fusion procedure
is often performed using rigid registration which does not account for prostate deformation between the MRI and
TRUS acquisitions Eigenandapos s Artemis system is one of a newer generation of devices that performs deformable
mapping between MRI and TRUS Current fusion methods such as in Artemis  however are highly operator
dependent as they rely on semi automated TRUS segmentation by the clinician during the procedure which is
error prone time consuming and critically reliant on operator skill We propose to extend the development of
our strategy for deformable registration from Phase I based on a statistical deformation model learned from
an existing large multi institutional database N of MRI TRUS prostate image pairs We will learn the
statistics of both biopsy deformation and prostate shape clusters The model will reduce the dimensionality of
the search as well as constrain the deformation The proposed registration method will use a regional con dence

Laxatives and other remedies are typically required to alleviate symptoms, however these are often less effective in the elderly and are associated with side effects that limit compliance. Current treatment for constipation involves increasing stool water and enhancing enteric nervous system mediated colonic motility. Clinical studies and work in animal models has shown that aging reduces enteric nerve density and the activity of smooth muscle signaling pathways that promote acto-myosin interactions, and hence contraction. Here we propose a chemical screen in zebrafish to identify compounds that enhance intestinal transit through direct effects on smooth muscle. These compounds are predicted to work independently of the enteric nervous system, and downstream of the signaling molecules affected by aging, thus, they have the potential to be effective pro-kinetic agents that enhance intestinal transit in elderly patients. The proposal consists of three specific aims. The goal of the first aim is to optimize and automate a zebrafish intestinal transit screening assay to identify compounds that enhance smooth muscle contractility. The goal of the second aim is to conduct a pilot screen of a library of FDA approved drugs and novel chemical compounds to gauge the performance of the intestinal transit assay in a large scale screen. The goal of the third aim is to conduct studies that will be begin to define the mechanism of action of active compounds identified in the pilot screen. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Constipation is a common problem in the elderly and has a significant impact on overall health and quality of life. Recent studies suggest that the underlyin causes of constipation differ in elderly versus young and middle aged patients. The long term goal of this project is to identify chemical compounds that can be developed into drugs with novel mechanisms of action that can be used to treat severe constipation in the elderly."

Importantly this polarization is then probed by a synchronously pulsed laser beam, and both the spatial and temporal electric-field distribution is projected onto a COD camera by the laser Previous studies of these imaging sensors have demonstrated: a diffraction-limited spatial resolution, femtosecond temporal resolution, near DC-THz bandwidth, sub-mV/cm field sensitivity, up to 100 Hz scan rate, single-shot capability, and a signal-to-noise ratio better than 100,000:1. The Electro-optic detection has a flat (nonresonant) spectral responsivity (from near DC to several THZ) , a large detector area (> 6 cm2) , and an extended dynamic range (>10,000,000). The simplicity of the detection geometry, capability for optical parallel processing, and excellent signal-to-noise ratio make this system suitable for real-time, 2-dimensional coherent far infrared imaging applications. For the first time, a video of real-time THz imaging has been demonstrated at Rensselaer. We will build a portable THz beam system for commercial applications. In particular, we will investigate the feasibility of using a chirped optical probe pulse to read THz imaging in an Electro-optic crystal which provides the measurement of a THz wave with an unprecedented data acquisition rate. BENEFITS: A scientific breakthrough that could eventually become as important as ultrasonic, x-ray and radar technologies, may soon make it possible for us to see images of electric fields, diseased tissue, the chemical composition of plants, identification of suspicious materials, and much more that is undetected by other imaging systems."

Present spectrum analyzers work at either microwave frequencies or in the far infrared, and only source specific detection mechanisms are available, limiting broad comparison and classification. The characterization of high power sources is essential as the health impact (if any) of such devices is investigated, and the classification of these devices based on power frequency distribution by an independent and common spectrum analyzer is essential for side-by-side comparison. We propose to implement a true THz spectrum analyzer using a rapidly scanning circular involute delay line coupled with a high speed broadband pyroelectric detector in a modified Michelson interferometer configuration. During phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of this approach coupled with both pulsed and CW THz sources. In phase II, we will realize a compact (12""x8""x5""), real-time (>5 Hz), broadband (>10THz), high resolution (<10GHz) THz spectrum analyzer. Development will include several field tests at high power THz sources of interest to the Air Force, and a calibration process will be established to insure robust source classification, regardless of emission mechanism or output power.BENEFIT: The resulting THz spectrum analyzer will be a useful diagnostic tool for new THz sources and as a calibration tool for existing sources.

Currently, the unsteady panel methods still are the major workhorse used by the aerospace industry because these panel methods can generate the Aerodynamic Influence Coefficient (AIC) matrix. The AIC matrix is a multi-input-multi-output aerodynamic transfer function. Because it is an aerodynamic transfer function, the AIC matrix is independent of the structure and only depends on the aerodynamic geometry. Thus, once the aerodynamic configuration is fixed, the AIC matrix can be repeatedly used for structural design. However, because of the linear potential flow assumption, the unsteady panel methods are not valid at transonic Mach numbers. In these flow conditions, accurate unsteady aerodynamic forces can only be obtained by solving the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations.

Once the non-deterministic NSD model is established, the Bayesian-based, data driven, probabilistic LCO prediction tool will have a Ã¢â¬ÅtrueÃ¢â¬ï¿½ LCO predictability of aircraft with stores configurations which can be used to assess, probabilistically, whether the particular stores configuration can be cleared or must be flight tested."

Among them, linearized reduced-order modeling approaches rely on linearization of the nonlinear unsteady aerodynamic flow equations, assuming that the amplitude of the unsteady motion is limited to small perturbations about the nonlinear steady-state flow condition. Various approaches of linearized ROMs, such as Auto-Regressive-Moving-Average (ARMA), first order Volterra Kernel, Impulse Response method, etc., can be broadly found in literature. However, few of them are geared towards the controller design oriented plant modeling, i.e., to obtain a plant model with control surface actuator modeling and gust excitations, and various types of sensor definitions including sectional/component load monitoring capability. In light of this, ZONA proposes to develop a discrete time state-space aeroservoelastic modeling technique with component load monitoring using NASA developed high fidelity Navier-Stokes flow solver, FUN3D. The subspace realization algorithm will be utilized to identify the individual aerodynamic systems, i.e., due to the structural deformations (modal coordinates), control surface deflections and discrete gust, respectively. The dataset needed for the aerodynamic system identifications are obtained by a wrapper program, called OVERFUN, driving the underlying FUN3D solver. OVERFUNâs trim or static aeroelastic analysis solution will provide an initial background solution accounting for static aeroelastic effects. This unique initial flow solution sets the proposed efforts apart from other research work where an initial flow around rigid configurations is normally assumed. Once all three sub aerodynamic system are identified, they are coupled with the structural equation of motion represented in modal space and actuator models to yield the conventional state-space forms of aeroelastic model and plant model."

A fast and accurate aeroelastic prediction is required to identify the critical LCO configurations given the massive number of aircraft with store combinations short-time frame demanded by rapid military responses when facing todays ever-changing international situation. To meet this requirement, a LCO predictive tool based on the ZONA Euler Unsteady Solver (ZEUS) will be developed in Phase I. It will include a Message Passing Interface (MPI) implementation to drastically reduce the computational time of ZEUS. Since many studies have shown that the nonlinear aerodynamics alone is not sufficient to yield LCO, rather LCO is due to both nonlinear aerodynamics and Nonlinear Structural Damping (NSD), a generalized van der Pol NSD model will be incorporated into ZEUS to provide a LCO bounding mechanism in the post flutter flight conditions. The LCO predictive capability of ZEUS with MPI will be demonstrated through benchmark comparisons with flight test data. Prior to the end of Phase I, a prototypical ZEUS with MPI version will be installed in the users computational environment to ensure the compatibility between the ZEUS MPI and the users computational architecture. BENEFIT: LCO is a self-excited, sustained vibration of limited amplitude which can impact a pilots control authority over an aircraft, ride quality, and weapon aiming capability. It can also induce structural fatigue and, under certain circumstances, flutter. The LCO clearance of a modern fighter aircraft should be addressed for all possible store/weapon configurations. Given the drastic number of such configurations, this effort is a major engineering task in aircraft/store weapon compatibility certification.

Several U.S. military aircraft such as F-16, F-15, C-5 and A-10 and commercial aircraft are reaching or are already beyond their originally designed fatigue lives. To identify their residual fatigue life or extend their fatigue life by retrofit, accurate loads spectra to perform fatigue analysis or ground fatigue tests on these aircraft is required. Such an accurate loads spectra can be generated by StS-DFS using the recorded flight test data of individual fleet members of these aircraft as input to keep track of the individual fatigue life as proposed in the USAF Digital Twin vision with the concept of improved fatigue calculation. In Phase II, the ZONA/Boeing team will develop a process that can extract the stresses generated by StS-DFS around the identified fatigue critical regions in the structure and use these stresses as input to their respective structural component damage tolerance models; leading to an updated life prediction and inspection interval of an individual aircraft."

In Phase I, ZONA Technology successfully developed prototype IADS ActiveX controls (i.e., the ZAMS+ Toolset) towards meeting these challenges. In Phase II we propose to mature and extend the ZAMS+ Toolset to establish a simple-to-use, user-friendly, commercially-viable software for the entire IADS flight test community. First, a Windows pre-processing program will be developed to provide a fast and parametrical graphical approach to setup the ZAMS+ 3D surface panel models and all required input for mode shape visualization. Second, the system identification capability of ZAMS+ OMS will be extended with a broadened CDSS method and innovative Physical Modes Selection Algorithm to support real-time flutter predictor capability. The new ZAMS+ OMS will provide both a full user-interactive and automated ""hands free"" approaches towards system identification and flutter prediction. Third, to support Ground Vibration Test (GVT) derived modes, a new data loader will be added for loading and display of GVT derived modes to supplement the current analytical mode capability used for overlaid mode shape correlation. BENEFIT: The proposed research and development effort will enhance flight test control room personnel's capability to obtain: (1) overlaid mode shape correlation of flight test system extracted modes versus analytical or GVT derived modes on 3D surface panel models, (2) the modal participation of the natural modes to the aircraft's aeroelastic response, (3) accurate aeroelastic system frequency and damping to gauge aircraft stability, and (4) flutter/LCO prediction via two flutter prediction approaches.The mode shape correlation display, in conjunction with the aircraft aeroelastic response displayed in the existing ZAMS tool, will help engineers identify how the structure modes interact with the aerodynamics throughout all flight conditions.The commercial potential for ZAMS+ Toolset is great as real-time mode shape identification, accurate system frequency/damping, and flutter prediction capability are crucial data to obtain for all wind tunnel and flight tests.The resulting ZAMS+ toolset will also provide valuable insight into the aero-structure interaction phenomenon that can lead to reduced flight testing. Mode shape correlation can also alleviate costs and burden associated with GVT. Users of these tools will include IADS customers, such as, Edwards AFB, Eglin AFB, Naval Air Weapons Center, Korean Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney, Israeli Air Force, Singapore Air Force, Cessna, Bell Helicopter, Northrop Grumman, Alenia/Italy, General Atomics, Boeing, Gulfstream, Holloman AFB, Raytheon, Hill AFB, and Lockheed."

To this end, the ZONA/MIT team will extend the 2-D ZEUS time-domain unsteady adjoint solver developed in Phase I to 3-D adjoint solver. Also, a structural adjoint method formulated in Phase I will be incorporated in ASTROS to establish a 3-D time-domain ZEUS and ASTROS coupled aero-structure adjoint system. Meanwhile, based on the frequency-domain adjoint solver developed in the ZEUS linearized Euler solver, a frequency-domain flutter sensitivity system will be developed. Both the time-domain and frequency-domain systems will be applied to complex configurations to compare their computational efficiency and accuracy. The 3-D time-domain ZEUS and ASTROS coupled aero-structure adjoint system will be used to perform uncertainty quantification and risk assessment of 3-D wings. Finally, the ZONA/MIT team will incorporate the newly developed least squares sensitivity analysis methodology into the ZEUS code. This new capability will be applied to complex systems involving chaotic aeroelastic oscillations such as a 3-D wing with freeplay and 3-D panel flutter under supersonic/transonic flight conditions. BENEFIT: With performance requirements becoming more stringent and with the need for robust, optimum and cost effective, the designs of the next generation military aircraft are most likely to be non-conventional. Numerous parameters are needed for aircraft descriptions of non-conventional. In order for early identification of critical physical behaviors of those design concepts, response sensitivities with respect to those numerous parameters are required. The proposed adjoint solver can avoid proportional cost growth in sensitivity analysis and efficiently enable rich, parametric aircraft models to be optimized. Once developed, the proposed adjoint solver can be integrated into a multi-disciplinary design analysis and optimization systems as an efficient sensitivity generator for gradient-based optimization involving numerous design parameters.

This capability will allow a continuous simulation of the aircraft in STS-DFS for smoothly varying angle of attack and speed providing aircraft attitude, structural deformations and stresses, as well as accumulated fatigue damage due to buffet loads in additional to maneuver loads and in the entire range of Mach numbers.To achieve the Phase II technical objectives, CFD generated data will be combined with experimental data to build a compact buffet model that is valid for a wide range of angles of attack and speeds. This compact buffet model will be incorporated in STS-DFS to complement its current wide ranging capabilities to further include buffet loads to the aircraft. To address the fatigue life concerns due to buffet loads, a fatigue module will also be added in STS-DFS which builds upon its current stress predictive capabilities. The time histories of these stresses will be processed through a rainflow cycle counting which will provide increments in fatigue damage estimated using one of several accumulation rules broadly used. BENEFIT: The U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Army will benefit from the STS-DFS capabilities to simulate the key aeroelastic coupling mechanism between structural dynamics and nonlinear unsteady aerodynamics, the store ejection, maneuver, gust, and buffet loads, including the effects of uncertainty associated with aircraft-to-aircraft variability. The buffet loads predictive capability will be particularly useful to identify potential fatigue problems on U.S. advanced fighters such as the F-35 and F-22 because both have twin-vertical-tail designs. These twin vertical tails are immersed in the separated flow during high-angle-of-attack maneuvers and suffer from high buffet loads. Application of the STS-DFS to those fighters will permit the fatigue life estimation of their vertical tail structures. Several U.S. military aircraft such as the F-16, F-15, C-5 and A-10 are reaching or are already beyond their originally designed fatigue life. To identify their residual fatigue life or extent their fatigue life by retrofit, accurate loads spectra to perform ground fatigue test on those aircraft are required. To establish such loads spectra, engineers must perform simulations for various mission scenarios that the aircraft may experience during their life cycle. Such loads spectra can be generated by STS-DFS using its broad simulation capabilities for loads generation."

These ROMs are generated from ZEUS, a ZONA's Computational Fluid Dynamic software for aeroelastic simulations. The STS-DFS system has been validated with F/A-18 AAW flight test data and will be further validated with F-15 historical flight test data. In Phase I, the ZONA Team will further develop a store ejection load module to allow the prediction of the dynamic loads and response due to the jettisons of stores. This ejection load module will be validated with available F/A-18 flight test data. Also to be added to the STS-DFS is a nonparametric uncertainty modeling module that will consider aircraft-to-aircraft uncertain variations in their mass and stiffness properties to provide an analysis of the entire fleet not simply of a single aircraft. Application of this uncertainty modeling to the F/A-18 response will be carried out. BENEFIT: As a result of the Phase I effort, the enhanced STS-DFS system will be a high fidelity, multi-disciplinary and real time simulation tool where the aerodynamics, structures, propulsion and control system dynamics are tightly coupled together to provide a virtual flight test capability. It can be employed to accurately predict aircraft loads and stresses for improved fatigue lift and mitigate the cost of solving flight test related problems. It also can be used for control law development, maneuvering flight simulation and handling quality assessment with the inclusion of nonlinear aeroelastic effects. The application of the enhanced STS-DFS system to current and future Air Force vehicles, such as F-22, F-35, Global Hawk, Predator, will lead to a reduction of their respective flight tests necessary for certification. With the current, large customer base of ZONA's commercial software for aeroelastic analyses, ZONA can easily bring the STS-DFS to the aerospace market.

BENEFIT: The proposed research and development effort will enhance flight test control room personnel's capability to gauge the flight test aircraft aeroelastic stability margin and to correlate flight test mode shapes with those computed from finite element analyses. By tracking trends during flight test, this tool can help to predict the onset of large amplitude oscillation that occur during flight (e.g., Limit Cycle Oscillation). For example, tracking of the system damping meter time history during maneuvers can establish thresholds when recorded amplitudes of oscillation exceed pre-determined terminate values. These thresholds can then be used as a predictor gauge during follow-on maneuvers.The mode shape correlation display, in conjunction with the aircraft aeroelastic response displayed in the ZAMS tool, will help identify how the structure modes interact with the aerodynamics throughout all flight conditions. In addition, this tool can be used to validate the finite element analysis model, typically done through expensive Ground Vibration Testing (GVT), by correlating the extracted flight test modes during low speed flight (i.e., where aeroelastic effects on the structure are minimal).Use of the proposed tools will help to minimize aircraft fatigue thereby reducing maintenance costs as well as provide valuable insight into the aero-structure interaction phenomenon that can lead to reduced flight testing. Mode shape correlation can alleviate costs and burden associated with GVT. Users of these tools will include IADS customers, such as, Edwards AFB, Eglin AFB, Naval Air Weapons Center, Korean Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney, Israeli Air Force, Singapore Air Force, Cessna, Bell Helicopter, Northrop Grumman, Alenia/Italy, General Atomics, Boeing, Gulfstream, Holloman AFB, Raytheon, Hill AFB, and Lockheed."

Currently aircrafts with non-adaptive control laws usually include roll-off or notch filters to avoid AE/ASE interactions. However, if changes in the aircraft configuration are significant, the frequencies of the flexible modes of the aircraft may be shifted and the notch filters could become totally ineffective. With the proposed approach, the flexible modes can be consistently estimated in real-time via system identification algorithm. The identified flexible modes information is sought to be injected to the adaptive control algorithm to update a set of pre-chosen basis functions, These are the key elements for the effectiveness of the proposed method. As a result, undesirable effects of elastic modes will be suppressed while the whole system stability being maintained. Two case/analysis scenarios will be considered. First, the feedforward filter topology will be mainly used to reduce any atmospheric induced structural vibration of the aircraft. Second, the adaptive feedback control is triggered to suppress any AE/ASE interactions, and prevent any possible Flutter/Limit Cycle Oscillation (LCO) of the actual flexible aircraft."

Indeed, the computing time for a typical wing flutter/LCO analysis is reduced from hours (direct) to minutes (ROM-ROM).

Scramjet-powered vehicle (SPV) design however enters an unprecedented level of multidisciplinary synergy to achieve its operational requirements. Through a convoluted and inverse design strategy for SPV, its propulsion system inlet design largely dictates the airframe geometry. Further, it is complicated by TPS and aeroelastic requirements. These considerations mandate a drastic paradigm shift from conventional design. Thus a new concept of low-fidelity prediction/high-fidelity correction (LFP/HFC) design/optimization procedure is introduced.

However, the ionization of air occurs at high altitude and high speed, where the rarefaction effects are not negligible.

This reduced order model is constructed using a few eigenmodes of the flow and can capture the complexity of the low-Reynolds number flow structures such as laminar boundary layer separation, transition and reattachment.

Instead of using the spatially fixed Eulerian coordinate system as in most Computional Fluid Dynamics (CFD) computation, the proposed unified coordinates approach is based on a generalized coordinate system which moves with velocity hq with q as the velocity of fluid particles and h as a free function. It includes the Eulerian coordinates approach as a special case when h=0 and the Lagrangian when h=1. Choosing h to preserve grid orthogonality can result in a coordinate system which avoids not only excessive numerical diffusion across slip lines as in the Eulerian coordinates but also severe grid deformation as in the Lagrangian coordinates. Unlike Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach, no remapping from the distorted Lagrangian grid onto the spatially fixed Eulerian grid is required. All computations are done entirely in the transformed space without a staggered grid. More importantly, using the unified coordinates, the computational grid is generated simultaneously by the flow (more precisely by the movement of the pseudo particles) while computing the flow field. Therefore, the computational grid is no longer a required input for CFD computation and gridless CFD computation becomes feasible."

The unique and innovative aspect of this work is to combine both Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) concept and compact differencing into a single upwind algorithm. Instead of using multiple polynomial candidates, a hybrid power-exponential spline is used as the underlying interpolation for a WENO scheme with local smoothness measures as the perturbation parameters. In this way, the weight functions of a WENO scheme can be analytically determined from the underlying interpolation. Their Taylor series expansions around the smooth regions can be used for further accuracy improvement. The resulting piecewise quadratic reconstruction with compact difference computed slope and curvature can dramatically reduce numerical diffusion inherent in upwind schemes. By using this upwind scheme, the numerical simulation of vortex dominated flows, boundary layers, turbulence, acoustic waves, and electromagnetic waves, etc., can be significantly improved without loss of the shock-capturing feature.
The highly accurate reconstruction module, which is independent of physics, can be easily integrated into the current production and research codes and has the potential of providing cost improvement of at least an order of magnitude over the current versions."

Thus, the CKEM canbe controlled effectively in hypersonic/supersonic flight without any control canards. Nor would it require mechanical actuation for hinged bent-nose control. Hence, the merit of the body-flexure PZT control CKEM design lies in its being a simpler systembut with reduced weight and enhanced maneuverability.The proof-of-concept study is overwhelmingly positive in favor of PZT-actuated body flexure control design concept.

We did not believe SPRMs could affect ectopic lesions (endometriosis) if there was no effect on eutopic endometrium.

We established methods and the baseline levels of markers of inflammation in the peritoneal cavity of the monkey. We intend to expand this program in Phase II to determine whether the same compound will reduce the size of endometriosis-like lesions in the same species. This animal model has been shown to respond to both GnRH agonists and to RU 486 with a decrease in lesion size. The use of GnRH agonists in women for the amelioration of endometriosis, although far from ideal, is one of the few medical therapies currently available. The primary outcome parameters will be alterations in the growth of ectopic endometrium and effects on hormones with our lead antiprogestin compound, CDB-4124.

Their potential for use in labor and delivery and in breast cancer remains high. The following document outlines experiments to be performed under Phase II of an SBIR that would clarify the properties of these new SPRMs and enhance their utility for the treatment of endometriosis. It was the intention of Phase I of this SBIR program to determine effects on the eutopic endometrium of cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) following short-term administration, of our lead compound, CDB-4124. We did not believe SPRMs could affect ectopic lesions (endometriosis) if there was no effect on eutopic endometrium. We found that our lead compound had effects on the endometrium similar to RU 486 but without evidence of effects on ovulation and without raising cortisol. We established methods and the baseline levels of markers of inflammation in the peritoneal cavity of the monkey. We intend to expand this program in Phase II to determine whether the same compound will reduce the size of endometriosis-like lesions in the same species. This animal model has been shown to respond to both GnRH agonists and to RU 486 with a decrease in lesion size. The use of GnRH agonists in women for the amelioration of endometriosis, although far from ideal, is one of the few medical therapies currently available. The primary outcome parameters will be alterations in the growth of ectopic endometrium and effects on hormones with our lead antiprogestin compound, CDB-4124. The secondary outcome parameter will be the effects on markers of endometriosis in peritoneal fluid and bone mineral density. The tertiary outcome parameters will be the assessment of the impact of our compound on inflammation markers, on cycling and on liver function."

The following revised proposal outlines experiments to be performed under a SBIR that would clarify the properties of certain new antiprogestins as adjuvant therapies analogous to current therapies utilizing tamoxifen and SERMs. In May 1999, a Licensing Agreement between Zonagen and the NICHD was finalized to develop new antiprogestins. We expect that the new generation of compounds will be used for a number of indications where the etiology is dominated by progesterone. The promise of the first antiprogestin, RU 486, has gone unfulfilled because of its extensive antiglucocorticoid effects and the political backlash to its use as an abortifacient. Indications for antiprogestin use could include oral contraception, labor induction, cervical ripening, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and treatment of uterine fibroids, endometriosis, and especially breast cancer. It is the overall aim of this proposed SBIR to determine effects on the growth of previously established rodent breast cancers with the ultimate intention of introducing a new adjuvant treatment for human breast cancer. The rat model has been shown to respond to antiprogestins such as RU 486 with a decrease in the growth of lesions following treatment. There is a need to determine whether our lead compound. CDB-4124, has the same anticancer properties as RU 486 as a proof-of-principle. Moreover, we need to determine the dose-response of that lead compound. Phase II would determine whether a secondary class of compounds have similar activity, whether the best compound(s) reduce the ultimate size and appearance of lesions if used prior to frank appearance, and their synergism with antiestrogens. Additionally, the possibility that antiprogestins can inhibit breast tumor growth and development would greatly enhance the potential of such compounds for chemoprevention and other long-term therapies (fibroids, endometriosis, HRT) and such a drug should find wide and unqualified acceptance among women."

Alum is the only adjuvant widely licensed for human use and is reported as stimulating effective T-helper cell type 2 (Th-2) like responses. Th-2 responses are typified by production of predominately IgG1, IgE and the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-10. In contrast adjuvants such as Complete Freund?s adjuvant, stimulate strong antibody responses with a preponderance of IgG2a. This type of response is indicative of a Th-1 response and is associated with the presence of cell mediated immunity, delayed type hypersensitivity, induction of complement fixing and IgA antibodies and the cytokines IFN-gamma, IL-2 and IL-12. Desired adjuvants, especially for poorly immunogenic, subunit, recombinant protein and synthetic peptide and carbohydrate antigens, are those capable of stimulating Th-1 immune responses. In this study we will characterize the cytokine and specific antibody response using a new adjuvant developed at Zonagen. We believe this adjuvant, which was developed to combine the unique immune modulating properties of chitosan and zinc, will have several advantages in the preparation of vaccines. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Products, such as improved adjuvants, that will enhance the immune response to poorly immunogenic antigens, should be widely received and commercially profitable."

Such products would significantly enhance the educational and vocational opportunities of the blind. The Phase I research objectives include evaluating 3x3 tactile actuator matrices to determine their suitability for expansion to: a) a 36x12 matrix in a dynamic vibratory mode; and b) a full page Braille display in a static mode. Additional objectives will include determining how this technology can be incorporated in products for blind people that provide access to text documents, graphs, maps, Internet, email, screen displays. The research will involve building and testing tactile stimulator arrays in vibratory and static modes to determine the: 1) capability to support the required amplitudes and forces; 2) dynamic power consumption; 3) required voltages; 4) scalability to the desired matrix size; and 5) manufactureability including cost and automation. The feasibility of high voltage drivers, and the incorporation of other components into the desired package will also be researched. The anticipated results will determine the feasibility of these revolutionary tactile display products for the blind.
The broader impacts/commercial potential of the research is based on providing technology that uses the sense of touch to substitute for, or to augment, vision and hearing. The most effective tactile display has been that in the Optacon, which consisted of a 24x6 array of piezoelectric reeds. Including the pins that contacted the finger, this array had 288 hand-assembled discrete components and 432 hand-wired solder joints on 6 overlapping planes. The result was an expensive to build display that consumed considerable space. EPAM technology promises to reduce the discrete components to a single monolithic polymeric sheet with individually addressable patterned areas, so cost and space are reduced while greatly improving manufactureability. Market segments for blindness products are schools and universities, state departments of rehabilitation, corporations, government agencies, private organizations, and individuals. A goal is to improve the potential commercial value in the blindness field by reducing the price so the individual market segment is larger. The societal impact in the blindness field would be in their increased employment and independence. The research would enhance scientific and technological understanding in the capabilities of the human sense of touch and how to build systems that effectively use it."

The project goal is to develop a non irritating treatment for cystinosis induced corneal cystine crystal
accumulation that can be administered approximately every  hours Cystinosis is a rare genetic lysosomal
storage disease characterized by the abnormal accumulation of cystine crystals in multiple organs including
the cornea The cystine crystals result in organ damage and in the eye if untreated result in blindness
Cystinosis is treated with oral administered cysteamine bitartrate This mobilizes cystine by formation of a
mixed disulfide between cysteamine and cysteine that is transported from the cell from most organs except the
cornea Ocular manifestations of Cystinosis are treated by hourly administration of an eye drop formulation of
cysteamine Cystaran  The drops cause significant pain and irritation upon placing in the eye The discomfort
from Cystaran results in non compliance which for some patients leads to corneal damage disease
progression and blindness The irritation is caused by the low pH  in Cystaran required to stabilize
cysteamine against oxidation
 We have engineered a novel liposome formulation of cysteamine that stabilizes the drug that is inside
the liposome during storage has a pH between  and  and predictably releases a therapeutically effective
portion of cysteamine from the liposome as soon as it is applied to the eye The remainder of the applied dose
that adheres to the cul de sac in the eye is designed to be released in a sustained manner This approach
exploits the capability of the nanocompartment of the liposome to have a different internal environment than
the solution outside of the liposome The approach can be used for other liable compounds that are applied as
eye drops or topical solutions The Specific Aims of this project are to Optimize the formulation for burst
release followed by a sustained release Establish the near termmonth stability of the optimized
liposomal cysteamine formulation s  Determine the extent of irritation of the optimized formulations in an
appropriate animal model Successful completion of the project could result in a liposomal cysteamine eye

However, the body cannot efficiently remove iron hence theextra iron in the transfused blood accumulates. This causes a toxic build up in the blood, saturation of the iron storage proteins in the liver and spleen leading to iron-induced liver disease, endocrine disorders and cardiomyopathy. If left untreated, iron induced cardiomyopathy inevitably leads to death, before the child reaches adulthood. Transfusional iron overload can be treated by chelation. Approved iron chelators suffer from severe drawbacks that we aim to overcome with a targeted chelator deliverystrategy. We have devised a novel, stable nanoliposome (LDFO) formulation containing a high concentration of the iron chelator desferroxamine (DFO). We will test the hypothesis that the subcutaneous (SC) administration of the novel LDFO results in a therapeutic DFO concentration in the liver and spleen and a sustained level of DFO in the blood. Three specific aims will be completed: In aim 1, we will optimize the Liposomal-DFO formulation. In aim 2, we will establish the Storage Stability of the Liposomal DFO Formulations. In aim 3 we will determine the liposomal DFO pharmacokinetics and biodistribution profile when administered by I.V. and subcutaneous routes. This targeted delivery of DFO to the main iron storage sites in the body will more effectively remove iron from deep tissue sites than infusion of non-encapsulated DFO, will infuse 1/8th of the currently used DFO dose in 1/40th of the current infusion time. The formulation will be easier and safer to administer than Desferal(R). If LDFO is validated,it would be a significant advance for the clinical treatment of transfusional iron overload in pediatric patients.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Twice-Weekly Subcutaneous Liposome Chelator to Treat Transfusional Iron Overload Project Relevance We have packaged the iron chelator desferroxamine in nanovesicles, known as liposomes, that can be administered subcutaneously to treat pediatric thalassemia and sickle cell anemia patients for transfusional iron overload. The nanoliposome-desferroxamine can be administered at 1/8th of the currently used desferroxamine dose; in 1/40th of the current infusion time. This novel treatment is more effective for removing iron from the liver or spleen, more convenient and should be safer inpediatric patients resulting in substantial benefits for both the patients and their parents."

This is particularly true for experimental validation where spectroscopy and microscopy- based data is required at the nanoscale. Electron microscopy has an advantage of being able to collect multiple types of signals at the same time with high spatial resolution and therefore, large amounts of useful data can be collected if electron microscopy can be successfully automated. Unfortunately, this automation is difficult because of lack of a common standardized platform for controlling the electron microscope and data acquisition. This is because the manufacturers of the electron microscopes, various cameras and detectors and spectrometers use different, proprietary software that are difficult to synchronize for efficient and automated collection of imaging, diffraction and chemical data. Many necessary processes for acquiring atomic resolution images and diffraction patterns such as tilting of samples are still performed manually, slowing down the process of materials discovery and understanding of various physical phenomena. Our vision is to have an open-source platform with a user-friendly graphic user interface for control and data acquisition that can be used on electron microscopes from all the manufacturers, whereby users would be able to develop and customize different modules for efficiently acquiring different types of data such as imaging, diffraction, chemical and even information from dynamic or operando experiments. Over the last decade, open-source Python-based programs have become widely popular among scientists involved in scientific instrumentation. We propose to use Nion Swift, an open software that integrates hardware control, data acquisition, visualization, processing, and analysis and extend its capabilities by adding capabilities such as automated tilting of crystalline samples, automated acquisition of images for tomography and automated diffraction mapping. During phase 1 of the project, we plan to develop open-source programs to automate i) tilting and manipulation of samples, ii) acquisition of images for tomography, iii) diffraction mapping and test these programs on electron microscopes. Since the call is for developing an open-source program, we do not expect sales from this development. However, the user experience and the integration of the software with hardware would help in sales of our electron microscopy accessories such as in situ sample holder for the electron microscopes."

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder marked by inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Stimulant therapies can be effective for alleviating ADHD symptoms; however, due to neurobiological heterogeneity of ADHD, some patients are non-responders, or develop undesirable side effects. This creates a process of trial-and-error in the clinical pursuit of alternative treatment options. Currently there are no widely utilized laboratory tests that measure clinically actionable neuroendocrine analytes in ADHD that can provide adequate prediction of treatment success and remission. This project will develop a companion diagnostic for ADHD to complement existing symptom evaluation questionnaires, which are indirect measures of treatment outcome. The proposed companion diagnostic encompasses developing a clinical test for neuroendocrine molecules â GABA, allopregnanolone, glutamate, serotonin and kynurenine analyzed in dried blood spot (DBS) due to its minimally-invasive nature. We will use pre-existing whole blood samples from children with ADHD collected as part of an active randomized control trial by a team of academic collaborators at Oregon Health andamp; Science University to evaluate and confirm dysregulated neuroendocrine tone in ADHD. Specific aims: 1. A) Develop and validate an analytical assay for GABA and allopregnanolone in DBS. We will determine analytical parameters, including linearity, recovery, precision, etc., and confirm accuracy by comparing DBS to liquid blood analysis, which is the currently accepted gold standard method. 1. B) Incorporate glutamate, serotonin and kynurenine analytes for simultaneous analysis. 2. Evaluate the performance of the clinical test using DBS samples from medication-free pediatric patients with ADHD.Completion of these aims will serve as proof-of-concept for a fully validated DBS test for baseline (no treatment) levels of GABA, allopregnanolone, glutamate, serotonin and kynurenine in ADHD. This will establish the basis for Phase II, developing a comprehensive clinical study that will examine the changes in neuroendocrine parameters in response to stimulants, non-stimulants and nutritional supplements used in ADHD.Project Narrative
This project will develop a clinical test to serve as a companion diagnostic to measure neuroendocrine molecules relevant to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

This Direct to Phase II Small Business Innovation Research project will further the development of
Zip-stitch, a patented surgical wound closure system for internal surgical incisions. The Zip-stitch system
has been developed specifically for laparoscopic hysterectomy to address two key problems in vaginal
cuff closure: (1) the technical difficulty of laparoscopic suturing and (2) vaginal cuff dehiscence or wound
separation. The Zip-stitch system is comprised of a series of bioabsorbable clips deployed by an
applicator tool onto opposing edges of the vaginal cuff wound. Clips are applied with sufficient pressure
to achieve hemostasis without piercing tissue and lead to wound healing.
This proposal for the clinical validation and development of the Zip-stitch system is responsive to one of
the stated research goals of the Gynecologic Health and Disease Branch (GHDB) of NICHD: âDevices
and/or technologies designed to address surgical challenges in gynecologic surgeries, including
hysterectomy.â To this end, Zip-stitch improves the most challenging step in minimally invasive
hysterectomy, making cuff closure easier and faster, and healing better. This Phase II research proposal
builds on successful results from benchtop, animal study and pilot clinical study evaluations. The
objectives of this proposal are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Zip-stitch in a clinical setting and to
prepare the applicator for commercialization. This will be accomplished by means of a 59-patient clinical
study and engineering design refinement, including prototyping and benchtop testing.
The Phase II Technical Objectives are:1. Evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Zip-stich in a clinical setting;2. Determine priorities for Zip-stitch Applicator improvements; and3. Re-design the Zip-stitch Reusable Applicator user interface.
This project is part of a broader plan to develop, validate, and market the Zip-stitch System across a
broad spectrum of minimally-invasive surgeries involving internal incisions. These markets represent
more than 6 million surgeries per year in the U.S., creating a domestic market potential of more than
$2.5 billion for the Zip-stitch platform of closure devices. Initially, the Zip-stitch system directly
addresses a specific unmet clinical need in laparoscopic hysterectomy. There are approximately
500,000 minimally-invasive hysterectomies performed in the U.S. each year, representing an annual
addressable domestic market size for Zip-stitch of $300 MM.Project Narrative
This project develops and evaluates Zip-Stitch, a patented system for closing internal surgical incisions
with initial application in laparoscopic hysterectomy. Compared to sutures (the standard of care),
Zip-stitch is faster and easier for the surgeon to apply, can lead to better healing, and save hospitals
money. Completion of the proposed clinical validation and device refinement significantly advances
Zip-stitch towards market entry in its initial application."

This technology has particular value in the rapidly-growing minimally-invasive surgery market, in which internal closure is made difficult by the small size of superficial incisions. These markets represent more than 6 million surgeries per year in the U.S., creating a domestic market potential of more than $2.5 billion for the platform of closure devices under development. Initially, the system directly addresses a specific unmet clinical need: reducing both the technical demands of internal closure during minimally-invasive hysterectomy and the significant complications associated with the use of sutures in this procedure. There were approximately 420,000 of these surgeries performed in the U.S. in 2013, representing more two-thirds of all U.S. hysterectomies. This fraction of hysterectomies performed in this manner is continuing to grow, and will represent a total annual addressable domestic market size at peak sales of $200 MM ($600 MM globally). The proposed project develops a novel surgical closure system for closing internal incisions in endoscopy. Our initial application is in laparoscopic (minimally-invasive) hysterectomy. Sutures are typically used to close internal incisions in laparoscopic surgery. Throwing loops and tying knots are among the most difficult parts of laparoscopic procedures; these difficulties have slowed the adoption of laparoscopic hysterectomy. In Phase II, the Technical Objectives are (1) to refine the closure system to meet the requirements of a minimum viable product; (2) to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the system in a large animal model of laparoscopic hysterectomy; and (3) to demonstrate efficacy of the system in laparoscopic hysterectomy in a cadaveric model. These objectives are designed to complete the evaluation of the performance of this novel closure system against product requirements identified by the surgical community and utilized in the design process."

Description of Effort: Based on the feasibility research conducted during Phase I, Phase II will focus on optimizing the optical properties of GRIN-ARTM coatings deposited by RIR-MAPLE, optimizing the synthesis of hybrid organic/inorganic polymeric materials, enabling GRIN-ARTM coating deposition on flexible substrates, and translating optimized processes to commercial-scale production.

The synthesis of custom hybrid organic/inorganic polymeric materials is a second benefit that enables both refractive index control and improved durability. The successful demonstration of the proposed conformal hybrid organic/inorganic GRIN-ARTM structure deposited using RIR-MAPLE will enable environmentally durable, UV-protected, anti-reflection coatings for military and commercial applications such as wearable electronics, protective eye wear, and energy efficient light weight solar control coatings.

The precise control of RIR-MAPLE based film deposition is perfectly suited for GRIN-AR formation since it will allow for the discrete deposition of multi-component hybrid nanocomposites while varying the composition to achieve a GRIN film. The resulting GRIN-AR structure can have the desired reflection of less than 0.5% over the wavelength range of interest (400-750nm) for wide incident angles, with proper control of the index profile.

Surface textures are mandatory to record efficiencies in solar cells. The Omni-Directional Antireflective Coating (Omni-AR) solution showed a reduction in reflection in a large range of incident angles (omni-directional) over a broad spectral range (400-1200 nm). Improved solar cell efficiency of over 10% was demonstrated (experimentally). The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be a low-cost, broad-spectrum, omni-directional and substrate-independent surface texture antireflective coating. It is expected to have a significant impact on current and future solar cell technologies. The ability to provide near ideal performance of antireflective coatings to solar cells without a vacuum process is a major step in reducing the cost of solar electricity. This solution-based deposition technique makes it possible to provide a single coating technology that should work with all types of solar cell materials and structures. This project will significantly improve the conversion efficiency in both current and future solar cells (~10%) with a minimum cost increase (~4%).

The coating consists of a monolayer of microscale silica particles partially immersed into a film of spin-on glass. Its antireflection is broad spectrum and less dependent on sunlight incident angle, thus omni-directional. More importantly, the coating is prepared from solutions, ensuring its low cost. The research activities include 1) development of coating processes which allow large-area, uniform and close-packed coating of solar cells with monolayer silica particles; 2) optical simulation to optimize the designs of Omni-AR coatings and 3) testing of commercial polycrystalline silicon solar cells with Omni-AR coatings. Except anisotropically-etched pyramids on single-crystalline silicon, there is currently no cost effective method to produce surface texture on any other types of solar cells. Through this project, the technical feasibility and commercial potential of Omni-AR will be demonstrated. Such a low-cost, broad-spectrum, omni-directional and substrate-independent AR coating will have a significant impact on current and future solar cell technologies, including polycrystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, ribbon silicon, copper indium diselenide, cadmium telluride and organic semiconductors, by significantly improving their efficiency with a minimum cost increase.

Fucosylated oligosaccharides in the cell are involved in various types of biochemical recognition processes and in microbial infections, toxin entry, and cancer cells metastasis.These properties make these carbohydrates valuable for pharmaceutical and drug discovery needs but current production methods production is very expensive and impractical. Most notably is the expense and difficulty in producing the activated sugar, GDP-fucose. Current methods described to date for the production of GDP-fucose using chemoenzymatic synthesis, or modified microorganisms such E. coli and S. cerevisiae all either yield too small quantities of material or are overly complicated and can't be scaled. Here we propose to develop an entirely new system based on the use of a yeast system for production GDP-fucose. This system uses a strong inducible promoter for overexpression of the enzyme from a de novo pathway in methylotrophic yeast. These yeast naturally produce a high yield of GDP-mannose which the proposed system will convert to GDP-fucose and utilize nucleotide-sugar transporter for extracellular release. We foresee the advantages of this approach to be high- level expression of protein involved to GDP-fucose synthesis and transport and the possibility to use the desired enzymes for in vivo synthesis. In Phase I we will test the feasibility of developing this system by screening a set of yeast that can produce GDP-mannose in highest yield, overexpress the enzymes necessary to convert GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose, and test the ability to produce GDP-L-fucose. We will then test the ability to transport GDP-L- fucose out of the cell and determine the initial conditios for fermentation. In Phase II wewill further engineer and optimize the production of GDP-fucose and demonstrate its utility by testing the production of several human milk from starting materials that are readily available to us. Finally, Phase III commercialization will involve sellngGDP-fucose, licensing the system for use by a variety of companies, and in using it to produce custom fucosylated oligosaccharides, small molecules, and proteins.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of the yeast gene expression system proposed here will allow production of GDP-fucose in vivo at a large scale. This technology will make this sugar nucleotide available in low price for modification of already synthesized or natural sugar, lipids, proteins, antibiotics andvaccines. The proposed research has the potential to open up several multi-billion dollar markets in anti-infective and anticancer therapeutics."

These specialized activated hexoses are found as important structural components throughout plant and microbial secondary metabolites often playing a crucial role in conferring activity in bioactive natural products such as antibiotics and anticancer therapeutics. We propose to investigate a novel approach to produce rare TDP-deoxysugars in Escherichia coli through metabolic engineering. By combining genetic mutations which separately lead to increased bioavailability of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P; an intermediate of TKDG) and TDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose (TKDG; an intermediate of TDP-deoxysugars) we plan to increase the accumulation of the TKDG precursor beyond previous reports. Additional over-expression of endogenous TKDG biosynthetic proteins mayfurther optimize TKDG production. Finally, exogenous TDP-deoxysugar biosynthetic genes will be introduced into the strain to convert the accumulated TKDG pool into specific TDP-deoxysugars. Specifically, in Phase I we will demonstrate the feasibility of TDP-deoxysugar production in E. coli through by 1) developing analytical methods for the isolation, purification and characterization of TDP-deoxysugars produced by E. coli, 2) metabolically engineering E. coli to accumulate the TKDG and, 3) demonstrating the utility of the resulting TKDG over-producing strain by producing various TDP-deoxysugars. Specifically, biosynthetic genes responsible for the individual production of TDP-D- fucose, TDP-D-fucofuranose and TDP-D-olivose will be placed into inducible E.coli expression vectors and transformed into the engineered strain accumulating TKDG. We propose the resulting strains will be capable of producing at least 50 mg/L of TDP-D-fucose, TDP-D-fucofuranose and/or TDP-D-olivose in the Phase I study. In Phase II, we will scale-up production of TDP-deoxysugars and optimize chromatographic techniques for increased throughput. Furthermore, we will continue to utilize various TDP-deoxysugar biosynthetic genes for the production of amino sugars, branched-chain sugarsand additional deoxysugars. In Phase III we will commercialize the technology developed by offering a wide variety of TDP-sugars for sale, carrying out custom synthesis of TDP-sugars, and carrying out custom glycodiversification projects.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is aimed toward developing E. coli as a whole-cell biocatalyst for the production of activated TDP-deoxysugars.

The broader impact/commercial potential of the project will be to further biodiesel as a replacement for petrochemical diesel. Converting the main by-product of biodiesel production, glycerol, to a value-added product would improve the economics of biodiesel, while removing a waste stream and providing a reduction in price of the co-product. Xylitol itself also has beneficial societal impacts including anti-carcinogenic effects as a safe sweetener for diabetics, and it does not promote new cases of diabetes as some sweeteners are suspected of doing."

By converting crude glycerol to a value-added coproduct there will be significant improvement in biodiesel production economics. Xylitol has health benefits as a low calorie sweetener and anticariogenic agent, but its use is limited by high cost due to limited availability of d-xylose, the feedstock for current manufacturing methods. Phase I will assess the feasibility of engineering E. coli to produce xylitol from glycerol. By starting with a strain capable of converting glycerol to d-xylulose-5-phosphate and d-xylulose to xylitol, the ability to convert glycerol to xylitol hinges on a single enzyme a phosphatase to bridge the gap. Phosphatases will be tested and identified, and the ability to engineer the system will be demonstrated. Phase II will focus on developing an optimized commercial process. The broader impacts of this research will be to enchance the viability of biodiesel production processes while enhancing the supply of a critical sweetener. First, creating better economics for the production of biodiesel will result in a more competitive process, thus reducing our reliance on foreign oil, creating new market opportunities for the US agricultural industry, and reducing pollution and carbon footprint. Second, such a process would relieve the production bottleneck for xylitol which is beneficial to oral health, allowing the US market for xylitol to expand. Finally, the process will provide a springboard for conversion of glycerol to generally more valuable 5-carbon sugar-based molecules."

Natural product glycosylation is vital for the discovery of new pharmaceutical compounds.

One of the challenges is that the modified and rare sugars needed for creating diversity are unavailable or extremely difficult to make, and that the sugars need to be chemically activated in order to transfer them to the core natural product molecule. However, new technology has been developed where a chemoenzymatic method is used to attach sugars to natural production aglycons. With this method, a combination of a kinase and nucleotide transferase are needed to form the specific activated sugar and finally a glycosyltransferase is used to transfer the sugar to an appropriate aglycon core. This technology is valuable for drug discovery, as it can be used to produce a library of differentially glycosylated natural product molecules. The Phase II research of this project will continue the improvements in the enzymes needed for this process, including engineering a greater substrate range.

If these byproducts, which are rich in sugars, could be made into a valuable product, the cost-effectiveness of ethanol production will be enhanced. One such potential product is xylitol, a five-carbon polyalcohol that has gained acceptance as a natural food sweetener that can replace sucrose on a weight-for-weight basis. Although xylitol is in high demand by the food ingredient and confectionary industries, its use currently is constrained by the limited supply of raw materials. This project will develop a bioprocess to transform waste sugars into xylitol, thereby improving the economics of ethanol production. In Phase I, bacterial host strains were developed for the transformation of these waste sugars. In addition, the various feedstocks that would feed the bioprocess were evaluated, several prototype bioconversion systems were assembled and tested, and some preliminary metabolic engineering was performed to demonstrate feasibility. Phase II will involve further metabolic engineering, fine-tuning of the fermentation process, and scaling-up the process to commercial levels. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee: The new bioprocess should significantly reduce the cost of commercial xylitol production, free xylitol production from the current raw-material-availability constraints, and have a positive impact on the economics of fuel ethanol production. Moreover, domestic firms would be able to produce xylitol more cheaply, thereby avoiding the need to relocate manufacturing facilities to Southeast Asia. Finally, the new bioprocess should be inherently cleaner and safer than the existing hydrogenation process for xylitol."

This difficulty is exacerbated by the lack of easily available of starting materials created with rare sugars. One such sugar is L-ribose. L-ribose is the core of several nucleoside- based pharmaceuticals presently on the market or undergoing clinical trials. As the need for these drugs increases, demand for L-ribose is going to increase significantly. We propose a fermentative route to the production of L-ribose and other rare sugars using a mannitol-1- dehydrogenase (MDH). The MDH has a broad substrate specificity profile that allows the production of many different rare sugars from readily available and inexpensive polyols. Phase I of this research dealt with the recombinant expression of the MDH gene within Escherichia coli and demonstrated the synthetic utility of the system with L-ribose being our initial target. This phase II portion will expand upon the successful phase I research to study the scale-up of these conversions into a commercially viable process as well as the engineering of the MDH to expand the synthetic utility of the enzyme beyond the substrate specificity of the wild-type MDH. Specifically, we intend to 1) improve the expression and activity the mannitol dehydrogenase, 2) scale-up the L-ribose production, 3) test and scale-up in vitro bioconversion and/or fermentations of other rare sugars, 4) improve the NADH oxidase for cofactor recycling, and 5) modify the substrate specificity of the mannitol dehydrogenase. This technology will create a diversity of low-cost rare sugars to expand the portfolio of carbohydrate starting materials available to biochemists and medicinal chemists. Rare sugars are becoming increasingly important in the development of therapeutics, whether for attachment to natural products, or as the building blocks for nucleoside-based antivirals. Many of these rare sugars, such as L-ribose or D-mannose, are simply not available in large quantities for biochemical and pharmaceutical studies. Our work will create a portfolio of low- cost sugars that will enable the production of a wide variety of carbohydrate-based therapeutics for drug discovery."

The clinical relevance of such compounds stems from the sharp rise in VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and more recently staphylococci) infections from below 0.5% in 1989 to >30% in 2000 in U.S. alone. This rise in vancomycin-resistant organisms is causing a serious public health problem, making it extremely difficult to treat infections, and also increasing the risk of patients acquiring infections while in a hospital. New compounds need to be developed in order to overcome this problem. Modification of the attached carbohydrates in the vancomycin molecule has proven to be key to overcoming the mechanisms of resistance in microbes. Yet, the number of available carbohydrate-modified vancomycin analogs is limited by the synthetic complexity of the parent glycopeptide natural product. Neoglycorandomization is a robust chemical method for one step sugar ligation which does not require any prior sugar protection or activation. This method is anticipated to provide a clear advantage in the discovery of new vancomycin-based therapeutics. In this work we will synthesize two types of neoglycoside glycopeptide prototype molecules, one targeting VanA resistance, and the other, VanB resistance. These molecules will be subjected to screening for effectiveness. With the dramatic increase in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant bacterial infections, there is a critical need for new antibacterial therapeutics. Our work uses a unique technology to create novel derivatives of vancomycin by attaching sugars to the core molecule of the natural product, and will be specially designed to overcome resistant strains."

One such carbohydrate is L-ribose. L-Ribose is used in many different applications, including several nucleoside-based Pharmaceuticals presently available or undergoing clinical trials. As the need for these drugs increases, demand for L-ribose is going to increase significantly. This proposal outlines a new synthetic route to L-ribose production, which will result in lower-cost of manufacture than the current state-of-the-art. The technologies developed for the L-ribose production can then be translated into the production of other rare sugars to expand the portfolio of carbohydrate starting materials available to biochemists and synthetic carbohydrate chemists. The proposed route to L-ribose utilizes an enzymatic process. To achieve large-scale production of L-ribose a eukaryotic gene will be synthetically constructed to express in a microbial host. Initially, Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae will be tested as a suitable production system. This synthetic route has several potential advantages over the current commercial routes by using a single-step fermentation from a readily available starting material. Phase I of this proposal would study the gene expression within a heterologous expression strain. The goal of the phase I portion of the proposal is to produce an active gene within an expression host and improve the activity with directed evolution. The specific aims of this Phase I grant are 1) to construct and express the specific gene; 2) Assay development; and 3) Preliminary engineering of enzyme activity. By developing this advanced production of rare sugars used by the pharmaceutical industry and other research institutions, the public will have access to better and cheaper treatments for disease."

X-ray mammography (XRM) has recognized limits including relatively high false negative rates. Other disadvantages include uncomfortable breast compression (possibly reducing participation rates), relatively high dose to the breast, and low positive predictive value, especially for radiographically dense breasts, and 2D images having severely overlapped tissues. The emergence of compact, high-quality digital X-ray imaging detectors, together with nearly exponential growth in computing power and corresponding price reductions, allows for the natural evolution of fully-3D dedicated breast imaging. The contemporary breast imaging approach using tomosynthesis yields morphological, pseudo-3D images (asymmetric volume image resolution with highly aliased and blurred artifacts) and with otherwise no quantifiable metrics due to the highly insufficiently sampled breast volume. The fully-3D dedicated breast Computed mammoTomography (CmT) solution we are developing has the potential for improved detection of breast lesions through the removal of contrast-reducing overlying tissue with images having lt500 micron isotropic resolution, as well as the added benefits of uncompressed breast imaging for greater patient comfort, and breast dose equal to or less than that of current dual view screening mammography. Since it is well known that breast compression affects flow of contrast agents, immobilized but uncompressed breast CmT imaging proposed here also allows for contrast enhanced and other kinetic based studies. Ultimately, we expect this technology to result in improved positive predictive value with earlier cancer detection and reduced morbidity and mortality. In NCI-funded work, all Aims have been accomplished in the Phase I SBIR, and we have confirmed that the next generation scanner will be able to fully image the breast and chest wall of a prone patient with uncompressed breasts without unnecessary and uncomfortable contortions of the patient. Our findings have indicated that a unique combination of complex motion capabilities together with modified system and bed components are required to meet this end. As far as we know, this will represent the first dedicated breast CT system with these capabilities and solves one of the major issues remaining for this technology to be commercially successful, namely the ability to image the full breast and chest wall, in a short period of time, without moving the patient during the scan, and maximizing patient comfort. Therefore, the main goals of this Phase II proposal will be to fabricate a clinic-ready scanner containing all modifications indicated in the Phase I and to perform clinical evaluations of this scanner with a small cohort of patients. These goals will be approached through the following Phase II Specific Aims over a two-year period: Specific Aim 1 is to fabricate a clinic-ready scanner using the results of the Phase I SBIR. Tasks will include: (1) implementation of new larger Varian 4030E detector and end-on Comet X-ray tube; (2) implementation of redesigned patient bed specifically adapted to the new system; and (3) implementation and automation of unique orbits and vertical motion capability of system determined in Phase I to maximize the breast volume scanned. Specific Aim 2 is to upgrade front-end and back-end software systems, including (1) implementation of improved synchronization and software robustness to FDA standards; (2) implementation of improved reconstruction algorithm for faster and more practical reconstructions; (3) implementation of front-end GUI for use by trained technician; (4) automation of back-end process for reconstructions and data presentation; and (5) inclusion of literature based scatter correction. Specific Aim 3 is to perform a limited patient trial with a cohort of 25 locally advanced breast cancer patients for three purposes: (1) evaluation of a developed simple mechanism for uncompressed breast immobilization and biopsy capability; (2) evaluation of modified system on women of varying breast and body sizes to confirm system flexibility and ability to image to chest wall; (3) comparison study of CmT versus digital x-ray mammography where patients will undergo both scans. Criteria for success for each Aim are defined in the more detailed Specific Aims section of the proposal. Therefore, the primary goal of this proposal is to produce a clinic-ready and saleable next generation system suitable for placement in practicing clinics to be used for collection of clinical trial results suitable for FDA submission and subsequent sale of systems for commercial use. These systems will be, to our knowledge, the only dedicated breast CT systems with the complex motion capabilities necessary for comfortable and complete breast, and also capable of chest wall imaging. Overall success of this project will be indicated by a complete system useable by trained technicians in a clinical setting and the indication from initial patient trials that the system measures up to the anticipated advantages that have been indicated by our previous results. Phase III is anticipated to involve production of several commercially viable products for placement in several clinics for larger patient trials. The sampling techniques developed here could also be packaged as products in their own right. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This R44 proposal seeks Phase II funding to produce a clinic-ready, commercially viable, next generation dedicated 3D breast CT device and conduct initial patient trials to evaluate the ability of the system to image breast cancers as compared with conventional digital mammography. In the USA, breast cancer in women is one of the leading causes of malignancy and the second leading cause of death due to cancer (after lung cancer). The earlier a lesion is detected, the better the chances for survival. Our primary hypothesis has been that a dedicated device for 3-dimensional, uncompressed, whole breast imaging will significantly improve cancer detection, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality. Preliminary results have indicated a significant potential advantage and therefore indicate that 3D breast CT should play a prominent role as an important tool in a clinical setting for mammographers. This project serves to provide a clinic-ready scanner able to comfortably image the entire breast without breast compression along with the chest wall of a prone patient, overcoming a major challenge for dedicated breast imaging, and to provide initial patient results confirming patient benefits and therefore commercial potential. Subsequent Phase III activities will involve production of several systems for placement in multiple clinics and conduction of further clinical trials for FDA approval. Academic research markets will also be approached for sale of additional units."

Ultimately, we expect this technology to result in improved positive predictive value with earlier cancer detection and reduced morbidity and mortality. In the long term, we seek to demonstrate the feasibility of this device in a clinical setting by overcoming the current limitations in imaging the full breast volume and chest wall. These physical limitations are currently imposed by the fact that the X-ray tube and detector must trace an orbital path which includes moving under a patient support. For other ""standard"" designs, this makes it difficult to image close to the chest wall, though our prototype device has the 3-dimensional positioning capability to potentially overcome some of these limitations. Specific Aim 1 will investigate of partial angle tomographic scanning using the patient bed to move the breast further into the field of view to capture the entire breast and chest wall while limiting the orbit of the device to the sides of the bed. The assembly will be placed under a patient bed at the Multi-Modality Imaging Lab (MMIL) at Duke University Medical Center and partial angle scans made of available torso, breast, and lesion phantoms. Observers will determine the extent of visibility of lesions close to the chest wall. Specific Aim 2 will demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing current patient bed vertical elevation capabilities to change the relationship between breast and system center of rotation during scans to provide full 360 degree acquisitions while avoiding patient bed limitations. A patient bed with multiple degrees of freedom of movement will be used to lower the patient phantom further into the field of view while the device is perpendicular to the bed axis, then raise the bed to allow to device to move under the bed. Results will be evaluated as in Specific Aim 1. Specific Aim 3 will model patient bed designs to determine the degree to which the chest wall can be moved into the field of view with reasonable patient comfort by potentially utilizing smooth bed contours around a patient's hips and head. Successful implementation of the above alternatives, pending results of Phase I, will result in a next generation advanced system being produced in Phase II that can be placed in a clinical setting for the beginning of patient studies, leading to a commercially available product."

Industrial activity in the U.S. produces more than 25 billion gallons of wastewater every day, much of contaminated with oils, greases, solvents, and other harmful chemical compounds. Existing filtration membranes are easily clogged and damaged by these oily materials, suffering a rapid decline in performance. Safely processing this wastewater by conventional means costs U.S. industrial facilities more than $40B per year. A breakthrough in nanofiltration technology will allow industries across the country - such as food processors, landfills, power plants, and paper mills - to easily and affordably clean their wastewater. This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop the technology and processes to produce commercial-scale anti-fouling nanofiltration membranes for use with highly contaminated industrial wastewater. The project will combine large-scale manufacturing techniques such as high-precision spray coating with a novel chemistry platform based on zwitterionic copolymers to produce high-performance, low-cost membranes. These polymers exhibit extraordinary resistance to organic fouling as well as pore self-assembly at the nanometer scale. To achieve the required performance, the project will develop the process and materials to achieve a thickness of less than one micron in the selective layer of a thin-film composite. Currently, layers of this thickness are only achievable using in-situ polymerization of nylon-based polymers, which are costly, have low permeability, and are intolerant of oxidizing conditions. This project will overcome these limitations by exploiting the unique self-assembly behavior of zwitterionic copolymers to achieve ultrathin, uniformly porous films in both flat sheet and hollow fiber forms. The project will furthermore demonstrate the chemical robustness of these membranes with accelerated lifecycle testing relevant to industrial conditions.

College textbooks and homework are being replaced with web-based learning materials that are highly-interactive, involving animations, learning questions, and auto-generated auto-graded homework/quiz exercises. The project develops those exercises to adjust (adapt) to the learner's performance as well as to the learner's preferences, providing a novel structured form of adaptivity that maximizes learning efficiency while reducing student anxiety, in contrast to many other proposed adaptive techniques. The project creates new content for the topics of Algebra and for Statistics, two critical subjects with which many college students struggle. The result will be greater success (and less failure) in Algebra and Statistics courses by young college students, leading to more graduates in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields, which contribute greatly to the nation's productivity and competitiveness. The techniques can be applied to many other STEM and non-STEM subjects, and for learning beyond college courses too. This SBIR Phase II project develops novel adaptive techniques for web-based learning materials, called structured student-guided adaptive (SSGA) techniques. In contrast to some recent adaptive commercial products, SSGA preserves the ability of an instructor to maintain a structured path through the material, which is critical for keeping students in synch with lecture/discussion sessions, for enabling students to study with classmates, and more. Adaptivity comes in several forms, including auto-generating successively-harder problems based on correct completion of earlier problems, with explanations and source material carefully integrated to ensure students learn underlying concepts. Also, the adaptivity is in part guided by the student, who can choose to start with simpler or harder problems, or can auto-generate self-quizzes based on performance, selected material, and more. In contrast with other products, student-guided adaptivity gives students appropriate control over their learning, yielding a sense of empowerment and reducing anxiety that can inhibit learning. The project builds the authoring platform necessary to support SSGA material creation, building upon a previously-developed authoring framework for interactive web material. The project also creates new material for college algebra and statistics courses, whose high attrition rates can be reduced by replacing traditional textbooks/homework with SSGA material."

The project aims to model learning as a complex dynamics system, and to develop a user-model that incorporates student profile data with a detailed and large set of markers on usage and performance collected from an analytics engine. These markers can be derived from a student's learning and social activities, such as her interaction with various types of learning resources, participation on question and answer forums and so on. This model then guides a recommender system to select appropriate resources from a learning catalog based on the student's unique learning path. Whereas, the project uses open source recommender algorithms, the intellectual merit lies in developing a user model, identifying the specific markers that impact learning, automatically reconfiguring the learning material, and in demonstrating its viability for algebra learners. This model will be built leveraging some of the latest infrastructures in education technology including an authoring and delivery framework, a learning catalog of 10 million curated learning resources, and the latest advances in data-analytics and information filtering systems. The broader/commercial impact lies in using the proposed technology to replace textbooks and other less-advanced learning systems, not only in mathematics, but also in other STEM disciplines, making it easier, faster and more affordable for students to learn. To an extent, it will level the playing field by providing equal access to a personalized 1-on-1 type of experience, even for those students who don't have the opportunity to get high quality instruction and mentorship today. It will significantly impact students who today struggle with mathematics and STEM subjects, by providing alternate and more relevant ways for them to visualize and learn. Additionally, Zyante's technology and expanded services will enable colleges/universities to offer high-quality online courses and successfully handle larger enrollments. All this will ultimately improve national outcomes and provide a better-trained workforce in disciplines needed to drive the economic success of the US. For these reasons, it is important that the proposed technology be readily commercialized."

The interactive content, featuring animations, interactive question sets, and online tools, along with some text, may replace or enhance traditional textbooks, with studies showing significant improvements in student engagement and learning outcomes. The project addresses the nationwide high dropout rates of STEM students, due in part to outmoded learning materials. Such dropout rates not only prevent students from achieving their career goals, but result in a shortage of college graduates in nationally-critical STEM fields. The project creates novel web-based tools that empower teachers, and even students, to straightforwardly contribute new interactive content, thus tapping the latent talent and energy of many thousands of people. The project creates automated and human-overseen processes that efficiently and effectively percolate the highest-quality contributions to the top of lists, enabling content to be created and maintained at large scale and low cost. The project's new publishing paradigm can disrupt the existing publishing industry. The interactive quality content can increase the number of students who successfully graduate in STEM fields, which can strengthen the nation's economy and competitiveness. The project develops a new web-based content authoring and delivery framework that supports a novel curated-crowdsourced publishing paradigm. The framework tightly integrates collaborative web-based authoring with delivery of animated interactive web-based content. The project develops elegant tools for instructors, and even students, to contribute new interactive items. Such tools include a novel browser-based animation creation tool, which allows powerful animations to be easily and quickly created via any web browser without requiring application installation or requiring extensive tool training. The project creates and tests new processes that, via a combination of peer evaluations, usage data, and assessments, automatically percolate quality contributions to the top, for final curation by instructors, authors, or editors. Such percolation crowdsourcing can yield superior learning materials, at scale and cost-effectively, while simultaneously yielding substantially lower prices than traditional textbooks."

The confluence of HTML5, cloud services, and ubiquitous portable devices enables widespread use of web-native content having engaging effective activities for students including animations, interactive simulators including mini-games, and self-assessments. Such content is difficult to develop/maintain in traditional publishing paradigms involving a small author/editor core team. A wiki-style crowdsourced approach, with oversight by an author/editor core team, is more scalable but web-based authoring tools support only limited content types like text or drawings. The project's intellectual merit lies in developing a novel web-based authoring tool for creating HTML5 code for animations, including a novel automated synthesis of the code from abstract restricted-form English-sentence specifications inspired by experiences in developing state-of-the-art automated circuit synthesis techniques. The merit also lies in a new repository of parameterized interactive simulations with potentially wide applicability in STEM fields. Results will include the initial tool and repository, plus use by instructors and graduate students from several universities to demonstrate crowdsourcing feasibility. The broader/commercial impact of this project includes catalyzing a new partnering approach between a publisher and universities, striking a new balance between core-team authored content and crowdsourcing. A core author/editor team creates initial content and outlines needs, requiring less upfront investment, and the community adopts the content and contributes items under the core team's curation. Curated crowdsourced content can dramatically improve content and reduce creation/maintenance costs. The approach can expand to curated crowdsourced homeworks, automated grading, online help tools, quizzing services, student performance analysis, and more, unleashing synergy among universities to build common tools that benefit the community, a necessity made manifest due to drastic reductions in university budgets. The project's initial focus on computer science lower-division topics may yield company revenues of $5M in textbooks within a few years and $10M considering expanded services shifted from university to company, for CS alone, and $40M-$50M for multiple STEM disciplines. The addressable market for lower division STEM is $1B textbooks and $2B expanded services. The project's approach provides a practical strategy, with individual instructors initially adopting the content as a textbook replacement for campus-based or online classes, followed by possible expanded service arrangements made with departments/universities."

These objectives will be pursued within the framework of Phase II production of functioning arrays.  From earlier work in the thermal infrared, the detector array is projected to be very sensitive compared to existing bolometers, with a response time permitting high frame rates, high pixel count, and development of imaging arrays of high resolution (pixel count).

The Phase-II main objective is to refine the Phase-I design and build a lightweight working ADRWD prototype that can accurately measure the runway deflection and correctly evaluate the load carrying capacity of any runway to give a go or not go answer for a class of airplane. In order to realize this goal we have deeply analyzed those big RWDs and found that there are 7 serious problems must be overcome: (1) the measurement assumptions and calculating equations are questionable, (2) it is impossible to measure the deflection at the same point in the two-step and two-point procedure, (3) the two-step procedure will get large error from the truck vibration and pavement unevenness, (4) the two-point measurement cannot get the deflection basin, (5) the error from support beam bending should be simply removed, (6) the error from different sensor heights should be eliminated, (7) the effects of the dust, dirt and moisture to the sensor window should be prevented. The key of our new design to solve these problems is to put a sensor between the front tire and rear tire without deflection and put 3 sensors behind the rear tire with deflection and sample their data simultaneously then make average and subtraction to get the relative deflection basin and eliminate the errors from pavement unevenness, truck vibration, test not at exact point, and so on. In Phase-II, we will build and deliver 3 prototypes: (1) use high accuracy laser rangefinders with inclinometer, speed/distance encoder, GPS and ground marker to get the deflection profile, (2) add the thermal scanner and ground penetration radar to the above for layer analysis, (3) add a portable falling weight deflectometer to the system (1) for test verification at discrete points. Since there is no software can be adopted from existing RWD, two new software packages will be developed: (1) automatic high speed sensor operation and data collection software and ASIC, (2) backcalculation and runway load bearing capacity estimation equations and data analysis software to get a 3-D runway deflection and defects profile with ground marks as a function of space and time. In addition to the airport application, the portable ADRWD will be used for highways, gas stations and many other places; the technology related with laser rangefinder, IR, Radar, etc. will be used for railway defects inspection and missile defense and their prototypes will be built up in Phase-II as a part of commercial applications."

Current FWD, DCP and RWD cannot satisfy the mission requirement. The air force is looking for an air droppable lighter weight RWD that can rapidly collect continuous data using sensor technologies. In this proposal, a lightweight RWD with same tire pressure as the big RWD is proposed. Instead of using a rotating mirror an innovative sensor array using linear IR laser diode array and detector array sharing a common optical axis is designed. One sensor array will be put at a location under truck before loading and the other will be put after loading to measure the perpendicular distance from the laser to the runway. Two arrays will be mounted on a H-shape suspension platform with the same height and will be aligned each other precisely. By subtracting the data from two sensor arrays we not only can quantitatively measure the deflection of the runway but also can eliminate all systematic errors caused by vibration etc. If we use our unique parabolic LED array to replace the laser diode array, the total saving will be over $10,000 and the system reliability can be largely increased. In addition to the above sensor arrays, a stereo camera using linear CCD & LIR fused arrays is also designed to not only visualize the runway deformation after loading but also detect the void underneath the runway. Since all optical sensors cannot penetrate the runway, simple microwave impulse radar is also designed to show the void and construction under the runway. Because the RWD is air droppable it should not use a driver, therefore a novel robot is designed to operate the sensors in the RWD and drive the RWD to any place on the runway, and the data will be wirelessly sent to a remote computer for analysis. After finishing the runway survey the RWD will return to the start point and wait for pickup by the helicopter. In order to calibrate the RWD data, our automatic FWD and DCP operated by the robot and developed in one phase-I and two phase-II projects for Army and SOF will be used to measure the runway stiffness and CBR at certain points, thus the relationship between the RWD deflection and the runway strength can be established. Not only all above new sensor prototypes but also a bench scale RWD prototype will be delivered to the Air Force in phase-I."

(2) Measure the obstacles and surface roughness and create a methodfor automatic obstacle avoidance. (3) Measure the runway size and slope.

Hardware and software will be developed to let the robot avoid obstacles and holes automatically. The laser scanner will share the laserdiode and the common optical aperture with the laser rangefinder, so the laser rangefinder can measure the runway size by using the pulsed mode. If the robot can find several reference points with known heights, the laser rangefinder also can measure therunway slope. Of course, we also can use an inclinometer to measure the slope quickly. A digital modem using spread spectrum and secret encryption codes will be designed to send the measured and compressed data 30-km away to the computer at the controlcenter to produce the 3-D runway map with size, slope, obstacles, unevenness, CBR, and other parameters by using the AutoCAD and image processing software.The new robot with GPS navigation will be delivered in 6 months, and the innovative remote assault zone survey system satisfying all SOW requirements will be demonstrated at the government selected site."

Because TdP is associated with prolongation of the QT interval (long QT) on electrocardiograms, new drugs must now be tested for their effect on long QT before they can be approved. Thus, assays to predict QT prolongation have become increasingly important to the pharmaceutical industry. Current assays are performed in vitro or in cell culture and are limited by biological simplicity, low throughput, a high rate of false positives, and an inability to detect drug-drug interactions. In vivo assays in mammals are expensive and time-consuming. A great need exists for an in vivo assay that can rapidly and accurately predict QT prolongation in humans. A recent study showed that compounds that cause long QT in humans cause bradycardia in live zebrafish embryos. In Phase I, we propose to refine this assay to more accurately predict which compounds will cause long QT in humans, develop algorithms for automation of the assay to increase throughput, and to further develop the assay for detecting drug-drug interactions caused by inhibition of Cytochrome P450 3A, the enzyme responsible for most known drug-drug interactions in humans.

Zygogen is developing a novel in vivo approach to identifying potential lipid-lowering drugs using Zebrafish, called Z-Lipotrack. Lipid processing is highly conserved in the Zebrafish. Because Zebrafish larvae are essentially transparent, lipid processing can be readily observed in the whole organism, with the aid of fluorescent lipid reporters. The goal of the proposed research is to develop Z-Lipotrack technology for use in high throughput compound screening, with the ultimate aim of discovering better drugs for lowering lipid levels. The proposed work will validate Z-Lipotrack as a compound screening tool. This includes testing additional control compounds, characterizing compounds identified in a small but diverse library of marketed drugs, and quantifying the fluorescent read-out in an automated fashion. Due to the high fecundity of Zebrafish, high throughput drug screening using Zebrafish larvae is feasible and could dramatically increase the chances of finding important new drugs."

Following radical prostatectomy (RP), virtually all men experience erectile dysfunction (ED),
primarily due to damage to the cavernous nerve (CN). Yet, first-line treatments for ED, orally
administered phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5i), fail to elicit an erectile response for a
majority of patients suffering from ED as a result of RP (ED-RP). Alternative treatments are highly
invasive and/or have poor efficacy and are typically not even attempted. For a man who
experiences ED following RP, the trauma of back-to-back diagnoses (cancer and ED) has a
profound impact on quality-of-life, relationships, and well-being. There is, therefore, an urgent
need to find a novel approach to the treatment of ED in this patient group.
A primary factor in the development of ED-RP is that damage to the CN during RP impairs
neuronal signals that release sufficient NO from CN endings to initiate an erection. Thus,
formulations that increase local levels of NO may elicit an erectile response in the absence of
neuronal signals and may also enable cooperativity with PDE5i to enhance the erectile response.
This hypothesis was proven in Phase I where it was demonstrated that a novel transdermal
microparticle delivery system for NO (NO-MP) was able to elicit an erectile response when
administered alone or in combination with 1/10 the human equivalent dose of the leading PDE5i,
sildenafil. When NO-MP and sildenafil were used in combination, an improvement in the time for
onset of the first erectile response was observed, and the number of erections was greater than
treatment with NO-MP alone.
In Specific Aim 1 of Phase II, we will determine if the cooperativity in eliciting an erectile response
seen between NO-MP and sildenafil exists with other members of the FDA-approved PDE5i class.
This will confirm that the observation in Phase I is class-specific and will expand/define the
portfolio of potential commercial partners. In Specific Aim 2 we will initiate a GMP start-up program
at ZylÃ¶ Therapeutics and confirm that a demonstration batch is as effective in eliciting an erectile
response as the small batch prep used in Specific Aim 1. Specific Aim 3 will establish the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in dose-range-finding studies conducted in rats and minipigs in
order to inform the design of later IND-enabling toxicology studies. In addition, a dermal sensitivity
study in guinea pigs and a dermal irritation study in rabbits will be conducted as part of the suite
of safety studies required by the FDA for topical products. Finally, in Specific Aim 4, a pre-IND
meeting will be held with the FDA to finalize remaining studies required for an IND application and
initiation of a Phase I clinical study.
At the conclusion of these phase II studies, we expect to have: (i) confirmed that NO-MP is
cooperative across the PDE5i class; (ii) generated a demonstration batch of NO-MP with
confirmed efficacy; (iii) conducted dermal toxicity studies to provide sensitivity and irritation data
and to establish the MTD; and (iv) consulted with the FDA regarding future development work
during a pre-IND meeting. Overall, we will be ready to initiate further toxicity studies in preparation
for an IND filing and a Phase I clinical trial.Narrative
Virtually all men experience erectile dysfunction (ED) following radical prostatectomy (RP), yet
standard treatment with first-line, orally administered phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) is
ineffective, as these treatments are dependent on the production of nitric oxide (NO) from
cavernous nerve (CN) endings. In Phase I, a novel topical microparticle delivery system for nitric
oxide (NO-MP) was shown to elicit an erectile response in an animal model of RP (CN
transection), both as monotherapy and in combination with 1/10th the human-equivalent dose of
the leading PDE5i, sildenafil. The goal for Phase II is to (i) confirm that NO-MP is cooperative
across the PDE5i class; (ii) generate a demonstration batch of NO-MP with confirmed efficacy;
(iii) conduct dermal toxicity studies to generate sensitivity and irritation data and to establish the
maximum tolerated dose; and (iv) consult with the FDA during a pre-IND meeting regarding future
development work required to initiate a Phase I clinical trial."

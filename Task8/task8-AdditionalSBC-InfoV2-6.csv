X-COR Therapeutics is creating the first extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R) device that uses
dialysis-like approaches to accessibly treat hypercapnic respiratory failure (HRF) patients. HRF is a
devastating consequence of critical lung disease caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
and other respiratory disorders including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a common complication
of COVID-19. The current standard of care for severe disease is invasive mechanical ventilation, which results
in a ~30% mortality rate and increased susceptibility to ARDS. While use of protective ventilatory strategies
reduces mortality, resultant hypercapnia from protective ventilation resembles diseases like COPD. In both
cases, impaired ventilation causes increased carbon dioxide (CO2) levels that lead to acidosis, coma, and
death. For patients with hypercapnia, extracorporeal technologies that deliver oxygen and remove gaseous
CO2 (e.g. ECMO) present possible alternatives but are highly invasive and costly. They require high blood flow
rates (andgt;1 L/min) and large-bore cannula only deployable in specialized facilities.
Here, we propose investigating a hybrid device that resembles a hemodialysis-like blood filtration cartridge that
contains a novel configuration of two filtration fibers for bicarbonate dialysis and gaseous CO2 capture. High
efficiency CO2 removal allows a low blood rate of andlt;250 ml/min, thus allowing small catheters (andlt;13.5 Fr) to
replace the 28-30 Fr cannula used today in most extracorporeal therapies. Less invasive and standard
vascular access makes this therapy accessible and enables its use in parallel with invasive mechanical
ventilation. With parallel therapy, the proposed device can prevent hypercapnia that results from protective
ventilation and enable safer use of invasive mechanical ventilation with earlier extubation. Because it can use
existing hemodialysis systems, the device can be deployed with existing workflows and capital equipment.
The objective of this Phase I SBIR project is to optimize and then investigate ventilatory benefits from using a
hybrid membrane filtration device that removes CO2 from ultra-low extracorporeal blood flow. Aim 1 is to
determine optimal device geometries and operating parameters (e.g. size, fiber pack density, and fiber ratio)
that meet desired CO2 capture requirements through iterative modification of a novel design using scalable
production methods. Each iteration will be evaluated using bench-top ex-vivo perfusion testing. Aim 2 is to
investigate the impact that extracorporeal CO2 capture has on patient spontaneous and assisted ventilatory
requirements using a series of physiologic computational models using patient-specific boundary conditions.
Successful completion of this project will result in a manufacture-ready device with candidate geometries and
operating parameters for pre-clinical testing. This device will be able to: 1) remove andgt;30% of CO2 produced; 2)
be produced using scalable manufacturing; and 3) be interoperable with existing hemodialysis platforms. This
is a critical step for advancing toward future pre-clinical and clinical studies in support of FDA approval.PROJECT RELEVANCE
The proposed device and methodology meet a critical unmet need for a safer, more accessible treatment that
removes carbon dioxide from the blood of patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure (HRF) resulting from
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or complications during treatment of severe COVID-19. Current
treatment methods rely on invasive mechanical ventilation that require resource-heavy intensive care unit
hospitalizations and can potentially further damage the lungs. This proposal investigates a novel approach for
carbon dioxide removal in a system that is comparable to hemodialysis instead of more invasive systems like
ECMO, allowing use of safer ventilatory protocols and shortening intensive care unit stays."

ELLIS,,(919) 619-0388,gepardieu@aol.com,Stub,,,,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ABSTRACT Interruption and subsequent restoration of circulation in tissues causes varying amounts of ischemia- reperfusion injury (IRI). IRI is a detrimental feature of many clinical events such as organ transplants, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) used in cardiac surgery, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. There is currently no effective therapy to prevent or reduce IRI. This proposal focuses on cerebral IRI, a significant clinical problem contributing to considerable morbidity and large numbers of deaths. When an artery is occluded, there is an area of tissue that is deprived of oxygen and nutrients, leading to necrosis and infarction. However, there is a large border zone around the infarction that does not get sufficient circulation to function normally, but enough to survive. This area at risk (AAR), known in the brain as the penumbra, experiences IRI, even without acute restoration of circulation. IRI is associated with early increased endothelial permeabilityand edema and later, changes in gene expression, resulting in inflammation. There is growing awareness of the vital role played by the innate immune system in IRI. The innate immune system is comprised of extracellular and intracellular receptors that activate multiple signaling molecules controlling gene transcription leading to an inflammatory phenotype. This very complex system evolved over 700 million years to protect uni- and multi- cellular organisms from infection with bacteria, fungi, viruses and other pathogens. Involvement of the innate immune system in IRI is puzzling - there is no infection, although there is tissue damage due to infarction that is misinterpreted by the receptors of the innate immune system as infection. This concept - that IRI is a biologic mistake - is the basis of X-In8 Biologicals Corp. Inhibiting activation of the innate immune system temporarily may have a profound impact on IRI and dramatically reduce the size of the penumbra, resulting in much less tissue damage and smaller strokes. Our research has implicated TLR4 as a mediator of lung edema and inflammation due to lung IRI. Thus, we are proposing to test CRX-526, a potent TLR4 inhibitor, for efficacy to prevent and/or reduce cerebral IRI. Our initial target applications are prevention of IRI during stroke and treatment of acute cerebral artery occlusion. However, because the innate immune system is involved in the delayed phase of IRI, therapeutic intervention soon after a stroke may be highly beneficial as well. Beyond cerebral IRI, any successful therapy to reduce IRI would have a profound impact on organ transplantation, myocardial damage due to CPB, and the natural history and treatment for MI and stroke.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major problem in many clinical scenarios, including organ transplantation, myocardial infarction, and stroke. When a cerebral artery is occluded due to embolic stroke, inflammation and edema due to IRI is responsible for a large amount of neuronal cell death in the penumbrum, a large zone around the infarcted area. Because toll-like receptors (TLRs) of the innate immune system, particularly TLR4 and TLR2, mediate much of the inflammation associated with IRI in many organs, including the brain, this proposal outlines novel experiments to determine the impact of inhibiting TLR4 activation with a potent TLR4 inhibitor, that appears to have some inhibitory effects on TLR2 in endothelial cells, through collaboration of a university-based expert in cerebral IRI, and X-In8, a new biotechnology company with a novel concept about IRI. In Phase I we propose to evaluate the impact of TLR4 inhibition using an established in vivo model of brain IRI, and proven methods to quantify edema due to brain IRI. When wedetermine a benefit of TLR4 inhibition in this model, in Phase 2 we propose to determine efficacy of this approach in translational small and large animal models of stroke and acute interventions to restore circulation to ischemic areas of brain."

This leads to a series of biologic consequences, resulting in edema and inflammation. IRI is a significant problem in organ transplantation, because IRI is the major cause of primary graft failure and organ dysfunction after transplant. IRI is also a major problem in many clinical scenarios, including cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) used in cardiac surgery, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. There are currently no effective therapies to prevent or reduce IRI. Graft injury due to IRI at the time of implantation is now recognized as a major contributor to delayed graft dysfunction, also known as chronic rejection. Lung transplantation (LTX) has extended and improved the lives of thousands of patients with end-stage lung disease, but is severely constrained by an inadequate supply of suitable donors from conventional organ donors (brain-dead, ventilated patients whose organs are retrieved after controlled cardiac arrest). Among solid organs transplanted, lungs have one of the highest rates of acute graft failure, and the highest incidence of late graft failure. Hundreds of transplant candidates die every year before receiving LTX, and thousands of others are not even considered candidates because of the lung donor shortage. If lungs could be retrieved from non-heart-beating donors (NHBDs) - victims of sudden death - at intervals after circulatory arrest and transplanted safely, the shortage of lungs for transplant could be eliminated, and the lives of thousands more patients with end-stage lung disease could be extended or enhanced by LTX. Transplant using lungs retrieved from NHBDs is also associated with IRI. Any therapy to reduce lung IRI would have significant clinical impact; it could improve both short- and long-term results of conventional LTX, and it could facilitate LTX from NHBDs. In addition, reducing IRI in other organs would have far-reaching implications in organ transplantation and in CPB, MI, and stroke. We have identified receptors and effector pathways of the innate immune system as important contributors to inflammation due to IRI. Among these, there is growing evidence from our group and others that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a critical contributor to IRI in transplant and to other IRI models. The purpose of the Phase I STTR is to determine if CRX-526, a TLR4 inhibitor that we showed prevents edema due to IRI, can ameliorate lung IRI. X-In8 is a biotechnology company whose mission is to develop strategies to temporarily turn off innate immunity to prevent IRI. Demonstrating effectiveness of CRX-526 to reduce IRI in relevant translational cell culture models of IRI and LTX models will justify Phase II studies using survival LTX models to evaluate commercial applications in the LTX market, followed by studies in other types of organ transplant and other clinical scenarios of IRI such as CPB, MI, and stroke.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), which occurs when blood flow stops and then starts again, causes damage to tissue or organs in heart attacks, strokes, heart bypass surgery, and organ transplantation. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) of the innate immune system, in particular TLR4, contribute to edema and inflammation in IRI. In Phase I, we will determine the benefit of inhibiting TLR4 activation with CRX-526, an agent that we showed prevents edema due to IRI; in Phase II we plan to determine efficacy of CRX-526 in lung transplantation. This work may expand the supply of healthy lungs for transplant and could stop IRI in heart attack, stroke or heart bypass."

This allows the use of sensitive detectionthresholds, and, in an actual fault condition, may allow an aircraft to maintain enough control to complete a mission or to safely land.Phase 1 research will examine various arc quenching algorithms in a laboratory testbed.  Arcing severity will be characterized through infrared sensors and power will be removed and then restored with varying schedules to examine the conditions underwhich an arc may be tolerably controlled through solid state switching.  The proposed technology represents an augmentation that will be compatible with existing arc fault detection/interruption technologies.  While applicable to both DC and ACelectrical systems, it will have its greatest impact on DC arc fault control where only the severest of faults are presently detectable. By allowing a higher sensitivity fault detection threshold to be used, the proposed research enhances sensitivity forarc fault interrupter circuits, increasing the safety they can provide to both commercial and military aircraft.  Since aircraft are routinely maintained in service beyond their intended design life, this represents an important addition to thestate-of-the-art and a mature technology should enjoy wide acceptance in both markets.  In the commercial nonaviation market, arc fault interrupters are presently mandated in new construction in the U.S. (market potential of over 4 million units peryear), have been mandated for air conditioners beginning in 2004 (5.7 million units per year) and will see expanded use in the electric and hybrid electric vehicle markets."

As a result, fluoroscopic radiation levels are higher for the average patient than they would be with a more efficient grid system, and higher still for large patients. Poor image quality often increases the beam-on time required to successfully perform interventional procedures, increasing the radiation dose still further. This problem is critical in interventional exams, where skin doses are occasionally high enough to induce radiation burns1-3, and effective doses often exceed those of CT exams4 and contribute about 14% of the nationwide effective dose from medical imaging procedures5. Our proposal is to develop a high efficiency antiscatter grid system that will result in a significant improvement in fluoroscopy system dose efficiency. The results of our benchmarked Monte Carlo modeling indicate that a factor of 1.5 to 2.0 or more improvement is achievable.Cardiologists and radiologists can use this improvement either to produce higher quality images at current fluoroscopic radiation levels, allowing them to shorten exams, or to produce images comparable to today's image quality standards at markedly lower dose rates. The proposed innovative antiscatter grid system will incorporate a coarse strip density, air interspaced grid and a reciprocating grid drive with innovative approaches to suppress vibrations and grid artifacts. In Phase I we will build a grid and drive system and demonstrate: 1) the use of the system in fluorographic (digital spot) imaging; 2) the robust suppression of grid artifacts; and 3) a dose efficiency at least 1.5 times greater than that of commonly used grids. In Phase II we will build avibration-free reciprocating drive system suitable for fluoroscopic imaging, a compact x-ray tube grid bias supply to perform fast x-ray switching for short x-ray pulses, and with our manufacturing partner we will modify a commercially available clinicalfluoroscopy unit to demonstrate the use and performance of the grid system. Of practical importance is that the domestic manufacturer has already expressed interest in evaluating the grid system for inclusion in their product line and in commercializing the technology.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Millions of fluoroscopic examinations are performed each year, and these exams often result in high patient radiation doses and injury1-3, are among the highest dose exams in medical imaging4, and account for 14% of the effective dose from medical imaging in the United States5. We propose to improve the dose efficiency of fluoroscopy by a factor of 1.5 to 2.0 or more. This significant improvement will be accomplished by building an innovative high efficiency antiscatter grid system; clinical fluoroscopic systems using this grid system will be able to achieve markedly improved image quality at current radiation dose levels, or alternatively will be able to achieve image quality comparable to that obtained on today's fluoroscopic systems at a fraction of the radiation dose."

In recent years this problem has been aggravated by the use of less efficient (thin, high line density, low lead content) grids, and the increasing size of patients. As a result, radiographic image quality is often insufficient to answer questions concerning trauma and other clinical areas, and patients undergo additional higher dose, more expensive imaging exams. In many instances these additional exams could be eliminated and health care costs reduced if a better radiographic imaging system were available. We propose a coarse, high-ratio air interspace grid coupled to an orthogonally aligned low-ratio conventional grid. Together, these will effectively eliminate scatter and will have a primary transmission comparable to commonly used grids. A low-ratio grid is compatible with a range of source-to-image distances (SIDs). The coarse grid will have articulating grid slats, permitting variable SIDs and angled views. In order to build a compact and clinically acceptable system, the coarse grid can only move a short distance to blur out grid lines. It has been demonstrated that this can be accomplished by employing a quasi-trapezoidal x-ray tube current waveform. In Phase I we propose to demonstrate that an appropriate quasi-trapezoidal x-ray tube current waveform can be obtained in general radiography. In Phase II we propose to design and construct a compact and high efficiency crossed-grid system, interface it to an x-ray generator, and demonstrate that it can control scatter much more effectively than a conventional grid. The system will be able to accommodate general radiography, chest radiography, angled projections, tomography, and a range of SIDs. It can be used with either screen-film or digital image receptors, and will improve tomosynthesis and dual energy applications.

The intervention at the manufacturing or distribution center will substantially eliminate the exposure to the consumer at home, school, work, or from the product that ends up in a landfill. This electronics manufacturing analyzer will be fit for purpose on the factory floor, enabled by new, powerful, proprietary, monochromatic doubly curved crystal (DCC) X-ray optics, source configurations, and associated software that greatly increases the efficiency and sensitivity for this elemental analysis. These toxins occur naturally in the environment, but also are included in manufacturing processes for purposes such as UV resistance, durability, and strength. Abnormal levels of these toxic elements in the body areknown to be associated with many health disorders such as cancer, cognitive impairment, as well as respiratory, cardiological, and other neurological symptoms. In spite of their recognized importance, only recently have these toxic metals been regulated atlevels exceeding current practical measurement techniques (i.e. Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive of 2002, and Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008). Current field-portable instrumentation does not meet the quantitative needs of manufacturers or regulatory agencies. This has caused a significant shift to laboratory-based measurements which are accurate, but they are also complex, time-consuming, and expensive. That approach requires sample transportation, handling, delays, and highlytrained operators. The laboratories certified for such measurements are also limited in number and regional in distribution. As a result, neither solution is fit for purpose. The toxic element analyzer proposed in this project is based on advancing the X-ray optics and software capability for use in electronics and toys, while simultaneously making it simple-to-use for any operator with minimal training. The new system will allow unprecedented X-ray fluorescence of sensitivity for simultaneously measuringmost regulated elemental toxins, including traditionally difficult to measure elements such as cadmium, antimony, and barium. The proposed new analyzer changes the public-health situation dramatically by offering an inexpensive, reliable elemental toxin analyzer that is fit for purpose on the factory floor. By intervening at the source, this instrument will reduce or eliminate the risk of unknowing direct exposure from our consumer products as well as indirect exposure in the environment from disposal of these items in a landfill. This will reduce health-care costs, and simultaneously improve regulatory compliance capabilities.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed electronics and manufacturing analyzer has the potential to substantially mitigate or even eliminate many toxic element exposures by intervening at the source with a quantitative, simple-to-use, substantially matrix independent, and nondestructive instrument to identify problems at the factory or distribution center before the toxins reach the home, school, or work place. The positive impacts to public health include decreased toxic element exposure, which leads to reduced public-health effects, reduced remediation costs, and reduced health-care costs. The applicability for such an instrumentis vast and includes testing for the regulated toxic elements (i.e. Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive of 2002, or Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008) in electronics, other related consumer products, and products intended for children."

The techniques start in a lab, are continued in a pilot campaign, and finally graduate to full-scale manufacturing. To improve drug quality and manufacturing, in 2001, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated Quality by Design (QbD) and Process Analytical Technology (PAT) Guidance for the pharmaceutical industry. This project will provide the ability to comply with that guidance and continuously monitor pharmaceutical quality during manufacturing. Crystallization of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) involves achieving a specific crystalline phase, for which there can also be multiple polymorphic forms, a critical factor for drug effectiveness. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) is the 'gold standard' analytical tool to determine API crystalline phase composition and polymorphic form. Unfortunately, PXRD is not currently used online real-timebecause of the configuration requirements for conventional PXRD. It is currently applied offline in the laboratory because of constraining sample presentation requirements and the system size, complexity, and operator-skill requirements of conventional PXRD systems. Recent developments at X-Ray Optical Systems (XOS) of collimating optics and detector systems provide an opportunity to overcome these problems and enable a wide range of online PXRD applications. The objective of the proposed project is development of a reliable, easy-to-use, compact, and safe PXRD system for continuous monitoring of crystalline characteristics of API real-time during drug development and manufacture. This will improve process control and, therefore, assurance of product quality by directly measuring the pharmaceutical critical quality attributes rather than reliance on monitoring process conditions supported by relatively infrequent sampling. The project focuses on online measurements during the API crystallization phase. Thiswill be done with pharmaceutical industry collaborators at Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS). Feasibility for such measurements has been demonstrated on the benchtop during Phase I studies. It will be demonstrated online at a BMS pharmaceutical research and manufacturing facility in Phase II. Phase II will include all of the necessary instrument development steps required to design, assemble, and test the prototype. This includes sample presentation, the fixed detector approach, and integrating the analyzer with an existing reactor at BMS. XOS has extensive experience with online optic-enabled XRD and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) applications. The proposed project is a match with the NIH Research Objectives for the Manufacturing Processes of Medical, Dental, and Biological Technologies topic as a systems-level technology. Improved drug quality, improved public health, reduced manufacturing costs, and reduced health-care costs are the ultimate goals.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed analyzer will increase control over the quality of pharmaceuticals by providing the ability to measure the actual drug crystalline/molecular form during the process for the first time, compared to current practice of just monitoring the manufacturing parameters. The analyzer willbe compact, inexpensive, and able to be set up and operated by operators and technicians. The ability to measure crystallinity in the drug directly online during development, pilot scale up, and full-scale manufacturing will impact public health by improving the consistency of pharmaceutical quality, reducing time to market by faster manufacturing ramp up, reducing manufacturing costs by increased process control, and improving manufacturing compliance through application of the FDA's Process Analytical Technology (PAT) drug certification guidelines."

As a result, it is difficult to discern whether nuclear material is safeguarded correctly, i.e. is it being diverted? The opportunity addressed is a substantial improvement in measurement sensitivity for global safeguards of nuclear material, which directly addresses a primary objective of the DOE global safeguards program. Several approaches for measuring Pu and Cm are used in processing and reprocessing plants today, including gamma ray and neutron counting. There is no elemental discrimination possible with neutron measurements and the gamma-ray background from the fission-product materials masks accurate determination of the Cm content. XOS proposes to develop an ultra high-energy optic-enabled x-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique that is fit-for-purpose in improving measurement scrutiny at quantification by greater than 10X. The team will demonstrate the feasibility of the XRF optics in Phase I, and assemble a prototype in Phase II that will be used for direct measurement of nuclear materials, and as a complimentary method for existing measurement techniques. The Phase I optics development requires a technology development in three areas where XOS is uniquely qualified: optics materials, optics cutting and polishing, and optics bending and forming.

The electrodes in the fuel cell, either the single-element GDE, or an anode and cathode in a complete a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), is the critical electrochemical component for every proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. The catalyst coating of GDE is one of the more expensive manufacturing processes in the MEA production. However, the process is lacking an online technology for catalyst thickness and distribution measurements. As a result, the impact of manufacturing changes as they relate to both production and performance is not fully understood. The unique, optic-based XRF analyzer proposed in the current project will allow real-time measurement of the catalyst-coating thickness and elemental distribution. It will provide timely feedback for the GDE production process where changes or improvements can be accommodated immediately. This would improve yield and the overall performance of the GDE products. The objective of the project is to demonstrate the feasibility, while the ultimate goal is to build an instrument that will be used on a GDE production line.
The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the technique developed would benefit both the manufacturing process as well as the overall performance of the fuel cell system. Fuel cell stack efficiency can drop significantly after a few thousand hours of use, which is part of the reason the fuel cell system is not widely used for stationary distributed energy generation. Thus, there is an immediate need to reduce the degradation rate and extend the stack operating life. The measurement of catalyst coating thickness and distribution in production can be a critical link to understand the performance impacts of subtle production changes. Currently there is no practical online, real-time, continuous, nondestructive method to provide this information. The X-ray analyzer incorporates the latest X-ray optics and makes it possible to achieve the anticipated performance with a low power and compact system. The dual benefit of using manufacturing process control to decrease cost and improve final product performance is attractive, enabling a more competitive industry in the U.S. that is more efficient and has a smaller environmental footprint than before. Further, the measurement techniques developed for the fuel cell process can readily be applied to other similar rolling or coating manufacturing processes."

Restrictions such as the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) are expanding world wide beyond lead to include additional harmful elements at trace levels. The analyzer will provide manufacturers the means to conveniently test their products, raw materials, and components for compliance with the new standards. Currently, there is no practical method to accurately test outside of a lab. The objective is to construct an analyzer for quantifying ten toxic elements at or below regulated levels. The analyzer will use XOS's world-leading x-ray optics to produce multiple monochromatic beams from a single x-ray tube, providing excellent sensitivity, lower limits of detection, and short measurement times for the entire relevant part of the periodic table. It will include advanced software for processing the combined data sets and separating the results for the coatings and substrates. The low-power consumption, reduced maintenance, and compact design are fit for purpose in manufacturing, distribution, or regulatory environments.
The broader impact of this research is the mitigation of inadvertent exposure risk. Toys and other consumer products will be safer as adults and children are protected from toxic elements. American manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and regulators are facing increasing global regulations restricting hazardous substances in manufactured products with associated costs and liability risks. This new testing capability would reduce testing costs by more than 75%, currently more than $1B, compared to existing laboratory-based methods. It would also assist U.S. manufacturers and distributors in cost-effective compliance by testing before the products leave the plant or distribution center, thereby, gaining or preserving their competitive position and avoiding the loss of sales and jobs due to offshore migration of manufacturing. This analyzer will also enable manufactures to safely explore new materials as a substitute for restricted materials. Consumer fears provide U.S. manufacturers an opportunity to increase market share if they can demonstrate safety. Additionally, the societal benefits for consumers are significant. Consumers can be certain the products they buy are safe. The ability to accurately detect toxic elements will help to reduce their proliferation into the marketplace and improve public health. This enables improved quality of life and a reduced health care burden."

There are ten elements regulated for their toxic effects world- wide. The challenge is that these ten elements are difficult or impossible to measure simultaneously at the regulated levels with traditional XRF or any other chemical or combustion technique. It is both difficult and expensive to limit the exposure risk to these toxins for medical, regulatory, and manufacturing teams. Two of the most difficult elements for XRF are cadmium (Cd) and antimony (Sb). In the proposed project, XOS will develop X-ray optics that can be integrated into commercial XRF systems. XOS already provides other x-ray optics for other medical, compliance, and research instruments. The team includes the world leaders in developing optics for and integrating optics into analytical systems. XOS will develop X-ray optics for Cd and Sb measurements that meet or exceed the regulated levels. The proposed optics is based on extending the capabilities of our successful, commercially available monochromatic optics and doubly-curved crystal (DCC) optics to higher energy ranges than are currently possible. Thus, they will retain the high-sensitivity and low-background advantages of the current DCC optics. The optics will be designed, developed, tested, and validated in the proposed project. The proposed new optics for Cd and Sb will be incredibly valuable to epidemiological studies, occupational exposure monitoring, and medical treatment teams, as well as manufacturers by using the optics in an XRF instrument which is accurate, reliable, nondestructive, simple-to-use, inexpensive, and compact. Such an optic-enabled instrument would have a positive impact on public health by rapidly identifying the source and level of risks, screening for toxicity, assessing levels in patients with related diseases (e.g., pulmonary or kidney disease), monitoring patients undergoing chelation therapy, conducting a heavy metal screen for people with an occupational exposure risk, and helping manufacturers and farmers eliminate these toxins. Further, the in-vitro detection of these trace metals could be compared to existing data sets in wider exposure studies such as the Genes, Environment and Health Initiative (GEI). This significantly increases the usefulness and marketability of the instrument. Because of the broad commercial applications, this will enable the production of lower-cost instruments for medical, environmental, and occupational exposure applications. Society will benefit from improved knowledge of the role of these metals which are linked to many respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematological, and musculoskeletal diseases (DHHS 1992, 1999). Use in bone, renal, heart, liver, etc. studies of other medical pathologies and in other fields such as forensic, atmospheric, geological, agricultural, chemical, pharmaceutical etc. will, over time, greatly broaden the medical, scientific, industrial, and, therefore, societal benefits.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will develop the X-ray optics for cadmium and antimony to enable X-ray fluorescence to simultaneously measure the entire range of toxic elements normally monitored for occupational exposure, medical treatment, consumer products, and industrial uses with an instrument which is accurate, reliable, nondestructive, simple-to-use, inexpensive, and compact. Such an optic-enabled instrument would have a positive impact on public health by rapidly identifying the source and level of risks, screening for toxicity, assessing levels in patients with related diseases (e.g., pulmonary or renal disease, and reproductive or developmental effects), monitoring patients undergoing chelation therapy, conducting a heavy metal screen for people with an occupational exposure risk, and helping manufacturers and farmers eliminate these toxins from their products. Further, the in-vitro detection of these trace metals could be compared to existing data sets in wider exposure studies such as the Genes, Environment and Health Initiative (GEI), which significantly increases the usefulness and marketability of the instrument and, therefore, will enable the production of lower- cost instruments for medical, environmental, and occupational exposure applications."

Recent statistics from the engine overhaul depots indicate that greater than 50 percent of the bearings are rejected. Approximately 40 percent of these rejections are due to corrosion. For naval applications, the rejection rate is even higher. Such corrosion leads to premature surface crack initiation and spalling that cascades into accelerated surface damage, high vibration, and eventual catastrophic bearing failure. It is the goal of this project to develop a highly sensitive, compact, light-weight, low-power, reliable, safe, easy to use, inexpensive to own and maintain, x-ray fluorescence analyzer for direct, trace measurement of trace contaminants in gearbox lubricants. The proposed compact, direct, trace element analyzer is based on a number of developments at X-ray Optical Systems (XOS) over a several year period. This includes unique doubly curved crystal (DCC) monochromating and focusing x-ray optics and compact, highly reliable X-Beam x-ray sources. The gearbox lubricant analyzer can be used on the tarmac or flight deck during routine or preflight inspections or potentially can be mounted on aircraft for continuous on-line lubricant monitoring. This new technology has many important potential military and civilian applications.BENEFITS: Given the proposed operating regime of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), there are clearly environments containing corrosion elements like salt water/vapor. The proposed gear box lubrication monitoring product can be designed for use in routine inspections, periodic inspections or even in flight. A successful cost-effective, low power, compact, non-destructive tool for verifying proper gearbox operation would decrease propulsion failure and aircraft mishaps. An additional benefit can be realized if the gear box monitoring system decreased the frequency of inspections because the proposed system was used to improve the process. The initial users of the analyzer would be the aircraft and propulsion manufacturers who supply the engine, lift system and gearbox hardware to the Department of Defense for the F-35 such as Rolls Royce in Indianapolis, Indiana. In some cases, the outside firms that provide evaluation services would also utilize this instrument. Follow on uses of the monitoring technology would be other advanced propulsion and ground based power generation applications where performance, reliability and robustness are important."

Even small, short-term increases in the amount of air particulte contamination in the atmosphere can produce significant increases in both mortality and morbidity from respiratory and cardiovasulare diseases. For example, recent studies show that just two hours of breathing fine particles in a city from sources such as vehicle exhaust and smokestacks can increase the risk of heart attach by 44%. An example of an indirect health rick comes from the highly toxic elementary mercury. It enters the environment principally from burning of coal; gets dispersed by air partifculates; contaminates soil, plants, and bodies of water; concentrates in the good chain and is finally ingested by humans. Because of the importance of air particulates more then 5000 air-particulate monitoring stations have been established in the United States (wilt perhaps four times as many internationally). Most measure the toatal amount (Mass) of air particulte per volume of air, and more recently, the size distribution of particuate matter.

Currently, because of the complexity and expense involved in measuring important trace elements at the parts-per-billion level required, samples must be collected and sent to regional laboratories. Routine, high-sensitivity, point-of-care, measurement of trace elements can be valuable in three distinct ways: 1) Detection and measurement of nonessential toxic metals, such as lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic; 2) Monitoring the concentration of essential elements such as copper, zinc, selenium, chromium and iron, usually in plasma but also in urine and blood, to detect deficiency (related to growth retardation, Menke's disease, cardiovascular disease, etc.), or excess (related to diabetes, cancer, obesity, stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, etc.); and 3) Measurement of the efficiency and rate of removal of toxic or excess elements by chelation therapy.

This is especially true for the so-called redox metals (Iron, Copper, Manganese, and Zinc) which are required for development and operation of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system but also play a central role in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Friedreich's ataxia, and others. In addition, neurotoxic metals such as Lead, Mercury, Arsenic, and Cadmium have been shown to impair neural function even at trace levels. Current methods to monitor the concentration, distribution, and function of metals have specialized benefits but none allow quantitative measurement of the concentration and distribution of the broad range of metals and concentrations of interest. New and efficient x-ray optics now enable monochromatic micro x-ray fluorescence (MMXRF) tools for measurement of virtually all metals in tissue samples with high sensitivity, dynamic range and spatial resolution. Furthermore, this can be achieved with a safe, compact, reliable, low power, cost effective, easy-to- use analyzer that can operate in medical research laboratories directly on tissue samples before they are dried, stained or treated for other complementary studies. The aim of this project is to develop and apply such a point-of-use analyzer.

The satellite position can be determined by an onboard GPS receiver that continuously tracks all-in-view GPS satellites. The objective of this effort is to complete the design of the GPS antenna system and evaluate how well it will meet the Air Force requirements. A low profile GPS microstrip antenna element was designed for this proposal, producing circular polarization at both GPS frequencies L1 and L2. Microstrip patch GPS antennas are often used on missiles, the proposed element is adapted from that demonstrated design. Preliminary impedance match and pattern data was computed for the element which shows good impedance match and element patterns at L1 and L2. The element would be placed at several locations on the satellite. Antenna architectures, element location, and beam control are discussed, with advantages of several architectures compared. This effort will be performed by a Principal Investigator with extensive antenna design experience including patch antennas on missiles, GPS antennas, satellite tracking and communications antennas, and computer-aided design of antennas."

Widespread use of polycapillary optics is currently impeded because after the design stage, the first working prototype may take a month or more of manufacturing effort. Consequently, both the need and the opportunity exists to develop a comprehensive approach to lens production by computer aided design/computer aided manufacture (CAD/CAM). In this Phase I proposal, we will demonstrate the feasibility of controlling the polycapillary lens manufacturing process from design to product by testing and evaluating the critical parameters and developing an approach for real-time computer process control. The work is expected to lead to a process that will condense the production cycle time to one hour. Our expert team of scientists, progrannners and engineers have the key skill set to develop this innovation in automated manufacture of polycapillary optics. Furthermore, as the design-to-product time decreases, the responsiveness and cost effectiveness for single optic and batch production runs for research, medical, military, and industrial applications would dramatically improve. The radically shortened production schedule for advanced technology, polycapillary x-ray optics will directly effect US competitiveness through the sale of optics, and more importantly, the sale of competitively superior x-ray based instruments."

The ghost-point communication involves non-contiguous memory access and hence hardware or software-based packing and unpacking of vector entries. For scalability, the global reductions must be non-blocking to allow the use of pipelined Krylov methods. The major challenge to utilize GPU systems in an MPI environment for algebraic solvers is simultaneously using all available hardware resources, specifically instruction scheduling (i.e., kernel launches), computation, and communication. Achieving this requires MPI support for streams (to overlap MPI kernel launches with communication and computation), efficient non-contiguous memory access nearest neighbor collectives, and GPU efficient non-blocking global reductions. This project will be led by X-ScaleSolutions, in collaboration with Dr. Todd Munson (Argonne National Laboratory and the leader of the PETSc team), Dr. Victor Eijkhout (Texas Advanced Computing Center and a member of the PETSc team) and Dr. Sameer Shende and Dr. Allen Malony (ParaTools, Inc. and the leaders of the TAU team). To address the severe challenge described above, X-ScaleSolutions proposes to design and develop âSMART- PETScâ a Smart Middleware for Accelerating PETSc on modern high-performance computing hardware. We will work along the following directions: 1) developing optimized datatype processing techniques for intra-/inter-node transfers using kernel-fusion novel and advanced capabilities of emerging hardware, 2) designing optimized methods to overlap kernel launch and kernel execution time to enable simultaneous use of all available hardware resources, 3) co-designing PETSc and MVAPICH using the MPI T interface to support user specified GPU streams, 4) supporting in-network collective communication for high-performance and high-overlap non-blocking CPU-/GPU-based collectives, 5) supporting in- network collective communication for high-performance neighborhood collectives, 6) enabling full stack observability and explainability through tight integration with the TAU Performance System using the MPI T interface, 7) measuring the impact of the proposed designs on PETSc end applications, and 8) conducting systematic test and evaluation to ensure proper integration. Tasks 1, 2, parts of 3 and 6, relevant portion of 8 will be carried out as part of Phase-1 activities. The transformative impact of the proposed SMART- PETSc product will be to enable many HPC and DL frameworks/applications that use PETSc APIs to take advantage of the novel features and capabilities on emerging hardware technologies and reap the additive benefits of co-design and tighter integration between PETSc and MVAPICH libraries. We expect that the solutions SMART-PETSc will provide can reduce the communication overhead by up to 5x. This can lead to a significant boost in performance and scalability of many HPC and DL frame- works/applications that use PETSc APIs. The proposed collaboration will not only enable DOE Labs to use the SMART-PETSc middleware on upcoming exascale systems, but also provide a commercial version of this middleware for use by supercomputing centers and cloud providers worldwide."

For example, I/O-intensive HPC, Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) applications are hitting the I/O wall on large-scale systems. These applications are also spending a lot of time in checkpoint-restart phases. The Scalable Checkpoint-Restart (SCR) project, designed and developed by researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), has made considerable progress along these lines. This code has been deployed on many LLNL systems and has demonstrated benefits to many users. The current version of the SCR library needs enhancements and hardening to achieve cross-platform portability and applicability for a diverse range of supercomputers and HPC clouds. The core support within the current SCR library also needs multiple enhancements to satisfy the needs of next generation Exascale systems and applications. The proposed project takes a systematic and comprehensive approach to enhance SCR for next-generation HPC, DL and ML applications using a set of new features, enhancements and capabilities. The project will be led by X-ScaleSolutions, in collaboration with research partners Dr. Kathryn Mohror and Adam Moody (the original developers and maintainers of the SCR library) of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The project will develop a set of innovations in SCR-Exa to take advantage of the various features and mechanisms of the next generation networking, computing, and storage technologies. These innovations include: 1) modular design with plug and play support for a diverse set of resource managers and job launchers, 2) enhanced user interface with Python support, 3) Python bindings for HPC/DL/ML applications and frameworks, 4) optimized designs with asynchronous data transfers, 5) offloading redundancy encoding schemes using multi-threading, 6) I/O acceleration through integration with UnifyFS, 7) designs for checkpoint-restart on sub-communicators, 8) applicability of the SCR library to cloud environments with virtualization support, and 9) integrated development and evaluation.

This is primarily due to the lack of a holistic performance monitoring and analysis tool for the emerging DL area. The proposed DeepIntrospect DI) product will build upon existing and recognized capabilities to enhance state-of- the-art capabilities to holistically monitor, analyze, and understand the performance of DL applications and frameworks on next-generation HPC systems. X-ScaleSolutions proposes to create Deep- Introspect DI), a highly efficient and easy to use tool for performance engineering of extreme-scale deep learning applications. To realize our vision for the DI tool we propose the following key develop- ment goals: 1) Develop a Performance Monitoring framework for CPU, GPU, interconnects intra-node and inter-node), and file systems; 2) Design an integrated profiler to capture low-level communication statistics as well as offer high-level insights into application layerâs performance; 3) Develop a unified log parser with basic and advanced modules to combine various sources of performance data; 4) Design a responsive GUI that can act as a one-stop dashboard for all DI users; 5) Develop a high-performance DataStore including support for text-based logs as well as a structured database for efficient access; 6) Design the connectors API for internal usage as well as for interoperatability with external tools; and 7) Develop a plugin architecture for GUI and implement one plugin as an example for external developers. As part of Phase-I activities, we will work on parts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 and demonstrate the significance and benefits of the DI tool for a representative set of DL applications. There is a sizable market for Deep Learning of $3.18 Billion/year in 2018, which is expected to grow to $18.16 billion by the end of 2023 according to MarketsandMarkets research. DeepIntrospect has the potential to fundamentally simplify the vast majority of tasks that are being performed by several researchers and scientists across the world. Deep Learning being a relatively new area with ever-changing software libraries and domain-specific hardware presents a unique challenge. Beginners entering the field can end up wasting not only several man-hours but tons of GPU/CPU cycles in training DNNs. DeepIntrospect will allow the beginner scientists and researchers to better align their efforts if they can easily introspect and analyze the behaviour of their model in a simplified fashion. For advanced users and program/product managers, it is more about offloading the cumbersome parts of performance monitoring and analysis to developers and scientists. DeepIntrospect will greatly increase developer/scientists productivity thereby helping the senior/middle management to focus more on design and marketing of DL products and less on low-level details."

Such a technology has the potential to greatly improve the biobanking and transport infrastructure of healthcare for on-demand cells and tissues, improved mass trauma care and advanced personalized medical procedures. Biopreservation is required in regenerative medicine at nearly all levels in the acquisition of source material, isolation, storage and shipment of a final product to patient. Yet critically, the field lacks the ability to safely and efficiently preserve these tissues and medicines while maintaining high cell viability and function after cryopreservation, severely limiting product shelf life. Nowhere is the absence of a biobanking technology more palpable than organ transplantation, where the time window between donor and recipient (4-7 hours) is not enough to properly match donations, screen for pathogens, or transport long distances. Enabling the United States to safely bank organs at subzero temperature will significantly enhance national healthcare. The US faces strong commercial and competitiveness reasons to invest in all facets of regenerative medicine, including organ therapies. Cryopreservation solutions would indirectly enable significant savings to the healthcare system, the patient, and healthcare insurance companies with the cost savings from regenerative medicine treatments estimated to be nearly $250 billion per year in the U.S. The cytotoxicity of current biopreservation techniques is largely associated with inefficient cryoprotective agent and water delivery across the cell membrane during cooling leading to irreparable cell damage from ice formation. Phase I established a fundamentally different approach to cryoprotective agent (CPA) optimization by developing first-in-the-field bioinspired nanopores as transmembrane mega highways to facilitate safe and efficient intracellular delivery and removal of cryoprotective agents during cryopreservation and dramatically increase post-thaw cell yield, viability, and function. The pore-formers assist CPA loading at reduced temperatures to make up the functional loss of biological protein channels at cold temperatures, reduce the amount of CPA required to remarkably low concentrations, and expand the selectable range of CPAs, all while dynamically dissociating at physiological temperature to prevent open-pore toxicity. Further R&D effort will diversify molecular design, optimize lead molecules, scale-up production, and perform cryopreservation studies on regenerative medicines of major therapeutic significance such as stem cells and complex tissues. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The use of cryoprotective agents (CPAs) like DMSO is hindered by their innate cytotoxicity and unfavorable effects in patients infused with DMSO containing HSCs. Opportunity lies in the development of a highly effective CPA or media system that significantly reduces or removes the use of harmful CPAs from cryoprotectant solutions. A cutting-edge preservation method and protocol is needed.Biomedical applications of hydrogels are ever growing with the advancement of antibiotic and traumatic wound care, time and location specific drug delivery, tissue engineering scaffolds, cell preservation, etc.X-Therma has engineered an advanced biomimetic cryoprotective matrix system for eventual use in bone marrow preservation. Phase I will focus on feasibility studies to assess the inherent cryoprotective effect of the matrix system. CD34+ cells will be encapsulated, subjected to a cryopreservation protocol and rewarming procedure. Simple cell assessment by live/dead and metabolic activity assays will be used to show feasibility."

Such a technology has the potential to changing regenerative healthcare forever. It would change biobanking for on-demand cells and tissues and improve mass trauma care and advanced personalized medical procedures. Biopreservation is required in regenerative medicine at nearly all levels in the acquisition of source material, isolation, storage and shipment of a final product to patient. Yet, critically, the field lacks the ability to safely and efficiently preserve these tissues and medicines severely limiting product shelf life. Nowhere is the absence of a biobanking technology more palpable than organ transplantation, where the time window between donor and recipient (4-7 hours) is not enough to properly match donations, screen for pathogens, or transport distances. More people will die from premature organ failure than cancer. Enabling the United States to safely bank organs at subzero temperature will significantly enhance national healthcare. The US faces strong commercial and competitiveness reasons to invest in all facets of regenerative medicine, including organ therapies. Cryopreservation solutions would indirectly enable significant savings to the healthcare system, the patient, and healthcare insurance companies with the cost savings from regenerative medicine treatments estimated to be nearly $250 billion per year in the U.S. The cytotoxicity of current biopreservation techniques is largely associated with inefficient cryoprotective agent and water delivery across the cell membrane during cooling leading to irreparable cell damage from ice formation. The goal of this project is to establish a fundamentally different approach to cryoprotective agent optimization by developing first-in-the-field bioinspired nanopores as transmembrane mega highways to facilitate safe and efficient intracellular delivery and removal of cryoprotective agents during cryopreservation. Past research has demonstrated the reliability of constructing well-defined nanotubular assemblies via the enforced stacking of shape-persistent macrocycles based on the interplay of multiple hydrogen-bonding, dipole-dipole, and aromatic pi-pi stacking interactions and their self-insertion into lipid bilayers. These rationally designed organic nanopores will serve as selective transmembrane channels when protein channels malfunction at or below 3 Â°C. As a result, the cell's exposure time to reach ice-free cryopreservation temperature will be significantly reduced. Post-preservation cell yield and viability will be greatly improved by reducing intracellular ice formation. Upon rewarming, these organic nanopores will facilitate rapid removal of the cryoprotective agents. At physiological temperature, the nanopores will seal off, and be washed out from the system resulting in low toxicity. Nanopore function and effect will be examined using liposome-based glucose transport, cell-based toxicity and cell-based cryopreservation assays."

This lack of a hyper-effective and safe alternative leads to wide spread use of toxic cryoprotectants.Preventing ice remains a physical and chemical problem and innovative cryoprotectants can be realized using new chemistries. In Phase I, we developed a fundamentally different approach to cryoprotectant discovery and our first low-toxicity biomimetic antifreeze that is chemically stable at a variety of temperatures (-196C to 250C), hundreds of times more effective, and far less toxic at effective concentration.In Phase II, we will examine these properties in greater detail while developing our commercial storage solutions to protect cells and tissues.

Some of these changes include electrode expansion, electrode ruffling, dendrite formation, internal gas formation, and internal density changes. A key characteristic of these changes is that most of them occur prior to any external measurable parameter variation, such as in terminal voltage, surface temperature, or mechanical surface strain. Therefore, detecting internal cell structural and mechanical changes early and with adequate resolution has several benefits, including the prevention of catastrophic accidents sufficiently ahead of time, and the gathering of additional information that can be used to more accurately assess the health and life of cells during operation.

However, a primary challenge in this immature process is the lack of knowledge and controlling of the microstructure formation and evolution through this method, especially for the in-process interface between layers where defects are likely to be generated. Although after-process destructive inspection may provide information about the grainrsquo;s microstructure for the additively manufactured part, the after-process characterization does not reveal critical in situ information and thus the possibility for in situ correction. Therefore, any means to measure surface and buried defects in situ efficiently with a high spatial resolution would be highly desirable. To address this critical need, X-wave Innovations, Inc. (XII) proposes to develop an innovative optical-thermal-thermosonic-infrared (OTTI) imaging technology for the nondestructive, in-process inspection of critical flaws both on the layer surface and inside the welded build. The proposed NDE technique builds on the XII-developed multi-frequency thermosonic infrared technology, which is capable of detection of defects as small as micron-size. Combined with the optical and thermal imaging techniques, OTTI reveals unprecedented information in situ on defect formation between layers and microstructure evolution on the layers, which can lead to further in situ correction and control for the structure and quality of the building part during the additive manufacturing process.nbsp;"

While popular, such techniques pose operational safety risks as well as security risks due to the use of radioisotopic materials. Therefore, the DOE has a goal of reducing dependence on commercial and industrial radioactive materials for nuclear nonproliferation. The DOE and the Office of Proliferation Detection is therefore interested in advanced technology solutions to replace inspection techniques that use radiological sources. The developed technology must adopt non-radioisotopic alternative techniques to perform inspections in a reliable, cost-effective and safe manner. To address this critical need, X-wave Innovations, Inc., teaming up with TechOpp Consulting, Inc., proposes an advanced full matrix capture ultrasonic imaging and inspection suite using ultrasonic phased array (UPA) technology, accompanied by software tools to analyze and interpret acquired ultrasonic imaging data. The key innovations in this proposal include the use of an array of ultrasonic sensors to perform inspections, in the implementation of advanced inspection techniques to enable detection of all manner of material defects, and in the development of analysis and interpretation algorithms to create an uncomplicated inspection suite that is easy to operate and get results from. UPA systems combine several ultrasonic transducers in a single probe, and each constituent transducer can be setup to act as ultrasonic transmitter and receiver independently or in synchrony with other transducers to query a three-dimensional material region. The UPA will be used for full matrix capture (FMC), where each transducer is activated in sequence while every transducer acts as receiver. Through this arrangement, multiple sets of responses are acquired by each sensor corresponding to the slightly different paths traveled by the sound waves. The acquired responses will be time shifted, weighted and combined using the Total Focusing Method (TFM) to artificially âfocusâ the ultrasonic waves successively at each point within the material, and use the resultant response to estimate the presence and extent of flaws at each point. During the Phase I program, we will build a prototype sensor hardware and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. We will implement the full matrix capture data acquisition technique for inspecting test specimens. We will develop algorithms to analyze and combine the numerous ultrasonic signals acquired in different configurations. This process is meant to superpose the ultrasonic signals to simulate their focusing in different parts of the test specimen, thus allowing accurate inspection of all regions. We will also develop tools to present analysis results.The proposed project has a clear path to transition into commercial applications. The proposed technology replaces radiographic methods and is inherently safe and secure, thus reducing additional operational expenses associated with additional security and safety precautions associated with radio-isotopic techniques. The proposed technology is capable of detecting various different flaws, is reliable and robust in all environs, and easy to setup and operate. The combination of these qualities presents an attractive proposition to prospective customers. We therefore envision that the proposed full matrix capture ultrasonic imaging based inspection system will be widely applicable in different scenarios. XII is in a unique position to promote and introduce this new technology, thanks to our established partnerships with prime contractors and market leaders in the defense community and the commercial sector. XII will initiate commercialization efforts by working closely with our partners, and we will leverage our connections and actively engage with market leaders to push through the technology transition and commercialization."

Nuclear systems are used in power generation, defense and national security. With such, there is demand of sensor which can help in reliably running the nuclear system and prevent catastrophe. In high radiation field, most of the sensor systems show degradation and under failure, therefore reliability of sensor performance is always in question. In this regard, Department of Energy (DOE) has shown interest and grown support in the improvements and advancement of advanced sensors and instrumentations which can directly support existing power reactors, material test reactors and other similar systems. The desired technology should demonstrate greater accuracy, reliability, resilience and ease of replacement and upgrades for applications in nuclear environments. X-wave Innovations, Inc. (XII), along with TechOpp Consulting Inc. (TOC), proposes to develop a Radiation Endurance Ultrasonic Transducer (REUT) for nuclear applications. The proposed REUT development is based on selecting radiation resilient materials, material engineering and harnessing knowledge of acoustic propagation in materials. The key innovation of the proposed REUT approach lays in the development of metal backing for ultrasonic transducers whose electrical and acoustic characteristics will be comparable to the conventional ultrasonic transducers. Our approach combines the concepts of material engineering and acoustic propagation in materials, are exploited to its best in REUT design, delivering a ultrasonic transducer which is resilient to radiation and can operate in other harsh conditions such as high temperatures. In Phase I, XII will revive the REUT development and perform detail design studies using simulations and precision machining task to develop REUT system with performance characteristics matching the conventional ultrasonic transducers. The primary consideration will be given to the development of backing material which is the heart of the REUT. The performance testing will involve evaluation of REUT working and comparison studies with the available commercial ultrasonic transducers. Improvement in the REUT design will be made based on the performance tests and comparison studies. XII counts with the necessary technical and scientific expertise to carry on a detail analytical and simulation-based design as well as implementing the design in development of a sensor prototype meeting all specification and requirements. We envision the success of the end product and a strong intellectual property portfolio.XII has a clear transitioning plan for the proposed technology. The outcome of the proposed work is an ultrasonic transducer which will have a high tolerance and extended life in high temperatures, and other harsh conditions including extreme radiation. The specially designed ultrasonic transducer can be replacing with the conventional ultrasonic transducers which usually have short performance life span in harsh conditions. The potential application of the proposed technology is in nuclear industry, such as, nuclear reactors (both domestic and military), nuclear waste management, nuclear war heard, handling radioactive materials used national security, medicine and research. The proposed technology can find application in non-nuclear field as well, such as, chemical processing, metal industry, refinery, oil & petroleum industry, charge particle accelerators etc. We anticipate the social and economic benefits of the proposed system are enormous."

Our approach enhances the safety and prognostics associated with lithium-ion batteries, and its reconstruction capability has the added benefit of rejuvenating a cell to extend its life. Finally, the proposed solution will be implemented on small, low cost, and low power hardware to ensure its seamless integration to existing commercial cells and systems."

Most existing quality assurance methods involve an inspection of the finished part rather than online quality control, leaving a need for an online inspection system that can assist in the amelioration of flaws during the manufacturing process. Thus, a monitoring method to optimize the manufacturing process, increase part quality and reduce time/energy spent on post-process quality control/remanufacture is highly desirable. In this proposal, X-wave Innovations, Inc.

The end result of ACUAS is to provide high- resolution ultrasonic images of AM part properties which are subsequently used to augment the AM process control parameters (e.g. laser speed/power) resulting in the compensation of manufacturing defects. In Phase I, XII will prototype a system and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed ACUAS technique for in-situ, measurement and feedback control of powder bed AM process. The focus of the Phase I program will be the overall ACUAS system design and prototyping, including design of the transducer array, signal/image processing algorithms, derived measurement of part properties, and feedback control strategies. The proposed ACUAS provides a means of measuring, and compensating defects formed in parts resulting from a powder bed AM process. The enabling technique will allow a fundamental understanding of the relationship between process parameters, and the formation of defects, as well as a means of ameliorating those defects so that they do not lead to failure of the finalized components. Thus, the proposed ACUAS system will have a significant impact on many industrial and military applications, as AM is being adopted rapidly in nearly all fields. Of particular interest to the DOE, would be the application of ACUAS in the AM of polycrystalline diamond compact drill bits for oil and gas exploration/extraction, or in the production of gas turbine fuel injectors."

Lithium-based batteries will continue to play a key role as an electric propulsion source due to their high energy and power densities. However, the requirement to advance towards more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly aircrafts demands battery systems that can operate for longer periods of time in a safer and more reliable manner. Efforts within the commercial aviation sector also indicate strong interest in this area. As an example, Boeing is developing hybrid airplanes as part of the Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft project funded by NASA, and has also developed the first hybrid electric airplane in cooperation with Cambridge University. On the battery monitoring and control area, focus has been mostly aimed at achieving accurate and stable long-term estimation of cell State of Charge, State of Health, and Remaining Useful Life. These efforts have achieved excellent progress, and accuracies below 3% error are common today.

The overall envelope dimensions and locations of interface fittings and attachment elements such as lacing ferrules and hanger baskets are critical to the proper function and durability of the fuel cells. The existing method of dimensional inspection is to install the fuel cells in a facsimile structure and evaluate the fit of the cell within the facsimile structure.

In this proposal, X-wave Innovations, Inc. (XII) propose a handheld, non-contact, three-dimensional (3D) measurement system (called SnapSCAN). The SnapSCAN utilizes a unique design based on our 3D scanner that has a MEMS laser projector and a split lens 3D sensor, allowing much faster and accurate measurements than any other handheld devices on the market. The key innovation of the proposed SnapSCAN is the integration of 3 state-of-the-art technologies (including 3D scanning and measurement technology, MEMS laser color image projection technology, and ultra compact computer technology) into one compact, handheld device. It is a true standalone system that requires neither additional assistant component for 3D data stitching, dedicated computer for calculation, nor wired power supply. It can replace two different gauges on the market: Protrusion/Flushness Gauge (Analog or Digital) and Countersink Gauge (Analog or Digital). It can provide high accuracy comprehensive analysis results. The system startup time is only a few seconds. There is no need for any pre-setups such as system calibrations. The measurement time for a fastener can be less than one second. BENEFIT: The key advantage of the proposed handheld SnapSCAN is the non-contact nature, which eliminates the possibilities of damaging the fastener and surrounding surfaces during scanning and measurement, improves accuracy, and eliminates sources of human error. The image guided quick measurement can interactively guide the operator to find the optimal location for the scanner, make measurement and show the results in real-time. By whole surface measurement, it can provide accurate and comprehensive results that are impossible by other tools. The measurement results can be interactively displayed and be instantly saved to local hard drive or to wireless network storages."

The potential outcome of this project is a comprehensive line of robotic ultrasound transducers that enable a variety of interventional point-of-care robotic applications by enhancing the skills of a multitude of clinicians. As a result, many technically challenging critical procedures will no longer be restricted to solely highly trained experts. Applications include central vascular access (pediatric and adult), biopsy, regional anesthesiology, precision extraction (e.g. thoracentesis), and precision injections (e.g. orthopedic biologics), creating an addressable market exceeding $2 billion. Benefits of man-machine teaming using hand-held medical robots include faster, simpler procedures that can be performed by a much broader group of clinicians, reduced medical complications and patient discomfort, and improved hospital infrastructure utilization, ultimately benefitting both clinical outcomes and total costs of care. Significant insights and implications for other man-machine teaming applications may also result from this project, with potential for robotic applications well outside of the medical realm. The intellectual merit of this project centers on demonstrating the feasibility of first-of-kind hand-held robotic capabilities for autonomous needle placement. This project builds on two existing layers of innovation. First is the ability to use real-time ultrasound data to send a needle precisely to a point in the body. This differs significantly from other imaging modalities that require multiple images from different orientations integrated ""off line."" Next, this is an autonomous and powered system. Once a user selects a target, the needle path is calculated and the needle is advanced automatically. This project builds the third level of innovation through its research objectives - creating the real-time ability to i) recognize and track the target as an object, and ii) make automatic robotic corrections to maintain that target during user or patient movement or changes in target characteristics. The research involves novel image recognition and tracking technology and very precise novel sensing and control loop technology that interact in real time to maintain targeting accuracy in a dynamic environment.

In cell culture, they provide for bench top or high throughput screening applicable to gene regulation, pathway discovery, target validation, drug discovery, and cellular target efficacy. Used in vivo with whole animal imaging, they provide for temporal and quantitative analysis of drug delivery and in vivo target efficacy. The most commonly used reporter-gene assays place an easily monitored reporter gene such as a fluorescent protein or luciferase downstream to cloned promoter and transcriptional regulatory elements. In an exogenousreporter, the vector is introduced into recipient cells where expression proceeds either transiently, or after  random  and stable integration into the genome. Exogenous reporter-gene assays are highly unpredictable, and often incapable of indexing geneexpression to known regulatory agents. They can provide erroneous data and mislead research investigations, thereby costing time, expense and unrealized discovery and development opportunities. In contrast, in an endogenous reporter, reporter genes are introduced at their normal chromosomal locus where native promoters, regulatory elements, local chromosomal modifications and micro-RNA regulatory sequences are utilized to reliably and accurately index gene regulation. However, very few endogenous human gene- expression reporter cell assays are available and sensitivity limits accurate monitoring of many genes. Compounding this, current gene trapping and gene targeting methods for producing assays require large investments in resources, time, and cost, making them unattainable for most laboratories. In phase I studies, we propose to combine Xactagen's prior research advances in reporter cell sensitivity with innovative methods to mass produce, store and retrieve endogenous, human gene expression reporter cells. Our hypothesis is that we will have extensive gene coverage, sensitivity to monitor expression of even poorly expressed genes, reliable responses to known gene regulators, and the ability to retrieve specific reporter cells from our libraries for delivery to researchers within 4-6 weeks of ordering. Our specific aims are: (1) Generate a pilot library of 19,200 arrayed gene-trapped reporter cells (NIH-H292 human mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line), (2) Identify vector insertion sites, and characterize gene/transcription unit representation, and (3) Retrieve 10 endogenous reporter cells and verify functionality. This innovative research provides for cost-effective and highly expedited production of human endogenous gene expression reporter cell libraries in weeks as opposed to years. As a result, more researchers will have access to endogenous human reporter cells and will be able to focus on cell culture and in vivo applications, rather than on production. Additionally, researchers can avoid exogenous reporter cells with their unpredictable indexing of gene expression. Ultimately, scientists will make more viable research and medical discoveries in less time and at far less cost. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current methods for production of endogenousgene expression reporter cells are laborious and cost- prohibitive. The ultimate goal of this research i to provide cost-effective and highly expedited production of human endogenous reporter cell libraries - in weeks as opposed to years. Hundreds of thousands of readily available, highly sensitive, easy to use, and affordable gene expression reporter cells produced in diverse human cell lines and stem cells are expected to increase productivity of scientific research and drug discovery."

Accordingly, approaches to slow AD progression are designed to prevent central nervous system (CNS) accumulation of Aa, either by pharmacological inhibition of its synthesis or by development of Aa vaccines and antibodies that augment clearance of Aa by microglia. Moreover, a secondary event in disease pathology results from release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and neurotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) by microglia in response to activation by Aa. Although several drug discovery approaches show promise in suppressing Aa ??accumulation, drug candidates derived from many of these approaches have side effects that remain problematic. In this SBIR study, we will discover agents which target unexploited pathways to both promote the reduction of Aa in AD brain and suppress the associated neuroinflammation. Specifically, we will: 1) Develop high throughput assays using human microglial cell lines to measure Aa phagocytosis and screen small molecule libraries of known drugs, bioactives and drug-like compounds to discover compounds that promote Aa phagocytosis, 2) Develop assays to measure production of mediators of neuroinflammation and test whether compounds found to augment Aa phagocytosis can suppress production of Aa induced mediators of neuroinflammation in human microglial cell lines and primary human microglia, and 3) Compounds found to augment Aa induced phagocytosis and suppress Aa induced mediators of neuroinflammation in cell culture are tested for their ablility to induce primary human microglia to clear Aa from clinically relevant post-mortem brain tissues obtained from AD patients. After completion of this Phase I project, the necessary AD assays, proof of concept for small molecule intervention, and required expertise for additional studies will be in place for identification and optimization of lead drug candidates in Phase II. Project In the United States, 4.5 million people have Alzheimer's Disease (AD) where direct and indirect costs of care are estimated at $100 billion annually.

This will in turn result in the creation of lower cost for unique and small batch parts thereby reducing overall cost in these critical areas. Presently very slow print speed is a universal concern for 3D printing processes. By substantially speeding up the 3D process and reducing the amount of waste, the economic break-even point, where the cost of 3D printing equals the cost of plastic injection molding, is reached for a much smaller number of parts. The system cost is also expected to be similar or less than the system cost of present 3D systems while the materials cost is comparable to present methods since very similar powdered thermoplastic materials are used. The extremely high process speeds achievable with this innovative technology, coupled with the fact that this approach will work with full color thermoplastic materials, makes this a potential game changer for additive manufacturing. This project uses the technology found in office laser printers. This technology has never been used before in rapid prototyping systems. There have been previous attempts to harness laser printing technology but they have all found it difficult to make parts thicker than about a quarter inch. This project is a radical innovation in the application of the technology in that it separates two critical functions, transfer and consolidation, that have always been combined in previous attempts to use the technology. This innovation enables much greater control of both functions in a way that resolves the problem of building thicker parts by making the process look much more like that used in a laser printer. The innovation also allows the 3D printing of parts to be up to five times faster than any existing method. The anticipated technical result is to build multi-layer blocks of material quickly and uniformly layer by layer. The process does also include the capability to support parts during build.

It is based on a major breakthrough achieved at Xacton. This has led to the fabrication of wafers of Mercury Cadmium Telluride with a very high level of crystalline perfection, very low defect density and extremely uniform in composition, wavelength and other properties. This has resulted in the fabrication of sensors with unmatched performance at elevated temperatures, including room temperature operation. Some of the disadvantages of the Cryo-coolers are that they have only a limited lifetime, are not very reliable, and are heavy and expensive. Therefore, their elimination in the space-based surveillance systems can make the system much simpler to design and fabricate, with increased reliability and lifetime, and also result in considerable cost reduction. In Phase I, we plan to fabricate and deliver 3 - 5 micron detectors with excellent performance at elevated temperatures, e.g., 30C to -70C. In Phase II, it will lead to the fabrication of sensors that can be used in actual Space-Based Surveillance Systems without the use of ryo-coolers or uncooled."

Xage Security Fabric provides a multi-vendor security fabric for role-based access control for connected grid infrastructure (RTUs, automated switches and relays) saving time and money for IT, OT administrators, and field technicians while also providing a higher level of protection against a cyberattack or potential compromise. The Xage Security Fabric is an overlay to the utilityâs or vendors security and operational infrastructure and provides unified identity based access management by synthesizing security policies centrally while distributing the enforcement functions at the industrial edge. This end to end zero trust methodology allows near real-time policy updates allowing operations to onboard crews from other utilities who need local login access for restoration efforts. With this approach, credential management and authentication is managed and enforced in the fabric instead of the various field laptops and eliminates poor security practices associated with unmanaged credentials or open access to last mile grid devices. Demonstrate an identity based security fabric for unified access control that provides a central policy manager and decentralized enforcement for unified access management and authentication. Develop a secure communication subsystem fabric endpoint with the ability to receive and securely store credentials at the infrastructure edge (pole mounted devices) enabling field technician (inclusive of auxiliary crews) secure access and audits. The benefit of this project is significant across a number of stakeholder groups, including the overall public. Utilities will be able to adopt a zero trust OT model to manage security enforcement controls across the entire distribution grid infrastructure and enforce access control policies consistently which creates a more cyber resilient grid. The security fabric concept for OT will allow utilities to provide more cost effective protection to their infrastructure in a way that still allows for choice in suppliers, reduction in IT infrastructure, capital and operational expenditures allowing for increased investment in modernization efforts for the overall public."

The current electrical grid is transforming from a centralized design to one that is decentralized, transactional and includes many more stakeholders from a consumer and generation standpoint. Xage Security Fabric technology provides a blockchain protected security fabric for any to any information exchange for devices, apps, people and data required to secure this distributed grid architecture while also securing legacy assets already deployed. These legacy assets typically have poor to no security controls and are becoming more connected to industrial IoT infrastructures creating attack vectors for nation states and nefarious actors. The public benefit is to prevent the disruption of energy services by securing the nationâs critical infrastructure from foreign and domestic enemies planning cyber attacks. This approach reduces costs for grid operations through business and operational process transformation, preserving investment in deployed infrastructure, and promoting interoperability between systems. A secondary benefit to the public can be realized though reduced utility costs often filed as part of a rate base by the utility, as well as, enabling adoption of distributed generation by securing advanced peer to peer control software to support the introduction of microgrids and other distributed generation infrastructure. The proposed project will demonstrate and characterize how the characteristics of a blockchain based application can provide security for legacy and modern grid assets by creating identities and controlling access to assets from multiple vendors. The enforcement of policies created and secured in the blockchain will include both center to edge and distributed peer to peer interactions between devices and applications using common industrial protocols. A solution does not exist today that offers a combination of these capabilities. A scalability study will also be conducted to characterize performance and attributes needed for a decentralized blockchain architecture if deployed in a typical distribution grid. Todayâs security methodology and tools used in both information and operational technology are built on the premise of connectivity to a central location and centralized control. The distributed nature of blockchain technology makes a decentralized security model possible at significant scale. The security use cases demonstrated by this project will address Industry 4.0 innovations that rely on industrial control systems becoming more connected and autonomous.

Some of the more interesting applications of these networks depend on the ability to produce entanglement in a form that enables the implementation of teleportation and entanglement swapping protocols. In the absence of quantum memories, this requires the production of entanglement in tight time windows that enables the execution of joint measurements among photons from independent sources. This project aims to develop a high-quality pulsed source that avoids the use of large lasers typically used in teleportation and entanglement swapping demonstrations. The existence of such a source will be important for the establishment of long-distance quantum networks, particularly for eventual satellite applications. SQT will use its existing CubeSat format entanglement source as a starting point for developing this pulsed, low SWaP entanglement source."

To share symmetric encryption keys between two remote ground stations, the satellite can create separate keys at the two sites, then reconcile the keys between them. This implies that the satellite needs to know both keys, making it a trusted node. Ultimate security is achieved by simultaneously creating keys using two quantum channels from a satellite, known as double downlink QKD. This is the ultimate in security because the satellite does not need to be trusted.

The resulting products will allow customers to perform a rich range of tests at the nano-scale at costs and times that are a small fraction of those required for conventional platforms such as scanning electron microscopes (SEM), scanning probe microscopes (SPM), and a range of automated test equipment (ATE) based on these technologies. Miniaturization across a range of sectors is driving the development of devices and materials at increasingly minute length scales. Multiple large-scale trends including mobile devices and the internet-of-things are driving an unprecedented volume of engineering at the nanoscale. Much of this is now dependent on the single-tip SPM that has evolved into a broad array of instruments for the analysis of physical, chemical and electrical properties, and to detect and isolate flaws. The Multiple Integrated Tips (MiT) technology that is the focus of this effort takes a radically different approach to enable an even richer range of tests at length scales below one micron, with a faster, simpler and much more cost-effective platform. Given a large install-base of capital equipment, we are focused on probes coupled with adapters that plug into the most popular SEMs and SPMs. These probes significantly expand the functionality of existing systems, and do this with low barriers to acceptance given modest price points and seamless integration into standard industry platforms. A portfolio of probes will be developed to address high-volume needs across the semiconductor and thin film markets, starting with 4-tip devices for the electrical characterization of thin films, and configurable or non-configurable 3-4-tip devices for probing integrated circuits. These will be offered in a variety of sizes and geometries, currently from hundreds of nm to 65 nm, and extending below 10 nanometers within a year. In Phase II, probe functionality will be enhanced to enable coupled imaging and probing with design to operate in AFM mode. The portfolio of products will be continuously expanded to additional two- and three-dimensional geometries via co-development with lighthouse customers."

The underlying motivating factor stems from a lack of testing equipment with high resolution and sensitivity necessary for identifying faults as the semiconductor industry shrinks feature sizes to 10 nanometers and beyond. Successful development and use of the integrated device will allow engineers to understand the root cause of failure mechanisms of solid state devices at these advanced nodes. The commercial impact of this new capability for failure analysis on next-generation devices will be profound. The miniaturization of semiconductor devices has led to a decrease in the cost per transistor of seven orders of magnitude in the last 40 years, and new process and measurement technologies are needed to continue this trend. The reduction of transistor size enables high performance devices at a lower cost and lower power. The proposed multiple tip technology will enable the development of these advanced-node highly scaled transistors that will form the platform for the next generation of high-performance electronic devices such as personal computers, cell phones, and healthcare equipment. The intellectual merit of this project is the use of monolithically integrated scanning probes to facilitate the extension of semiconductor failure analysis to devices with feature sizes of ten nanometers or less. Crucially, conventional characterization and test methods are increasingly ineffective when applied to structures smaller than 100 nanometers, causing challenges for engineers in research and development, process control and failure analysis. Subtle defects become increasingly prominent drivers of failure as device size and operating margins decrease, e.g., processing anomalies in thin gate oxides, substrate problems related to doping, and line width variations. These issues can occur at length scales invisible to traditional scanning electron microscopy and optical-based tools, requiring novel approaches. The proposed multiple integrated tip devices leverage powerful nano-electro-mechanical capabilities and scale well even below 10 nanometers. In addition, cost effectiveness of the nanofabrication techniques, combined with monolithic integration of sensing structures and tailoring of the tips would enable robust, high-volume testing, a key need for the semiconductor industry. Research objectives include the fabrication of nanoscale multiple integrated tip devices, atomic force imaging of transistors and active electrical characterization of transistors. The anticipated result is accurate electrical characterization of transistor performance using the multiple integrated tip device."

The problem lies in the numerous parameters that can be used to identify the origin. To resolve this and meet its need, Xallent LLC proposes developing a database of unique device parameters and characteristics that can be used to successfully track the origin of fabrication of an electronic component. This identification process will be streamlined by focusing on distinct parameters such as the charge transport mechanism in transistor channel, induced strain around Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) structures, and dielectric integrity in Metal-Insulator-Metal capacitors. Physical observables such as via and STI etch angle profiles as well as transistor architecture will also be documented. The measurements from a novel multiple tip Scanning Probe System, invented and constructed by Xallent LLC, capable of performing Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Tip Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) and Nanoscale-Transconductance characterization, will then be used to evaluate the parameters. As a result, the work done in Phase I will entail the first time an integrated system is used for sequential atomic imaging, TERS and Nanoscale-Transconductance measurement in ambient air without the assistance of a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)."

XT-101 is a non-viral form of gene therapy that causes the meningeal cells surrounding the spinal cord to secrete the powerful, natural, anti- inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10). Based on extensive pre-clinical research, Xalud believes that the secreted IL-10 will reduce inflammation and normalize the pathological microglia and astrocyte activity that is seen in MS. Xalud proposes to study XT-101 in both inflammatory and neurodegenerative rodentmodels of MS and to conduct various cell and tissue analyses to better understand and elucidate the biological effects of XT-101. Xalud expects to demonstrate in these models that XT-101 reduces motor impairment, alleviates gait disorders and resolves neuropathic pain. Xalud also expects that XT-101 will have a positive effect on numerous elements of MS pathology including: immune cell infiltration, inflammation, reduced glutamate transport, demyelination, and neuronal apoptosis. Support of the proposed studies would greatly accelerate the development of XT-101 for clinical applications. Xalud is currently conducting IND-enabling toxicology studies for the use of XT-101 in neuropathic pain and expects to file an IND in late 2013. The additional efficacy dataprovided by the proposed studies would support the initiation of human trials of XT-101 in neuropathic pain, gait disorders and possibly other MS-related indications. Xalud believes that XT-101, if successfully developed, could have a tremendous impact onthe clinical treatment of MS and greatly improve the quality of life MS patients. Neuropathic pain and gait disorders impact almost all MS patients and greatly reduce their ability to participate in society and enjoy life. Further, XT-101 may slow diseaseprogression in the currently untreatable progressive forms of MS. Because the method of action of XT-101 is markedly different from all existing or imminent MS treatments, it has the potential to be an extremely useful addition and complement to current medical practice.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Xalud Therapeutics, Inc. is seeking support to advance the development of XT-101 for the treatment of motor impairment, gait disorders and neuropathic pain associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). Currently, there are no treatments approved for MS-related neuropathic pain or for treating progressive forms of the disease and only one treatment approved for gait disorders. By addressing these areas of tremendous unmet clinical need,Xalud believes XT-101 can greatly improve the quality of life of MS patients."

The system uses radio tomography (RT), i.e., the changes in radio signal strength (RSS) measurements on the static links of the network over time, to localize and track stationary and moving targets. In a wooded environment, a major challenge is represented by the environmental noise, i.e., the changes in RSS introduced by e.g. wind and rain. In this project, we will demonstrate noise reduction algorithms capable of learning the characteristics of the environmental noise and filtering it from the collected RSS signals. This allows the system to detect a person crossing a link line despite the environmental noise. Moreover, in remote wooded areas, the battery-powered RF sensors composing the system must function for an extended period of time (e.g., one year). We will address the issue of power efficiency first by developing a self-synchronizing communication protocol which enables radio duty-cycling. Second, the system will adaptively adjust the sampling (i.e., communication) rate of the sensors depending on the detection of significant events (i.e., intrusions of people in the monitored area). We will test large-scale deployments of RF sensors in wooded areas and process the collected data off-line to demonstrate the ability of our RT system to accurately track people as they move through the deployment area."

This project will develop new technologies that make the system useful for police team end-users to quickly deploy and use without extensive training. Specifically, the produce should investigate methods to achieve robust connectivity across larger buildings; develop capabilities for 2.5-dimensional (x,y + floor) imaging and tracking; develop adaptive estimation algorithms that automatically adjust to the environment; develop devices suited for rapid deployment, and develop a real-time commercial prototype including user interface. At the end of the project, the combination of these developments should allow delivery of a prototype to a SWAT team for them to deploy and use on their own in a training exercise. The broader/commercial impact is the commercialization of a technology for police and SWAT (special weapons and tactics) teams to quickly obtain situational intelligence that will save lives. Lives are lost every year because law enforcement officers do not know what is happening inside a building prior to entering. In addition, other life-saving applications will benefit from technologies developed, for example: military urban operations; building security and homeland security systems; finding people alive in collapsed buildings or during fire rescue; and worker safety systems. The firms technology is also useful in systems that allow elderly to live longer in their own home by monitoring their activities to ensure their safety and health. The proposed solution to these challenges is uniquely useful because it does not require a person to wear or carry any device, and cannot image a person's face or features, thus preserving privacy. The technology is capable of ""seeing"" through walls, even in the dark or through smoke.

The sensor is contact-free, i.e., a person does not need to remember to wear it in order to be monitored. The system monitors links for changes in signal strength which indicate a person being near the line between two transceivers. Algorithms use the link information to infer the location of a person. With transceivers at two different heights, algorithms can distinguish whether a person is standing, sitting, or laying on the floor, and use the speed at which someone moves to the floor to detect a dangerous fall. Room-level tracking can also be used to look for unusual patterns which indicate physical or cognitive decline. This project will develop methods to minimize deployment time and expertise. It will develop novel algorithms that allow for a lower density of transceivers in the system, and still achieve room-level tracking and fall detection accuracy. Live demonstrations will be conducted with potential investors and customers. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the ability for the sensor to increase the ability of an elder to safely age-in-place in their preferred living environment, benefitting them and reducing the costs of nursing home care. Unfortunately, many older people fall each year, often when alone, resulting in long delays before help arrives. The fear of falling and being unable to get help is a reason many enter nursing care. Older adults at risk for cognitive decline (e.g., dementia) could live independently longer with sensing systems that help caregivers monitor their well-being. Beyond aging-in-place, these technologies have application in hospitals; smart-building systems for automation and energy efficiency; security systems; retail analytics; and generally for context- and location- aware computing applications. Existing technologies use (1) wearable sensors, which are often forgotten, (2) video camera surveillance, which is seen as too invasive of privacy, or (3) infrared motion sensors, which do not detect falls and are prone to false alarms. In contrast, the proposed sensor does not need to be worn, reliably senses falls, and is privacy-preserving. Our sensor provides capabilities currently unavailable, and will be bought by aging-in-place monitoring and system integrator companies."

DFL locates people inside of a building using only simple radio devices deployed on the outside of the building. In a police or military operation, these devices are thrown or launched around the building, and then measure the received signal strength (RSS) between many pairs of devices. Within seconds of deployment, the DFL system shows a map tracking people and objects within the building. Such a system requires rapid deployment techniques and real-time operator-free network configuration. This project will advance the state-of-the-art in self-configuring and adaptive wireless networks. Methods for using reconfigurable antennas to direct the antenna pattern through the building regardless of how a sensor lands will be developed. For operator-free deployment, the network will have devices which self-localize, and learn the statistics of the particular radio channels to be measured. The combined results will show that tactically deployed wireless devices can be used to rapidly obtain intelligence regarding occupants before entering a dangerous building. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project are significant, as lives are lost every year because law enforcement officers do not know what is happening on the other side of a wall. If successful, this project will enable a product for police/SWAT and military special operations forces (SOF) which will save lives by providing actionable intelligence prior to entering a dangerous building. Existing radar technology for through-wall imaging is too expensive ($100k) for all but the most cost-insensitive applications. We plan a product that, because of its low cost, small size, and ease of use, will be standard equipment in police departments and in SOF teams.

Existing nanofiber technologies simultaneously produce at low throughputs and apply NFs at very slow line speeds (~1-30 m/min) as a low basis weight surface coating onto nonwoven substrates. Due to the inefficient delivery and high costs of NFs, they are commercially only used in high-end applications in filtration, acoustics, medical, energy and textiles. By separately producing bulk NFs and developing methods to efficiently spray them at high rates (>150 m/min) inline, the significant value of NF?s can be more widely applied to the US nonwovens manufacturing sector. The key research objectives include developing methods to disperse NFs for wet or dry spraying, determining how to spray NFs using commercially available equipment, and testing the value that sprayed nanofibers add to air filtration and acoustic nonwoven products. It is anticipated that methods to spray and disperse NFs will be developed and pilot spraying equipment design requirements will be determined as a result of this research. The broader impact / commercial potential of this project could unleash the high value that NFs can add to nonwoven products by spraying bulk, short-length polymeric nanofibers (NFs) inline at full line speeds (>150 m/min) in nonwoven manufacturing processes using commercially-available spraying hardware. The NF spraying equipment would be a fraction of the hardware costs compared to existing electrospinning and melt blowing NF technologies. Recently a novel transformative NF closed-loop chemical production process has been scaled up and it addresses a fundamental limitation of current NF processes ? high throughput off-line production of short length NFs. Spraying nanofibers at full nonwoven line speeds would accelerate the growth rate (estimated at 34% per year) of the existing $176 million market for nanofibers. In the $6.6 billion air filtration market, this novel NF spraying technology will be a key to improving filter efficiency and lowering costs through new improved products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The first target markets for spraying nanofibers in-line will be for air filtration and acoustics applications. The broader impact of developing nanofiber spraying capabilities will make the US nonwoven industry more competitive worldwide and improve North Carolina?s economy through job creation."

Additive manufacturing (AM) offers the potential to realize the production of monolithic components while significantly reducing investments of resources including time, effort, and money. This project will target AM of large, complex 3D structures made of metal and alloy. At present, there is little data on high-vacuum properties of such build products. This deficit inhibits the use of direct energy deposition (DED) processes, which are well suited for rapid builds of large 3D products. Resolving this fundamental technology gap is a key factor motivating this effort. Numerous research and development (R&D) applications, both within fusion science and in other fields, require production of high-vacuum compatible components made of metals and alloys. Additive manufacturing can improve, over traditional methods, the fabrication and performance of the components. It (a) enables production of a 3D geometry as a single component from a 3D CAD model, (b) enables structures that can't be built with traditional methods, and (c) offers the potential to more rapidly and cost effectively realize a complex structure. Our aim is to leverage capabilities of cutting-edge hybrid-DED AM, to: advance processes capable of rapid and economical 3D builds of metals and alloys; develop, identify, and experimentally qualify single refractory metal and metal alloy build formulas suitable for high-vacuum applications, using components fabricated using arc/laser wire-fed/powder-fed DED processes; and merge the compilation into solutions enabling AM of high-vacuum chambers and components."

Transimpedance amplifiers (TIA) are widely utilized in experimental and commercial applications for this task. Numerous detection systems require wide bandwidth, ultra-low noise, high gain, and linear amplification. Commercial TIAs having this combination of features are surprisingly not readily available and many consumers resort to costly and time consuming in-house development. We propose to develop ultra-low noise, wide bandwidth, high gain, transimpedance amplifiers (TIA). This will be achieved via the development of an Advanced-TIA Platform - a circuit designed (using surface mount technology) to achieve linear amplification of current 1 nA, signal bandwidth 5 MHz (-3dB), equivalent input-noise ~ 1.5 nA (rms), and transimpedance (gain) 107 V/A. This exacting set of specifications is not readily available in commercial products. It will, furthermore, have the capacity to be adapted to a range of specifications, enabling custom performance metrics to be fulfilled. This platform will be developed into a Plug-and-Play device that is compact and vacuum-grade; attributes that are beneficial to scientific R & amp;D applications. During the Phase-I period we developed a circuit that established the feasibility of our Advanced-TIA concept; we accomplished this by computer modeling the circuit, evaluating its performance, prototyping the device and demonstrating its performance. During Phase-II we will mature the Advanced-TIA circuit into a Platform and construct the Plug-and-Play device. This significance of this effort is captured in the following: 1) It will result in novel TIA products suitable for communication, science, and service industries within government and private sector markets; 2) It has broad inherent value within the scientific R & amp;D sector and is likely to attract future development funding; 3) Other benefits to the federal and private scientific R & amp;D programs include less time spend on in-house development, cost savings, and greater programmatic productivity."

Current-to-voltage converters (I/Vs) are widely utilized in experimental and commercial applications for this task. Numerous detection systems require wide bandwidth, ultra-low noise, high gain, and linear amplification. Commercial I/Vs having this combination of features are surprisingly not readily available and many consumers resort to costly and time consuming in-house development. These factors, reflected presently within the heavy ion beam probe (HIBP) program supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Fusion Energy Sciences, motivate this effort. We propose to develop ultra-low noise, wide bandwidth, high gain, transimpedance amplifiers (TIA). They emanate from a design developed and used successfully by the HIBP program for over 25 years. Noteworthy characteristics will include linear amplification of current 1 nA, signal bandwidth 1 MHz (-3dB), equivalent input-noise ~ 1.5 nA (rms), and transimpedance (gain) 107 V/A. They will also be compact, vacuum grade (operable at 10-7 torr), and smartly-packaged. Contemporary methods, including computerized circuit modeling and surface-mount technology (SMT), will be used to achieve these state-of-the-art products. This significance of this effort is captured in the following; 1) It will advance heavy ion beam probe diagnostic capabilities, furthering fusion energy science; 2) It will result in novel TIA products suitable for communication, science, and service industries within government and private sector markets; and 3) It has broad inherent value likely to attract future development funding. This work is critical to realization of innovative Heavy Ion Beam Probe detectors and measurements under development within the O.F.E.S Diagnostic Program including: 1) Development of modern detector systems, enabling the HIBP to characterize /n and  electrostatic fluctuation induced transport with greater than prevailing resolution; 2) Incorporation of more populous detector/aperture sets into energy analyzers, enabling the HIBP to achieve a better understanding of wavenumbers (k_nn, k_ and low-k fluctuations; 3) Development of a particle velocity detector, advancing the unique HIBP capability to measure the poloidal magnetic flux (t) and infer the evolution of the current density and q-profiles; 4) Development of wider bandwidth measurements, extending the frequency sensitivity of the HIBP to enable assessment of quantities not currently accessible; and 5) Advancement of HIBP detector technology toward a smaller and more economical alternative to an electrostatic analyzer (an option that may make the HIBP realizable on a larger number of devices). Near term benefits of this work will be realized in the U.S. fusion program domestically (with the HIBP operating on MST) and through an emerging international partnership with the Max-Plank Institute in Germany (and plans to operate HIBPs on ASDEX-U and W7-X). HIBPs having enhanced capabilities will access a wider range of quantities required for validation efforts and have broader impact within the fusion program. The new detection elements and measurements are central to these opportunities and Advanced-TIAs are vital to their success."

The biosensor wouldconsist of a sample lysis and electronic hybridization/release chamber fluidically connected to an electrochemical flow cell for detection, and would incorporate Xanthon's patented platform technology of electrochemical detection of nucleic acids. Withthis method, specific target nucleic acid species captured by oligo capture probes are directly detected by the electrochemical oxidation of guanine, an endogenous component of the nucleic acid targets. This provides a method of rapid, highly sensitive,and specific DNA detection without the need for complicated sample purification procedures, exogenous labels, labile reagents, or expensive, heavy, power-hungry instrumentation. Upon successful demonstration of the feasibility of the basic components,plans for further miniaturization and integration of the components will proceed toward development of a rugged, easy-to-use handheld unit that will take further advantage of the power and simplicity of direct electrochemical detection, in addition to theeconomy of time, space, and reagents made possible by microfluidics and electronic hybridization. In addition to military applications, development of such devices would provide prompt detection of potential bio-terrorist attacks, and find wide applicationfor the detection of pathogens in medical diagnostics, point-of-care clinical settings, food production, environmental monitoring, agriculture, and various industrial settings."

Our overall objective is to design, develop and pilot the prototype of a novel electronic-health record (EHR)-enabled standards-based mobile health information technology to enable earlier, detailed, and continuous identification of SDoH barriers among individuals with cancer; prioritize actionable social needs; incorporate the collected and prioritized SDoH data into the clinical workflow; and facilitate the connection of the individuals to the most relevant and needed community-based organizations and social supportive services to reduce the burden of disease for patients, their families, their physicians and clinical practices. Our technical objectives are (1): Design and prototype a tool that enables the convenient, secure and user-friendly collection of comprehensive data on SDoH from patients via mobile health technology and makes it available as discrete fields within an EHR to drive customized decisions for patients. (2): Integrate the SDoH data with an intelligent community referral system that will serve as a âconnectorâ to match patient needs to social support services and community-based organizations.

adjusted for body surface area (BSA). Unfortunately, while this may be adequate for the average person, it can be inappropriate for the majority of patients. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors are key components contributing to drug toxicities. Variations in metabolic enzyme activity have been shown to be responsible for toxicity in a number of anticancer agents including amonafide. Amonafide showed significant promise in treating metastatic breast cancer in the 1990's. However, unpredictable toxicity produced by N-acetylation limited development. We and others have previously developed dosing nomograms for amonafide in an effort to both reduce toxicity and increase response. In our phase I proposal, we developed a rapid method for NAT2 phenotyping. Here in phase II, we will use this method to develop a new acetylator-based dosing nomogram with individualized dosing levels aimed at the treatment of refractory breast cancer. We will refine our theoretical nomogram by adjusting dosing levels on the basis of myelosuppression. This adjusted dosing nomogram will then be used to select amonafide doses in an 80 patient cohort. Our goal is to demonstrate that our acetylator-based dosing nomogram will minimize variability in toxicity and increase the probability of positive therapeutic outcome."

Given the global ID nature of email addresses, email has become the most popular communication vehicle for document exchange. This approach has four fundamental shortcomings: proliferation of disaggregated versions of documents, lack of security (the email protocol is not encrypted), unreliable delivery of attachments, and expensive growth of email storage and staff support. This project develops an email server filter that strips attachments from messages and stores them on cheaper file servers instead of expensive email storage. Messages (sent or received) can be modified so that each attachment is replaced by a secure link and the attached documents can be tracked and managed. Xapio designed a system architecture and user interfaces that harness the best features of email, web, and file systems: this includes a system that supports shared metadata between files and emails, secure links to permanent objects, and email based authentication, and a set of browser user interfaces that converge the file and email experience. By adding these capabilities to a system, it is possible to deliver all benefits without changing IT infrastructure, install desktop applications, or changing user habits. That is, Users can securely and reliably send any size file to anyone from their email client (i.e. Outlook). Recipients retrieve the files with their email client or any browser. The sender can track downloads. If successful, this project has the potential to significantly impact email cost, security and reliability."

The radiator will be suitable for use on instruments carried by future spacecraft. The phase I effort will address the thermal performance and size limitations of the composite design. Since cryogenic applications are becoming more common the thermal characteristics of the radiator will be measured down to 45K. Modern spacecraft thermal control needs to be low mass and low cost. Composite thermal radiators will realize a greater than 60% weight saving compared to aluminum and the costs can be addressed by the use of standard technology that can be easily applied to new designs. The major innovation to be demonstrated by this project is the use of highly orientated fibers that completely eliminates the low through thickness thermal conductivity normally associated with traditional carbon fiber laminates. This highly oriented lay-up also allows the thickness of the radiator to be tapered down to less than 0.020"" while retaining very high stiffness. Therefore, the radiator is much thinner than the equivalent aluminum radiator, which combined with lower density of composite construction, accounts for the significant weight reduction."

Project Summary The recent advances in pluripotent stem cell (PSC) technology enable researchers to establish human tissue derived cellular platforms for toxicity testing that are capable of providing information on mechanism of action, while facilitating the incorporation of broad genetic diversity and clinically validated disease conditions. We and other investigators have shown that it is possible run neurotoxicity screens with primary cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and obtain consistent and reliable results that offer advantages over screens run in cell lines or in rodent cells. The limiting factors in translating this technology into a commercial product have been an inability to establish large-scale reproducible protocols for generation and differentiation of PSCs and access to large collections of genetically diverse well-phenotyped cell lines. In this proposal, we aim to develop a fully automated platform for production of PSC-derived cells in a 96-well format utilizing a genetically diverse bank of cell lines. The large-scale approach will improve the statistical precision in the readouts and provide for parallel production not previously obtainable, which will translate into more predictive models. The product will be available to customers as a service for in-house screening of compounds or we can provide 96-well plates of iPSC-derived NSCs and DA neurons - vials of cells with instructions for plating and initial characterization will also be available. Plates will be generated from either a single cell line for initial screening of large numbers of compounds or independent cell lines from 96 healthy tissue donors representing the genetic diversity of the US population for hit validation. Analysis will include high-content image analysis of cell survival as well as transcriptional profiling. Our goal is to significantly reduce the costs of generating stem cell screening platforms and provide information that is more effective at predicting how human cells will respond to exposure to various toxicants during differentiation and at mature cell states. Our product will support the goals of the funding mechanisms, while also establishing a baseline of variation of transcription for neurallineages that will be critical when determining the significance of toxic effects of chemical compounds or developmental differences when analyzing diseased lines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this application, we aim to develop a fully automated platform for production of PSC-derived neuronal cells in a 96-well format from one (initial screen) and 96 (validation) individuals representing the genetic diversity of the US population.

The Ohio State University is committed to the modeling, optimization, and characterization of RF circuits, meta-materials, and novel antenna arrays. In this program, XCOM and OSU team up to develop phased array antennas based on OSU's tightly-coupled broadband arrays, with beam steering performed by piezoelectric MEMS circuits being commercialized under a U.S. Army CRADA. In Phase I, the team scaled existing phase shifter and array architectures to the 24.5-27 GHz band to meet program requirements, and test structures were fabricated. No incompatibilities of bandwidth, reliability, lifetime, size, or performance were found, and manufacturing constraints have already been folded back into design. In the Phase II effort, the K-band phased array will be prototyped, tested, and iterated, and a commercially attractive version spanning Ku and Ka bands will be developed and prototyped to meet the prime UAV EW and radar developer needs. These are critical technologies to support, as miniaturized phased arrays can lead to the rapid proliferation of low-cost government and commercial radar, EW, and communications systems with higher performance, smaller size, and reduced power consumption. BENEFIT: The electronically steerable antenna subsystems developed in this program will be used in UAV Electronic Warfare sensor systems, pre-shot sniper detection radar systems, communications test sets, and SATCOM systems. The direct benefits to the Department of Defense from supporting this effort include the rapid advancement of a low-cost phased array antenna that will greatly increase the EW and pre-shot sniper detection capabilities of UAVs and other platforms. When used in an EW sensor, for example, this subsystem could alert operators when their UAV is targeted by the handheld commercial radar systems now being used by asymmetric combatants and criminal entities. The system will provide slew-to-cue direction commands compatible with nearly all present camera and weapon systems deployed on UAVs and uUAVs today, at a target cost of only $10k.  Laboratory testing of small-form electronically steered antenna subsystems at Ku, K, and Ka bands will be completed within the timeline of the Phase II effort, with system-equivalent testing to TRL and MRL 5. Environment-equivalent range testing can be completed within 1 year to TRL and MRL 6-7. Phase III field testing and qualified production can begin within two years after Phase II.Additional future benefits will be realized down-stream using these technologies in reconfigurable radar, EW, and communication systems with forward-compatible architectures and software-defined waveforms and signal processing. These technologies accomplish power savings while improving data link quality, security, and EW resilience for our warfighters at reduced cost and component count.The greatest potential commercial benefits are substantial energy savings in cellular infrastructure, reducing carbon footprint. An estimated 10 million tons of CO2 can be eliminated within 5 years of the completion of Phase II if adopted by a single major carrier. Total addressable markets in 2015 for these technologies are projected at $1.4 billion across Government and civilian applications.

XCOR's composite material is lighter than metal, and unlike graphite/epoxy, nonflammable. The material is immune to microcracking, has a low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), and is capable of withstanding hundreds of cryogenic temperature cycles. Additionally, it is durable, repairable, and can withstand extreme hot and cold temperatures. The fluoropolymer composite maintains strength and flexibility at extreme temperatures (-260 to plus 280 degrees C/-436 to plus 536 degrees F).Low CTE also allows this composite to be built into a vehicle's primary structure. Used as the internal skin in a sandwich structure (Nonburnite, foam, and carbon/epoxy) the composite skin-foam-skin material provides both thermal insulation and structure.These features, along with the high strength-to-weight ratio, make it an enabling technology for building lighter, highly reusable, and more robust propellant tanks, thus reducing need for maintenance between flights. Further, XCOR believes significant commercialization opportunities exist for the material after its manufacturing processes have matured."

We will address the issues such as good thrust/weight ratio at small size, low toxicity propellants, and will demonstrate an increase in performance and maneuverability for microthruster technology compared to cold gas or monopropellants. The proposed propulsion system uses self-pressurizing nitrous oxide and ethane with specific impulse approximately 265 seconds for the smaller sizes and 280 seconds for the larger sizes where the injector geometry is more favorable for good mixing. XCOR has developed a 10 N thruster that will be modified with a high expansion vacuum nozzle and partial radiative cooling for this application. The technical objectives of the Phase I program will be to show a complete propulsion system design that masses 5 kg and has a useful propellant mass fraction. A further objective is to look at the trade between thruster types for a larger, more capable, higher thrust system in the 10 kg class and do a preliminary design on the larger system by the end of Phase I."

Nitromethane has a density of 1.14 and the amount of low density oxygen needed for stable combustion is very low. Compared to nitrous oxide and ethane, this combination has higher density, and a greater range of storage temperatures. What is innovative about this approach is the combination of using desensitized nitromethane for better storage and handling properties, along with a new, small and light spark igniter, and just enough gaseous oxygen to permit reliable ignition and stable combustion of the fuel. Nitromethane has long been recognized as a high performance monopropellant, but is too sensitive for real-world tactical handling. If this fuel is desensitized for safety, it no longer works as a monopropellant because the catalysts no longer work. Adding oxygen to desensitized nitromethane and using spark ignition, making it a true bipropellant system, eliminates these problems at the expense of greater system complexity. Since a very small amount of oxygen is needed, the overall system density is reasonably high."

This gives AFRL huge potential leverage for ORS technology development and demonstration in several distinct ways. First, some of the final development work planned for the vehicle is directly relevant to Air Force ORS goals and systems. Second, additional work that could be carried out during development will augment the baseline development effort and further support these goals.

XCOR has experience developing rocket motors with many of these features and it is now time to combine these techniques. We have used a variety of fuel and oxidizer combinations with consistently safe and reliable startup and shutdown during over 13,000 seconds of engine test and flight operations. XCOR will also test a new configuration of injector.The proposed engine design has four specific advantages. First, it uses non-toxic LOX/methane propellants with inherently high specific impulse. Second, it has a new injector design that is inherently low cost to manufacture. Third, it is optimized to operate with self pressurizing propellants, which eliminate the need for either pumps or a propellant tank pressurization system. Fourth, use of LOX/methane means that the main engines, OMS and RCS can all use the same propellants, thus simplifying the overall system and reducing weight."

The objective of this research project is to continue development of a piston pump begun in Phase I. At that time, a breadboard pump was testedand preliminary design was done for a flight-type pump. This development shows promise of extending the advantages of turbopumped rocket stages to a smaller size range and at a lower cost than turbopumps. Phase II will construct and test a prototypeflight-type pump.Small, light weight, responsive pumps such as this could also find application in divert thrusters, satellite maneuvering stages, satellite boost stages, and planetary sample return missions. This technology can be applied to several military and commercial applications in space launch, sounding rocket, and ballistic missile defense. Also, this technology is applicable to the growing interest in commercial space tourism with exo-atmosphericvehicles. XCOR is already receiving private investment money to develop a suborbital, manned, reusable vehicle capable of addressing three potential markets. We have a contract to provide several hundred flights to Space Adventures LLC for adventuretravel rides.

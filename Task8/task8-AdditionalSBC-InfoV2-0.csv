 AMBIHARV INC.,SBIR Phase I: Ultra Low Power Electrostatic Switch Relay for Vibration Energy Harvesting,National Science Foundation,N/A,Phase I,SBIR,1314996,1314996,2013-07-01,2014-03-31,N/A,2012,EI,2013,"$149,992.00",061263985,No,Yes,No,1,,5407 Wild Horse Ct.,,Louisville,KY,40229-1270,Ji-Tzuoh Lin,,(502) 554-5563,(502) 554-5563,Ji-Tzuoh Lin,,(502) 554-5563,ji_tzuoh_lin@hotmail.com,Stub,,,,"This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop an ultra-low-power electrostatic switch relay for the purpose of managing ultra-low-power energy harvesting. Normal power management for energy harvesting, which involves controlling the release and storage of the collected energy, has been accomplished with CMOS-based switches or microcontrollers. Unfortunately, silicon based controllers consume at least a few microwatts of energy. Thus, in a scenario in which the available power is less than that required to run the energy-managing switch or microcontroller, no energy will be harvested. As a solution, the proposed research will provide the development of an electrostatic switch relay, which will utilize low actuate voltage (1.5-5V). In Phase I, the feasibility of this switch will be proven by developing and testing a prototype. The following technical objectives will be pursued: (1) simulate a long-cantilever/short-gap design, (2) develop a prototype device, and (3) test and evaluate the prototype device. The principal investigator hypothesizes an actuation voltage less than 5V for the proposed switch, which will prove that this solution is feasible. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes enabling the recovery of darker, more random, and extremely low disturbance energy provided by solar, vibration, or heat sources in the environment of the device. By commercializing this technology, a device will be offered that can harvest power that is normally too little to be recovered, saved, and reused. A no-power switch with low actuation voltage would be adopted as a key component in the market for ubiquitous energy harvesting. Companies looking for a self-sustained remote control system or for sensors to be installed in the fuselage of airplanes or in buildings would be interested in this product. The proposed solution is better competing devices because of the low power-managing strategy it utilizes for ultra-low energy harvesting. Competing devices either require high voltage or need to consume more power."

advancing next-generation single-cell technologies to impact drug development and bio-manufacturing.
OneCyte is a pioneer of single-cell proteomics and is developing a platform technology that cuts many
months off biologic (e.g. therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) or vaccines) drug development. A
key challenge in biopharma are slow bio-manufacturing timelines. The world is currently experiencing the
impact of slow development timelines on human health and the economy in the extreme example of the
COVID-19 pandemic and its burden of rapidly developing and manufacturing billions of doses of novel
vaccines and MAbs. This is highlighting the need for accelerated drug development and manufacturing.OneCyteâs single-cell platform technology provides insight into cell biology at an unprecedented
scale; potentially enabling new classes of therapeutics, and enhancing basic scientific understandings.
The impact of this technology will be reducing time and cost of pharmaceutical development, as well as
improving efficacy and safety. This can enable developing new drugs for currently untreatable and rare
diseases, which are presently not feasible to develop or manufacture. Beyond this initial application,
OneCyteâs technology could become a readily implemented research tool, enhancing the basic
understanding of biology, or facilitating engineering of cell function for cell therapy applications.OneCyte is seeking funding to expand the innovative single-cell analytical capabilities and screen
for additional critical product quality attributes (PQAs) important for drug safety and efficacy, as well as
transition the single-cell technology platform to a commercial process by the end of SBIR Phase II.In Aim 1. OneCyte will develop and implement innovative single-cell assays for additional PQAs,
focusing on screening for undesired deviations in drug manufacturability, which lead to reduced drug
circulating half-life and reduced production yield.In Aim 2. OneCyte will automate and scale-up single-cell data analytics towards improved
predictivity for drug manufacturability, as well as automate the pipeline for commercial data analytics with
the necessary minimum user input.In Aim 3. OneCyte will develop a manufacturing ready thermoplastic microfluidic chip, replacing
an elastomeric material. Validation of the new plastic chips for use in the single-cell process will be
performed by testing cell performance compared to elastomeric chips.Project Narrative:
The cell line development process is a critical bottleneck in biologics manufacturing as it is time consuming and
labor intensive. OneCyteâs goal is to translate its proprietary high throughput single-cell proteomics platform to
revolutionize cell line development by significantly reducing the time and effort for cell line selection. Accelerating
biologics manufacturing will have direct impact on patient access to novel therapeutics."

Single-cell analysis, or the ability to decipher cell-to-cell heterogeneity, is a limiting factor in biotechnology and clinical applications. This project aims to further develop a transformative platform technology for integrated single-cell analysis capable of addressing existing challenges with the current state-of-the-art. The platform will potentially shift the paradigm of drug development and manufacturing, enabling quick iteration and evaluation of new therapeutic compounds. This approach could significantly reduce the time and cost to bring new drugs to market and reduce the overall cost of treating patients, which is a substantial benefit to society. Beyond this initial application, this single-cell analysis platform could become a readily implemented research tool, enhancing our basic understanding of biology, facilitate engineering of cell function, as well as evaluating safety and efficacy of new drugs and treatments. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a robust and cost effective commercial prototype technology platform for integrated single-cell analysis. A key feature of the platform technology is the unprecedented sensitivity in measuring quantitatively secreted molecules from single cells. This is achieved by incubating single cells in extremely small volumes, and enabling analytics on an unprecedented scale in these microscopic bioreactors. The proposed work will lead to the development of a consumable prototype microfluidic chip, enabling quick and resource efficient adaptation of the platform to the marketplace. The proposed prototype will be validated through relevant studies, addressing a confirmed market need in cell line development. Commercial adaptation of this prototype will potentially provide deep insight into biological and physiological processes on a single-cell level, and transform drug development and manufacturing, therapeutic treatment, as well as clinical diagnostics.

While the technology to acquire vast amounts of data is now well established and continues to expand, the ability to deal with such data, from the process of acquisition, storage, and analysis depends fundamentally on a solid informatics infrastructure as an essential component. Indeed, most of the major gains in productivity in this field are to be realized on the informatics front, in automating data acquisition, defining and sorting data in databases for quality control and analysis, facilitating access to data, and for the large variety of analyses that such data will be subjected. Over the past 2 years we have been involved in establishing an informatics infrastructure in a small genetics laboratory focused on resequencing human immune response genes. From this experience we have built a genetics management system (GEMS) that is applicable in a general way to the management of data acquired from automatic DNA sequencers. This resource includes support for three types of data acquisition: 1) PCR resequencing which can be used for SNP discovery and genotyping; 2) shotgun sequencing projects, applicable to primary data acquisition as well as resequencing of target regions from cohorts in disease studies; and 3) genotyping methods that use capillary-based data acquisition (e.g. micro satellite, SSP-SNP, HLA typing). To this end, we propose to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) To develop a software package that improves the throughput and productivity of small to medium sized sequence-based genotyping and sequencing labs. A prototype of the final package has already gone through two complete code revisions, and is being used to design DNA sequencing trials, organize the sequencing process, gather data, and assess the quality of the sequencing output; and 2) To work in parallel with existing collaborations aimed at enhancing the ability for diverse genetics data producers to share data. We have identified six laboratories that produce genetic sequence data that have agreed to collaborate with us in testing the existing software. From this experience, we will learn and incorporate new functionality into the software with the aim of producing a package that can effectively support the activities of all six laboratories."

These tools were used to model and analyze the assembly of a ship&#039;s double bottom blocks, and to model weld shrinkageand distortion, the principal sources of dimensional variation in shipbuilding. The potential applicability of DCS dimensional variation modeling, simulation, and analysis processes and tools is already very high within the shipbuilding industry. However,during Phase II the improvement of dimensional variation modeling capabilities associated with weld shrinkage and distortion modeling, the refinement of dimensional management processes to suit the industry, and the involvement of U.S. shipyards in thedevelopment and evaluation of these processes and tools, will greatly improve the potential applicability of dimensional management practices within the shipbuilding industry."

The PM2FC concept is closely related to microchannel, membraneless fuel cells (MMC&#039;s) that have been previously described in the literature.  Just as for MMC&#039;s, the PM2FC concept is based on laminar flow of fuel and oxidantsolutions separated by a virtual membrane that allows for proton conductivity, while minimizing mixing of the two solutions. The novel PM2FC design proposed offers an exciting opportunity for fabricating industrially-scalable models of 1-10W (andostensibly higher) membraneless fuel cells. Issues that will be addressed in the Phase I of this project include: (1) cell geometry optimization; (2) materials issues, such as electrode type and microstructure; and (3) new fuel/oxidizer combinations,emphasizing those that have proven unsuitable for conventional PEM-based fuel cells.The need for a compact, reliable, light fuel cell, capable of increased power and fewer logistics problems cannot be overstated. Both military, Army in particular, andindustry are working intensely on developing such devices. The PM2FC design, if successful, will open remarkable opportunities both for federal and civil markets. In this case, -9 2-6.LLC will enter in R&D agreements with ARO and ARL, to assure that thenew fuel cell will be designed and built according to the military specifications in the shortest possible time.In the commercial sector, the company plans to pursue various applications, mainly in small power sources for consumer electronics - the market that might grow extremely rapidly in the coming years.

Civilian applications include drones for package delivery, inter- and intra- campus transport, eVTOL urban air mobility (UAM) for materials and people.Â Â In the defense sector, the US military has long used UAVs for ISR and for tactical operations.Â Â UAV and drone technology are now available to our advisories, having been used to target oil plants and military bases and operations.Â For commercial and non-hostile applications, tracking air vehicles, atmospheric conditions, and weather is critical to the widespread adoptions of manned and unmanned air vehicles (M/UAVs). However, neither transponders and beacons integrated in M/UAVs, nor implementation of a radar-based air traffic control (ATR) are practical due to spectrum regulation, development times, weight and cost. For non-cooperative and hostile applications, the lack of terrestrial based detection and tracking is a critical security gap; there is a requirement for âdrone sensorsâ that can detect, classify, and locate a hostile drone to protect military operations.Â Â Currently there is no available passive M/UAV or drone sensor for either civilian or military applications. To address these critical gaps, 0BD and WRC are developing technology that exploits ubiquitous digital waveform broadcast (FM, TV), cellular network (4G, 5G), and other wireless signals as illumination sources of opportunity. The illumination sources are reflected passively off M/UAVs or phase shifted by weather and atmosphere.Â Â By collecting and analyzing these reflected and phase shifted signals, we have shown in Phase 1 and previous work, the ability to detect, classify, and locate M/UAVs and measure changes in atmospheric and meteorological conditions. We propose in this Phase 2 STTR to develop, prototype, and fabricate RF receivers and integrated signal processing to capture the opportunistic signals reflected by M/UAVs and use Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) that employ Transfer Learning (TL) to autonomous detect, classify, and track M/UAVs, outputting data that can be shared with other command and control systems."

This capability is derived from existing bodies of research as well as applied development activities undertaken by the team to measure atmospheric conditions using opportunistic sources like 4G and 5G LTE, broadcast television and emergency responder signals. This capability requires no RF band licensing, exploits the coherent nature of the underlying waveforms, is implemented using common Software Defined Radio (SDR) semiconductors, and can be used for both terrestrial based systems or airborne systems. Novelty is derived by exploiting the underlying coherent waveforms as well as the precision timing of these signals. The near ubiquity of RF systems from 10MHz to 60GHz provides a plentiful range of signals to harvest for our multi-static detection capability. The fact that many of these systems are critical infrastructure requires them to maintain operations in nearly allÂ conditions - often having regulatory requirements for 99.999% operational availability. The number and types of signals offer exceptional source redundancyÂ allowing a system to ""switch"" between sources depending on operational conditions and resolution required. This provides inherent system robustness. This class of passive Radar system can be used to augment air traffic control and traffic management in heretofore never experienced patterns and densitiesÂ associated with urban air mobility and unmanned air vehicle concepts. As Agility Prime advances these systems control and monitoring systems like this will become critical for regulatory approval. Management of air traffic in urban and suburban areas will require a multitude of monitoring systems irrespective of the capabilities required by regulatory bodies for aircraft organic sensor systems to track their position and report it via data links. Clearly the potential for aircraft to have failures, be intentionally tampered with, or to spoof other aircraft in a highly congested airspace, particularly around hubs, suggests that terrestrial and other airborne tracking systems will be required. The ability to license RF channels to operate new active systems is very difficult in most regions. The potential for passive Radar where RF signals - from HF through K band - are plentiful is a logical application. The approach we pursue is a novel adaptation of applied research conducted by the team to measure temperature and humidity using opportunistic signals. In that effort we used commercially available SDR chip sets. In this effort we will use similar SDR chip sets to ultimately arrive at a very low cost adaptive receiver. The architecture hasÂ the capability to be an exceptionally low ""Size Weight and Power and Cost"" (SWaP-C) device that has a broad range of military, commercial and consumer applications.Â"

The pain associated with superficial and partial-thickness dermal wounds can be intense and sustained
throughout the healing process. Inadequate pain management can impair wound healing, prolong
hospitalization, decrease patient satisfaction and increase healthcare costs. Due to limited treatment options and
the short duration of current local anesthetic formulations, opioid analgesics are the mainstay of pain
management for these patients despite their association with a variety of adverse events. Consequently, pain
from dermal injury is not optimally treated because providers lack a safe and effective alternative to opioids for
their patients.
109 Therapeutics is developing BUPIVADERM, a novel, drug-delivering wound dressing that provides sustained
bupivacaine delivery to partial-thickness dermal wounds in a predictive and extended manner. The novel wound
dressing will be a first-of-kind wound dressing that provides both the wound healing properties of the traditional
moist wound dressings clinically available, but with the added functionality of safe and effective analgesia for 5
days. The dressing will only need to be applied one time and non-traumatically peels off once re-epithelialization
occurs, thus eliminating the need for dressing changes or analgesic redosing. The novel wound dressing will
provide significant value to patients, clinicians, and society alike by increasing patient satisfaction, mitigating the
use of opioids, and reducing cost of care in the treatment of partial-thickness dermal wounds.
In preliminary experiments, we have demonstrated the ability to fabricate bupivacaine-loaded microporous
polymer films that have the same dimensions and physicochemical properties of the current gold standard moist
wound dressings, but with the added ability to provide 5 days of sustained bupivacaine delivery. The proposed
work will seek to demonstrate in vivo technical feasibility of the novel wound dressing by validating the safety,
wound healing and analgesic efficacy of our prototype in a standardized porcine dermal injury model. Analgesic
efficacy and duration will be assessed by von Frey assay of mechanical sensitivity, wound healing will be
assessed via gross and histological assays, and systemic toxicity will be assessed via pharmacokinetic
assessment. The proposed Phase I work will demonstrate that our novel sustained bupivacaine release wound
dressing can provide 5 days of safe and effective non-opioid analgesia and non-inferior wound healing in a
clinically relevant pre-clinical model, which would warrant continuation of commercialization efforts.PROJECT NARRATIVE
In this proposal, 109 Therapeutics will develop a novel, opioid-sparing anesthetic wound dressing for partial-
thickness dermal wounds (e.g., second-degree burns, skin graft donor sites, abrasion injuries). By combining
moist wound healing and extended-duration analgesia, this technology has the potential to change how pain
from dermal injury is managed. Significant value may be realized by patients, providers and society by improving
patient satisfaction, reducing opioid-related adverse events, and lowering overall costs of care."

Every year in the United States about 30% of the 60,000 infants born extremely premature (andlt;30 weeks
gestational age and andlt;1000 g birth-weight [ELGA]) develop intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). IVH is associated
with high risk for cerebral palsy and significant intellectual disability, causing lifelong implications for affected
children and their families and considerable economic burden. IVH is caused by the rupture of the fragile
capillaries in the germinal matrix which cannot withstand fluctuations in cerebral blood flow (CBF). In andgt;90% of
cases, these injuries occur during the first three postnatal days during a period of cardiorespiratory instability
that has a direct effect on CBF, which results in periods of cerebral hypo- and hyper-perfusion. Current
management strategies, such as changes in ventilation or inotrope support, are blind to the impact on CBF.
Improved bedside technologies to continuously monitor CBF are urgently needed to allow the clinician to make
informed decisions, to optimize current strategies and foster the development of new interventions to reduce the
incidence of IVH in ELGA infants and to improve developmental outcomes. Building on 149 Medical founding
teamâs ten years of success measuring infants with non-invasive bedside optical methods, we propose to design
and build a novel fast multi-distance diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) system, optimized for continuous
monitoring of CBFi in ELGA infants. DCS directly quantifies an index of cerebral blood flow (CBFi) by measuring
the temporal fluctuations of light generated by the dynamic scattering of moving red blood cells. To be of use in
the ELGA infant, this bedside monitor needs to be safe, continuous, precise, reliable, quantitative and gently
wearable. These pre-requisites will be met by designing an optical sensor which can be gently applied to the
ELGA infant. The novel DCS system will be initially tested by the 149 Medicalâs team in phantoms to verify
performance and demonstrate precision and accuracy of flow estimates. The system will then be tested in more
mature, stable premature infants at the Brigham and Womenandapos;s Hospital (BWH) NICU to evaluate feasibility of
long measurements, compatibility with the NICU environment, skin integrity after long monitoring periods, and
in-vivo algorithm validation. Finally, the device will be used in 50 ELGA infants during the first 72 hours of life to
test our hypothesis that DCS-measured CBFi fluctuations and pressure-passive events correlate with incidence
and severity of IVH. Our goal is to provide a much-needed cerebral blood flow monitor to guide individualized
treatment with the goal of reducing the risk of IVH and improving long term neurodevelopmental outcomes among
ELGA infants. This study in 50 ELGA infants will set the stage for a larger trial alongside commercialization.PROJECT NARRATIVE
There is a great need for a bedside, non-invasive and continuous neuromonitoring tool to provide a robust
measure of cerebral blood flow in premature infants. We propose to develop a novel near-infrared diffuse
correlation spectroscopy (DCS) system optimized for monitoring of the cerebral blood flow index in extremely
premature infants. The successful development, validation and demonstration of clinical feasibility and
effectiveness of our proposed technology will lead to new patient management approaches for reducing
neurological injury, protecting neurocognitive function, and reducing the overall morbidity and mortality

Never in the history of the United States has the unmet medical need to develop novel, non-opioid
therapeutics for chronic pain been more urgent than it is today. More than 65 million US adults suffer from
chronic pain, resulting in almost $635 billion in annual healthcare costs. Despite their limited efficacy, and
potential for addiction, tolerance, and impaired motor performance, opioids have become a mainstay for
chronic pain management, resulting in an opioid epidemic that is ravaging communities throughout the US.
Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel, non-opioid therapies for chronic pain management. This
application addresses this unmet medical need by leveraging our novel artificial intelligence (AI)-driven
drug discovery platform to develop selective inhibitors of calpain-1 as novel non-opioid therapeutics for
chronic pain. Studies in chronic neuropathic pain animal models have shown that nerve injury overactivates
calpain-1, which downregulates K+ Cl- cotransporter activity, resulting in diminished synaptic inhibition
and neuropathic pain. Prior work by our group has also shown that both pharmacological inhibition and
whole body genetic knockout of calpain-1 attenuates chronic pain behaviors in mouse models of sickle cell
disease (SCD). Importantly, the analgesic effect of calpain-1 inhibition did not induce tolerance side effects,
suggesting the potential for calpain-1 inhibitors to be non-addictive. By applying our innovative artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven drug discovery platform to screen a virtual chemical library, we identified four (4)
novel calpain-1 inhibitors, and validated them for efficacy in biochemical assays. Here, we propose to
progress our most potent hit compound to a lead compound that is calpain-1 selective, cysteine protease
family selective, non-opioid, and CNS penetrant with efficacy demonstrated in at least 1 of 3 chronic pain
animal models tested, including chronic sickle cell disease pain, chronic inflammatory pain, and chronic
neuropathic pain. Three aims are proposed, including Aim 1: Synthesize ~100 analogs of our most potent
hit compound, and characterize in vitro activity and selectivity. Success criteria: Top 20 cell-permeable,
calpain-1 inhibitors, moderately selective against calpain-2, and highly selective against cathepsins and
caspase-1, Aim 2: Evaluate ADME-Tox and PK profile of our top 20 calpain-1 inhibitors from Aim 1.
Success criteria: Top 2 CNS-penetrant selective calpain-1 inhibitors with favorable in vivo PK profile, and
Aim 3: Determine the efficacy and PK/PD relationship of our top calpain-1 inhibitor in 3 chronic pain
animal models. Success: at least 40% reduction in mechanical hyperalgesia in at least 1 of the 3 chronic
pain animal models tested. Successful completion of this Phase I will yield a novel CNS-penetrant, selective
calpain-1inhibitor with efficacy demonstrated in at least 1 chronic pain animal model. Our overall product
would be the first, oral, CNS acting, selective calpain-1 inhibitor for chronic pain. Importantly, our product
would reduce opioid usage in chronic pain patients, and help to stem the US opioid epidemic.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Never in the history of the United States has the unmet medical need to develop novel, non-opioid
therapeutics for chronic pain been more urgent than it is today. Calpains are enzymes that have been
shown to cause pain in many animal models of chronic pain. We propose to leverage our proprietary
artificial intelligence (AI)-driven drug discovery platform to develop a selective calpain-1 inhibitor as a
novel, non-opioid therapeutic for chronic pain."

An innovative method of evacuating the pre-concentrator chamber provides an additional gain in pre-concentration of 2 to 3 orders of magnitude. In short, the device will provide a pre-concentration gain of 10e3 to 10e6 with an analysis time of less than 30 seconds and requires less than 10W of power (average). In addition to proving the high concentration gain for a list of chemicals of interest, the project will also ensure that the measurement of chemicals of interest to the CBD program (e.g., CWAs and TICs) is also enhanced. The device will be designed such that the effects of temperature, humidity, and background contaminants are minimized.

(20/20) is a small business concern focused on the development of diagnostics for personalized medicine. Towards this end, 20/20 has developed, with the support of the NCI's SBIR program, an improved approach to immunohistochemistry ( Layered-IHC also referred to as Layered Expression Scanning (LES)) that permits 10 or more biomarkers to be measured simultaneously from a single section of biopsied tissue while maintaining morphology. No other marketed technology has this dual capability. This SBIR Phase II Bridge Award proposal aims to develop, clinically validate and commercialize a series of companion diagnostic tests for cancer therapeutic agents, the efficacy of which may be influenced by the activity levels of proteins in the mTOR pathway (including PI3-K, Akt, and mTOR). The mTOR pathway is an important pathway in tumorigenesis and currently the target of several drugs on the market for kidney cancer (TORISEL(R) and AFINITOR(R)) as well as over a dozen compounds in Phase I-III trials for multiple tumor types. It has been demonstrated that a more complete characterization of the mTOR pathway is required to best determine the appropriateness of a specific therapy and as such measurement of a panel of multiple biomarkers will be required. Thus 20/20's L-IHC system is a most appropriate system for the development of mTOR companion diagnostics. This SBIR Phase II Bridge Award proposal seeks to develop what is likely the first mTOR companion diagnostic, PredicTOR , and clinical validation of this test in two or three cancer types, specifically kidney cancer, breast cancer and lung cancer. This work will be done in consultation with the FDA and will include the necessary protocols and procedures to obtain regulatory acquiescence or approval of the products as laboratory developed tests (LDTs). To increase the likelihood of successful and timely commercialization, applicant plans to match the requested 2.75 million in government funding (over 3 years) with at least 3.75 million in private sector investment. This private investment will come from one or more strategic partners ( 2 million) and individual investors ( 1.75 million). 20/20 has a proven track record in procuring both equity investors and corporate partnerships and has already successfully commercialized innovative products developed with federal funding. Commercialization of these products is expected by the conclusion of the funding period.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This SBIR Phase II Bridge Award proposal seeks to develop what is likely the first mTOR companion diagnostic, PredicTOR , and clinical validation of this test in two or three cancer types.

Unfortunately, more than two-third of patients with HNSCC are diagnosed only after the disease is advanced. Failure to diagnose this cancer early is mainly attributed to the unavailability of a screening test for high risk patients as well as frequent misdiagnosis of early stage cancer by primary physicians. An autoantibody immunoassay for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is expected to become a novel non-invasive tool for early diagnosis. Our long term strategy, which would become the subject of a Phase II SBIR grant application should Phase I work be successful, is to develop a tobacco user&#039;s chip to screen for both HNSCC and lung cancer in one blood sample, because current and former smokers are at high risk for both diseases. The serological test should have a significant impact on the quality of medical care for persons at risk, particularly for over 20% of the US population who are users of tobacco and/or alcohol products. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A blood test for early detection of head and neck cancer could provide a cost-effective screening approach when applied to presently known high risk groups, who are: users of tobacco and/or alcohol, the immune-compromised, and those with premalignant lesions. It would enable a viable strategy for reducing the severe mortality rate of this disease."

When used in concert with radiographic imaging, a sensitive and specific blood test for NSCLC could be a clinically valuable and cost-effective tool for early diagnosis. The immune system responds to tumor-associated proteins by secreting autoantibodies long before metastasis occurs. Autoantibody profiling for this important group of circulating tumor markers in peripheral blood has lead us to the identification of appropriate target peptides. Using a T7 phage display library derived from the cDNA of a NSCLC line, we have developed a panel of eight peptides which were formatted as a protein microarray for use in a simple capture immunoassay (Zhong et al. 2006, J. Thoracic Oncol. 1(6), 513). When probed with a blood sample, the array can identify the presence of tumor-associated antibodies in NSCLC but not in normals with both sensitivity and a specificity exceeding 90% at early and later stages of the disease. As used to measure tumor-associated antibodies in serum from a cohort of cancer patients and risk- matched controls, this test affords predictive accuracy that exceeds that of currently available circulating NSCLC- associated protein markers. The overall purpose of this application is to achieve three aims: 1) subclone the DNA sequences encoding the eight peptides identified in our initial discovery effort into two fusion-expression vectors, 2) prepare microarrays of the fusion peptides described in aim 1 and demonstrate that they enable measurement of autoantibody profiles that can distinguish cancer from normal blood samples with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. 3) Finally, we will acquire a cohort of 30 NSCLC and 30 at risk controls and validate the above peptides as bona fide lung cancer biomarkers using protein microarrays. Microarrays of the purified peptides will be used for rigorous optimization and standardization of all technical and clinical performance measures for the multi-target immunoassay. Our initial clinical application will be early detection of lung cancer, although multiple applications in lung cancer management are rational. Our data shows feasibility and proof of concept that supports the rationale for further development and testing of this approach. A subsequent Phase II application will lead to use of an appropriate platform for definitive marker validation trials for application to clinical screening of NSCLC. Thus the primary goal of this application is to develop a novel blood test for NSCLC that can be rapidly translated into clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A blood test for early detection of lung cancer could provide a cost-effective screening approach, and in concert with CT scanning would enable a viable strategy for reducing the severe mortality rate of this disease."

In Phase I, the basic numerical schemes for the optimum design will be establish along with a pilot code to verify these techniques. Also developed will be a general turbulence package for any typical FE CFD software. In Phase II, a complete software will be developed and checked out for the simulation of complex practical problems."

21MedTech, LLC is developing SERENZATM, a non-opioid analgesic that is released from a bioresorbable film
for post-surgical pain management. Post-surgical pain management is a significant contributor to the risk for
opioid addiction and diversion. There were nearly 129 million outpatient surgeries in the U.S. in 2018 and
orthopedic surgeons alone account for nearly 8% of all opioid prescriptions in the U.S. Though the risk for
addiction and diversion is high, there are currently few alternative options to opioids for the management of post-
surgical pain and new approaches are needed to reduce patient exposure to these drugs and improve the
ongoing opioid crisis. There have been several products and therapies attempting to provide non-opioid
postoperative pain relief, but these products only work for 24 to 48 hours, despite claims otherwise, and others
still require additional rescue medication. To meet this urgent need, we are developing SERENZA. SERENZA is
a polymer film loaded with local anesthetic that is implanted at the surgical site following operation. Tunable
formulation of the film and loading enable control over local release for pain relief for up to four days following
surgery. The polymer film is bioresorbable and safely degrades over time. We have demonstrated safety of our
polymer film carrier, efficacy of the drug, and proof-of-concept of our system in vivo. Our Phase II objectives are
to optimize drug release kinetics and develop manufacturing standards, determine effective dosage for retention
of motor function, and determine safety and efficacy in mouse neuropathic pain models. Completion of these
goals will progress SERENZA toward first in-human clinical trials and successful FDA approval. Successful
approval and commercialization of SERENZA will enable a powerful new strategy for providers to reduce or
potentially eliminate the use of opioids and the risk of opioid use disorder for patients following surgery.PROJECT NARRATIVE
There is an urgent need to develop non-opioid postoperative pain management solutions. In this project, we
are developing a bioresorbable drug delivery product that can release controlled amounts of non-opioid
analgesic over time to manage pain for several days following surgery. Continued development and successful
FDA approval of this product will reduce or eliminate the need for opioids postoperatively. This will significantly
reduce patient exposure to these drugs and stem the ongoing opioid crisis while providing safe and effective
pain relief."

The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop a safe, effective and user-friendly vitrification system for
cryopreservation of whole human ovaries. In the U.S., over 140,000 girls and women age 0-49 are diagnosed
with cancer annually. While improved diagnosis and treatment have led to increased survival rates (75% in
premenopausal and 85% in childhood cancer patients), devastating side effects of cancer therapies include
premature ovarian failure, infertility and menopause-related health risks. While cryopreservation of embryos
and oocytes are effective, ovarian cortex and whole ovary cryopreservation is the only option for future fertility
in prepubertal patients and those who require immediate cancer treatment. Cryopreservation of whole ovaries,
compared to ovarian tissue, has added advantages of 1) preserving all classes of follicles, which can be used
for in vitro maturation, 2) longer graft lifespan, and 3) faster recovery supported by existing blood vessels after
transplantation with vascular anastomosis. However, current methods for whole ovary cryopreservation are
suboptimal and there is no technology designed for cryopreserving human ovaries, despite it being the best
choice for prepubertal cancer patients for future fertility and intact endocrine function for decades without the
help of exogenous hormones. The proposed research is part of 21st Century Medicineâs more general program
of developing superior organ cryopreservation systems, including cryoprotective agent (CPA) solutions,
perfusion apparatus (hardware and software) for CPA loading and unloading, and liquid nitrogen storage units.
This Phase II will help us initiate our effort in achieving our ultimate goal as an organ banking company. Our
company has successfully demonstrated functional preservation of vitrified rabbit kidneys after transplantation.
In this SBIR Phase II study, we will validate and continue improving our success thus far in whole ovary
vitrification using large animal models of ovary transplantation in pigs and sheep (sheep has an established
ovary transplant procedure and their ovarian structure is closer to the human than the pig). We will also
develop a nonhuman primate preclinical model for ovary transplantation as well as characterize the cryogenic
properties of monkey ovaries. Furthermore, we will finalize the Ovary Perfusion Device and develop a closed
system for storing individual cryopreserved ovaries for eventual clinical use. The resultant technology of this
Phase II project will be the first perfusion unit designed for the human ovary and can simultaneously control
temperature, pressure, flow rate and CPA concentration with a build-in feedback mechanism to maintain
constant pressure during perfusion. Upon successful completion of Phase II, we will submit a Phase IIb
application to include fertility trials using the nonhuman primate model, human tissue xenografting
experiments, and finalizing strategies for commercialization. This novel system will offer new hope to the
thousands of cancer survivors and the impact could be significant and sustained.PROJECT NARRATIVE
One devastating side effect of cancer treatment is premature ovarian failure which can lead to
infertility and long term health risks associated with menopause. Compared to existing fertility
preservation methods (embryo, oocyte and ovarian tissue cryopreservation), whole ovary
cryopreservation offers complete recovery of ovarian function (endocrine and fertility), which is
important for young, especially prepubertal, cancer patients. Currently, technology for
cryopreservation of whole human ovaries does not exist; therefore, the overall objective for this
SBIR project is to develop a safe, effective and user-friendly cryopreservation system for human
ovaries."

Having improved means for cell and tissue cryopreservation can increase the effectiveness of bioresource centers containing banks of high quality cells and tissues for research. It can also provide cryopreserved cells for direct patient therapy (e.g. oocytes and ovarian tissue for fertility preservation, stem cells and pancreatic islets for transplantation). The objectives of this Phase I application are to develop a microfluidics cryopreservation system based upon an existing system designed for cell culture and imaging. The current system will be significantly modified in a manner that will allow it to deliver precise concentrations of solutions containing cryoprotectants at temperatures ranging from + 37 to -20 degrees C for cryopreservation of suspended cells. This will facilitate rapid cryoprotectant diffusion into cells before cryopreservation, and dilution out of cells after cryopreservation. It will also allow cells to be exposed to cryoprotectants at reduced temperatures, mitigating chemical toxicity. The aims of this project are to determine means to rapidly mix combinations of solutions and to determine the appropriate flow rates for solutions of varying viscosity. We also plan to design a new microfluidics chip specifically for cryopreservation applications as well as a cooling unit to accompany the existing hardware; a capability that the current device lacks. Mixing will be assessed by analysis of digital images taken of the solution in the final flow path, where metallic microspheres have been suspended into one of the initial solutions. Appropriate flow rates will be determined by assessing the properties of microspheres suspended in the solutions during flow. With such an instrument, high throughput cryopreservation for suspended cells and small tissue can be accomplished, significantly reducing the financial and technical burden associated with cryopreserving laboratory animal germplasm, and also offers a more accurate and reproducible means to archive cells and tissues for research and therapeutic uses.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is designed to develop a device that will facilitate making improvements in methods to preserve cells and small pieces of tissue using very low temperatures (cryopreservation). Cryopreserved cells and tissues are important for many reasons, such as direct medical therapy (e.g. transplantation of blood cells), and also for providing consistent biological samples for scientific study by numerous researchers (e.g. when studying cancer or other chronic diseases). Such a device will also significantly increase the efficiency of cryopreserving germplasm from laboratory animals, reducing the overall costs to public agencies for storage and distribution of these valuable research tools."

In phase 1, a range of cryoprotectant formulations, in combination with various carrier solutions, will be tested on rabbit hippocampal slices. Also included in the experimental design will be time and emperature variables for the purpose of optimizing tissue loading and unloading protocols, and warming and cooling rates for the purpose of optimizing vitrification characteristics. A range of electrophysiological and chemical measurements will be performed on the tissues after treatment to assess tissue functionality. The expected result of the phase 1 experiments is the demonstration that vitrification technology previously tested on other tissues can be successfully applied to neural tissue. In phase 2, information resulting from the optimization of variables from phase 1 will be used to generate final product configurations for the chemical formulations and associated apparatus necessary to facilitate the physical inventory of preserved neural tissue slices for commercial use. Direct confirmation of the practical utility of such cryopreserved tissue, in cooperation with industrial users, for ADME studies and other medical applications, will also be a part of phase 2. An improved, practical, preservation (by vitrification) methodology for neural systems (neurons, neuronal cell lines and neural tissues) opens the door to a variety of important improvements relating to public health and costs. The possibility of long-term storage of fragile and irreplaceable neural tissues and cell lines will allow for improved logistics, and true neural tissue banking. This will also have the effect of reducing costs by reducing the need for research animals and methods currently employed to obtain such tissues. Improved preservation of transplantable neural cells and tissues also makes possible benefits in the treatment of public hearth issues such as Parkenson&#039;s, Alzheimers, stroke, and spinal cord injuries. It is also possible this technology may be useful in the creation of systems to monitor for the presence of environmental neural toxins in military or antiterrorist applications."

This proposal will build upon existing results indicating that a new renal preservation solution developed at 21st Century Medicine (Renasol) is superior to the industry standard, UW solution, in both canine and leporine renal transplant models. The proposal will explore a combination of Renasol and a specific new formulation of protein factors (""trophic factors"") that dramatically improve hypothermic storage of dog kidneys. More information will be obtained on the appropriate concentration of trophic factors using the rabbit renal transplant model. A potentially valuable additive for Renasol that may help protect human kidneys from the effects of agonal hypotension will also be evaluated. Canine renal transplants will also be performed using kidneys preserved by simple cold storage for 4 days with Renasol and with Renasol + trophic factors. In anticipation of clinical application, and resulting stability requirements, tests will be conducted, using both the canine and leporine models, to show Renasol retains its effectiveness after months of prior storage at 4 deg. C. These studies will result in a final formulation that will be taken into human clinical trials in Phase II and marketed in Phase Ill. During the course of the proposed studies, urine samples will be collected on a routine basis and subjected to protein profiling using an in-house proteomics workstation. These observations will determine whether the degree of hypothermic injury observed is correlated with definable relative or absolute changes in urinary protein concentrations. This may provide a new predictive diagnostic marker of renal preservation injury. The ability to preserve kidneys with less damage prior to transplantation will significantly reduce the costs and risks of post-transplant dialysis, reduce rejection episodes, and increase the net organ supply."

The model involves preservation of canine hearts and evaluation by transplantation and functional assessment over a 6-hour observation period following weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Preliminary
results indicate excellent recovery of 5 out of 5 hearts after preservation for 40 hours. We propose the development of a very simple yet highly effective preservation device that should enable clinicians to employ the new preservation method without difficulty, safety concerns, or substantial expense. Phase I primarily seeks to show that unattended use of the device
yields preservation quality that equals what has been obtained previously with manual methods. Phase II would further employ the device to fully optimize this highly promising method in preparation for human clinical trials, which can be done at the Research Institution when warranted. It is now accepted that excellent matching between donors and recipients can result in at least a 50 percent increase in survival rate 10 years after transplantation. The ability
to extend human clinical cardiac preservation to 40 hours would allow transcontinental prospective matching, with expected substantial gains in clinical outcome for potentially thousands of heart transplants recipients."

However, when an unexpected failure occurs, it can introduce significant delays in not only the specific aircraft""s maintenance, but of the entire network of systems. 21st Century Systems, Inc. (21CSi) is in the position to answer this challenge with a concept called Reactive Aircraft Maintenance System via Evolutionary Scheduling (RAMSES). This project""s namesake was known for his organizing ability and capacity to move large projects along. Just as Ramses utilized the best technology of his day, RAMSES uses powerful algorithms to optimize the maintenance network in the face of unforeseen failures. The base optimization engine is an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), which provides the ability to operate under the uncertainty an unforeseen failure creates through the use of Subjective Logic. This enables the algorithm to optimally select a maintenance plan that deals directly with the materials, personnel, and facility, yet allow the algorithm to handle the uncertainty of the availability of each. The result is a shop floor capable of effectively handling any unforeseen event. And, with 21CSi""s sustained superlative commercialization index, we are the right company at the right time to improve ALC operations. BENEFIT: The RAMSES concept will have direct benefit to both the military aircraft depot as well as commercial aircraft depots. RAMSES provides a method to optimally reschedule the entire depot if an unforeseen event occurs that may cause major disruptions in the work flow. Behind the scenes, RAMSES is able to interlink all the components and activities at the depot using an evidential reasoning technology, the Evidential Reasoning Network (ERN). ERN technology allows us to describe the effects an unforeseen event would have on the components of the depot in terms of added or reduced delay. By incorporating uncertainty directly into the calculations, we are able to form conditional bounds on the effect. The EA then solves the optimization problem using these bounds. Therefore, when an unexpected event occurs, RAMSES sends out the rescheduling plan directly to the same system that the technicians are currently using. RAMSES will even develop contingency plans in the case of compound or cascading events. As far as the technician is concerned, the result is simply a change in the schedule. However, the depot supervisor, overseeing the entire operation, will notice how RAMSES maneuvers the depot floor to account for the unexpected event whilst maintaining the highest throughput possible given the anomaly. We also see this technology expanding beyond aircraft. Almost all fleet type operations have some form of maintenance shop. Land, sea, and air all require their vehicles to be periodically serviced to maintain the performance necessary for operational success. RAMSES is able to optimize scheduling from the smallest to the largest operations. The innovative ERN method to describe the relationships of the components and vehicles in the shop can be scaled for any size operation. The result is an integrated tool that saves time in a situation that usually only costs time and resources."

But, the proliferation of sensor systems has created a large volume of multi-sensor data across a number of physical spectra. These resulting measurements can be so disparate that traditional aggregation methods perform poorly given heuristics/assumptions required to map them into conventional algorithms. The team of 21st Century Systems, Inc. (21CSi) and the Missouri University of Science and Technology (MS & T) propose to develop an innovative multiphysics-based sensor fusion approach, called Voxel Fusion (VOXION). Applicable for improving target detection and discrimination in the ISR domain, VOXION maps the disparate sensor fields from a suite of EO/IR, RF and acoustic sensors into a single common multiphysics-based representation. Estimates on target parameters are then obtained directly from the unified physics field improving system accuracy, decreasing uncertainty, and achieving improved inferences more resilient to changes in the targets and environmental conditions as compared to classical fusion approaches. The innovative voxel-based concept; our diverse, well-qualified team; combined with 21CSi""s superlative, sustained record in SBIR/STTR commercialization; makes our team the right choice to improve multiphysics-based sensor fusion for the warfighter. BENEFIT: The VOXION multiphysics-based sensor fusion algorithm will be able to map the disparate sensor fields into a single common multiphysics representation that is needed to improve target detection and discrimination in the ISR domain.  VOXION would generate estimates of target parameters from a unified physics representation of objects, improving system accuracy, decreasing uncertainty, and achieving improved inferences more robust to changes in the targets and environmental conditions. Thus, VOXION will markedly improve the fusion of data from disparate sensor types in order to improve situational awareness and sensor hand-offs. The VOXION technology has the potential of maturing into a cohesive multi-sensor fusion tool to assist in the traditionally manual processes of unlike sensor aggregation. This will not only improve the accuracy of the resulting situational awareness picture, but also allow for faster situation recognition and more rapid actionable intelligence. Bottom line...faster, better decisions."

Addressing this challenge, 21st Century Systems, Inc. (21CSi) and the University of Oklahoma will be investigating a concept, dubbed Sensor Handoff via Advanced REasoning (SHARE) Under Uncertainty, which utilizes nested fusion loops that account for the feature data, applying uncertainty bounds to compare against previous information.

Through examining the sensor characteristics and systematically addressing the uncertainties and biases, our research may be able to uncover common features usable to track targets as they cross sensor modalities. This handing over back and forth capability would allow a network of sensors each with unique characteristics to maintain the surveillance and greatly improve missile defense."

Smart Multimodal Image Registration and Fusion (SMIRF) will produce a higher contrast composite image through selective fusion of multiple sensor modalities regionally within each image. SMIRF combines state-of-the-art image enhancement, real-time cross-modality registration, advanced saliency detection, proven image fusion methods, and a decision-making engine to create a dynamic real-time multimodal, locally optimal region-based video fusion solution. SMIRF""s adaptive approach allows it to intelligently choose""the right tools for each job,""rather than forcing the same solution in every situation. With our extensive experience in video analysis products and with a 100th percentile SBIR commercialization rating, we are just the company to deliver this capability so submariners can focus on seeing what""s in the area and not on which setting to use."

The challenge is in finding useful bits in terabytes of data that directly relate to the nature of time-varying, multivariate data. An intelligent data mining capability is needed that has both knowledge (descriptive physics) and foresight (cognitive model of usersâ needs). Concurrent Agent-enabled Feature Extraction (CAFÃ), from 21st Century Systems, Inc. and Brigham Young University, will address this challenge. CAFÃ features 21CSIâs intelligent agent technologies that leverage BYUâs expertise. CAFÃâs innovative intelligent agent structure and evidential inference engine will allow concurrent data-mining, making it possible for multiple analysis methods to work together to improve the data-mining performance. This phase implements a bottom-up clustering algorithm to help tune feature extraction and predict features well before the simulation has converged. The agent design allows direct collaboration between data-mining algorithms and scientist. CAFÃ allows the scientist to observe and correct data-mining of simulations without wasting valuable research time. With our impressive track record of transitioning technology (100th percentile DoD commercialization index) and our strong team, we are the right team to provide intelligently guided concurrent data-mining for high fidelity fluid dynamic simulations. BENEFIT: Current costs to develop a new aircraft engine are more than $2 billion and 10 years. While the Air Force and other services donât develop these components internally, the development of a new aircraft engine or airframe can have significant military application. University researchers and commercial contractors perform the lionâs share of this type of work. A better understanding of the complexities of the component and its interactions could have a significant impact in extending the envelope of current aircraft and in the development of new aircraft. CAFÃ offers the capability to perform intelligent concurrent data-mining for high fidelity fluid dynamic simulations. The CAFÃ tool is able to extract and display accurate, near real-time patterns from massively large data sets by searching for physics-related events in complex large scale simulations. With CAFÃ, the potential exists to go even further through the interaction of concurrent, on-the-fly, queries and responses among the CAFÃ agents as well as with the human operator. The primary target customer will be the CFD researcher at the research institution or commercial entity. Initially, the CAFÃ tool will be tailored to simulations of fans and compressors of gas turbine engines. In order to minimize overall technical risk while at the same time reducing physical testing costs, aircraft manufactures continuously search for computational design tools to remain competitive. They rely heavily on continual advancement of the technological frontier for faster solutions to more complex problems, more accurate results with improved performance, enhanced safety, environmental acceptability, and less time involved to develop new products. 21CSI recognizes these challenges facing aircraft manufactures. The computational models developed under CAFÃ will significantly accelerate the testing cycle allowing more efficiency in the design processes used to develop various types of flight vehicles. Using these tools, aircraft engineers and designers can address a wide range of design challenges including airfoil and geometry selection, wake vortex alleviation, flutter aero-elastics, load design, stability and control, and high-speed wing design. Businesses will be easily able to justify the CAFÃ software expense with the time saving that achieve."

Significant video degrading is caused by clouds, haze, and dust in the atmosphere; jitter and blurring from the UAV platform motion; and low video resolution due to sensor characteristics and high altitude flying. Higher quality video would alleviate much of the challenge for the operator, increasing the likelihood that they will detect and identify targets and increase their confidence in the presence and type of targets. Improving the quality of video would also increase the autonomous detection and tracking capabilities that support the operatorâs ability to interpret the images and make timely decisions. 21st Century Systems, Incorporated is excited to continue to apply our extensive video analytics expertise in developing Video20/20, an innovative real-time EO/IR video-enhancement toolset.  Video20/20 is a set of software tools that provide real-time quality video with higher resolution and contrast enhancement making it easier to detect and distinguish enemy activities in video collected from UAV platforms. And, with an SBIR commercialization rating second-to-none, we are just the company to deliver this capability to the warfighter. BENEFIT: There is an immediate need for this video enhancement capability in all branches of the DoD. Unmanned Systems technology has been revolutionized during the current OIF and OEF conflicts, and we can expect to see even more of them in future conflicts. UAVs have performed thousands of ISR missions (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) in support of ongoing operations. They have greatly expanded the level of real-time intelligence available to the warfighter. Despite the many recent advances in Unmanned Systems technology, there are many technical challenges yet to overcome. The limitation of the value of any ISR platform is the ability of a human operator to interpret actionable intelligence from the video stream. Soldiers, Airmen, and Image Analysts are currently hampered by video that is often low-quality and difficult to interpret. By developing a tool that can improve image quality, we can greatly improve the tactical value of every Micro and Small UAV in service. Our system will enable a next-generation capability for UAV operation. It will allow an operator to interpret data from a single UAV much more easily, with less fatigue and eyestrain, and provide greater situational awareness than existing systems. It will also allow the same operator to more easily monitor multiple UAV video streams and be able to interpret and act on them with minimal effort. By cleaning up the imagery, the operator will be able to maintain a much greater understanding of the ground situation with less effort on their part. Video enhancement tools are a key piece to achieving object detection and tracking. For example, in Iraq, a national curfew is in place in the evening prohibiting civilians from being out. Many of the IEDâs are emplaced in the dark after the curfew. Having auto detection and tracking of humans would enable the warfighter to use multiple UAVâs in patrolling an area and alert on any people that are detected after curfew. One operator could monitor multiple UAV video streams and be able to interpret and act on them with minimal effort. This would minimize the manpower requirements and maximize the detection of curfew violators enabling strict enforcement of the curfew and, as a result, saving lives."

Following a very successful Phase I effort, the team of 21st Century Systems Incorporated (21CSI) and Missouri University of Science and Technology is pleased to propose to continue our research and development of a counter surveillance concept called TRANSURV. This transmission surveillance tool is the synergistic pairing of RF DF equipment and video cameras to provide persistent perimeter surveillance without incurring a large manpower footprint. The RF sensors are used to cue video cameras (slew-to-cue), which slew to the RF source. Utilizing advanced video analytics, TRANSURV analyzes the scene for human presence and alerts the operator. Built on 21CSIÃ¢â¬â¢s successful force protection product line, TRANSURV provides decision support that enhances situational awareness and security. Combining 21CSIÃ¢â¬â¢s extensive experience in force protection decision support, service oriented architectures, and video analytic technologies, with MS&TÃ¢â¬â¢s expertise in RF detection, this team is the most qualified to field this capability."

Often, it is impossible to manually search through the data that can come out of these simulations, which may range from Gigabytes to Terabytes. Furthermore, it may be impossible to visualize the multi-dimensional interactions that are occurring in the data. A tool is needed that will concurrently data-mine the vast data sets that are produced and alert the scientist of significant events (either planned or unplanned). 21st Century Systems, Incorporated and Brigham Young University introduce our Concurrent Agent-enabled Feature Extraction (CAFÃ) concept to answer this challenge. CAFÃ features state-of-the-art data-mining and analysis leveraging BYUâs expertise. An innovative intelligent agent structure from 21CSI will allow concurrent data-mining utilizing information sharing that will make it possible for multiple analysis methods to work together to improve the data-mining performance. The agent design, specifically the evidential inference engine, also allows direct collaboration with the data-mining algorithms by the scientist. In this way, CAFÃ allows the scientist to observe and correct the data-mining of high-fidelity fluid dynamic simulations maximizing valuable research time.  BENEFIT:  Searching for physics-related events in complex large scale simulations will be enhanced by a tool that extracts and displays accurate, near real-time patterns from massively large data sets. With CAFÃ, the potential exists to go even further through the interaction of concurrent, on-the-fly, queries and responses among the CAFÃ agents as well as with the human operator within a single social network. During Phase I, with the approval of the AFOSR TPOC, 21CSI will contact the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Information Directorate at Rome Labs to acquire end user requirements for CAFÃ. The 21CSI team fully intends to build and transition key technological elements such as the collaborative agent concept and information inferencing products using the collaborative environment derived from 21CSIâs Evidential Reasoning NetworkTM (ERN) technology â to suitable USAF and DoD development centers for concurrent data mining. Furthermore, military command & control (C2) operations involved with blast and fragmentation effects in urban areas will benefit from this technology. Urban combat damage to structures could inhibit troop movements or induce sniper stands. The Battle Command Battle Lab - Ft. Huachuca is interested in the technology for a new training simulator for artillery planners and commanders. CAFÃ will expand the capabilities already developed for Ft. Huachuca by allowing us better insight into blast events and produce a more accurate simulation. The team of 21CSI and BYU will pursue further development of CAFÃ with proposals to General Electric Aircraft Engines. Currently, it costs more than $2 billion and 10 years to develop a new aircraft engine. BYUâs vision is to create a world-class virtual simulation of an entire jet engine to allow repetition in the process to be done virtually at a lower cost and shorter time. With the addition of CAFÃ the experimentalist can perform concurrent efforts saving simulation time and data storage costs. Together, this would help to uncover problems before a significant investment is made in building a physical jet engine model. While physical testing can never be eliminated, it can be reduced from current set of 12 versions of development engines â a costly and time-consuming process. Another U.S. government, but non-DoD, area of active interest is modeling to stop terrorist activity here at home. At the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), the Nonproliferation, Homeland and International Security (NHI) directorate aims to be the premier provider of systems solutions to preclude WMD proliferation from terrorist attack. LLNL will partner with research institutions and industry to transition new capabilities to operational use. Mitigating the consequences of potential effluent plumes from a released WMD that a terrorist might want to use at a large public gathering coupled with [un]favorable weather might be desirable to the evil-doers.

The commercial transition is similar to the military transition. The target customer list is somewhat narrow, but very important in terms of overall capabilities and revenue generation. Commercial satellite services revenue grew at an impressive rate from $86.9 billion in 2005 to $111.1 billion in 2006, while commercial space infrastructure revenue was up from $28.7 billion in 2005 to $33.1 billion in 2006. Commercial satellite services represent the dominant space sector accounting for 50 percent of space economic activities. Direct-to-home television services were up 20 percent to $55 billion in 2006. The commercial space industry is enormous and is totally dependent on a relatively small number of on orbit vehicles essentially low density, high demand assets. The $55 billion direct-to-home television service in the U. S. currently has 18 on-orbit satellites. In this high risk business a single satellite on orbit represents an investment in excess of $300 million. Â In commercial space, just as in military space, you cant protect what you cant see. The U. S. commercial space industry, as well as the U. S. military, currently has a very difficult time seeing into space and understanding what is happening to critical on orbit assets. Sensors and systems are in development to provide information about what is happening in space. Space-ACE will provide more rapid and effective fusion and overall understanding of the picture in space improved space situational awareness.

Â Significant video degrading is caused by clouds, haze, and dust in the atmosphere; jitter and blurring from the UAV platform motion; and low video resolution due to sensor characteristics and high altitude flying. Higher quality video would alleviate much of the challenge for the operator, increasing the likelihood that they will detect and identify targets and increase their confidence in the presence and type of targets. Â In addition, improving the quality of video would increase the autonomous detection and tracking capabilities that support the operators ability to interpret the images and make timely decisions. 21st Century Systems, Incorporated is excited to apply our extensive video analytics expertise to develop Video20/20, an innovative real-time EO/IR video-enhancement toolset. Â Â Video20/20 is a set of software tools that provide in real-time haze-free, stabilized video with higher resolution and contrast enhancement making it easier to detect and distinguish enemy activities in EO/IR video collected from UAV platforms. Â The software tools will be designed for improving the image quality of UAV EO/IR video for both human interpretation and to improve autonomous detection and tracking capabilities. Â Â  BENEFIT: There is an immediate need for this video enhancement capability in all branches of the DoD. Unmanned Systems technology has been revolutionized during the current OIF and OEF conflicts, and we can expect to see even more of them in future conflicts. UAVs have performed thousands of ISR missions (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) in support of ongoing operations. They have greatly expanded the level of real-time intelligence available to the warfighter. Â Despite the many recent advances in Unmanned Systems technology, there are many technical challenges yet to overcome. The limitation of the value of any ISR platform is the ability of a human operator to interpret actionable intelligence from the video stream. Soldiers, Airmen, and Image Analysts are currently hampered by video that is often low-quality and difficult to interpret. By developing a tool that can improve image quality, we can greatly improve the tactical value of every Micro and Small UAV in service. Â Our system will enable a next-generation capability for UAV operation. It will allow an operator to interpret data from a single UAV much more easily, with less fatigue and eyestrain, and provide greater situational awareness than existing systems. It will also allow the same operator to more easily monitor multiple UAV video streams and be able to interpret and act on them with minimal effort. By cleaning up the imagery, the operator will be able to maintain a much greater understanding of the ground situation with less effort on their part."

The team of 21st Century Systems Incorporated and RTI International is pleased to propose to research and develop our POWER (Political Will Expert Reasoning) tool. The tool is intended to help operational and tactical military leaders to reach informed decisions critical to the success in the USG stabilization efforts by providing information about the country&#039;s political leaders and assessing their willingness to collaborate with the USG on counter-insurgency, counter-terrorism, and stabilization. The POWER concept utilizes a computational model of Political Will accounting for its complex, non-binary structure and changes over time. We will also investigate application of three types of cutting-edge intelligent information processing technologies: probabilistic evidential reasoning with uncertain, imprecise, and incomplete information; multi-lingual text processing and text mining technologies, and natural language-motivated knowledge representation and reasoning technologies."

This will serve the needs of a myriad of applications, such as system integration, testing, certification, training, rehearsal, and life-cycle support. The current methodology of generating pre-planned âcannedâ scenarios does not provide the testing personnel or training teams with the robustness and flexibility needed to optimize their objectives. Newly emerging technologies, such as intelligent agent-based software components, enable the creation of high fidelity models that can be controlled âon the fly.â  Real-time control of any of the tactical entity-impacting variables, from sea state or threat submarine depth, will result in an immediate change in the stimulation level to reflect the changing simulated tactical or environmental situation. 21st Century Systems, Incorporated (21CSI) is pleased to propose to continue its research and development of the Submarine Automated Simulation (SubAutoSim). SubAutoSim is an intelligent agent-based software architecture that will enable the assignment of constraints and/or objectives for automated creation and control of simulated entities during a training or test scenario in order to improve realism for systems development and training activities. BENEFITS: The Modeling and Simulation community is making great progress in developing ever more complex virtual environments for training, testing, gaming, designing, rehearsing and planning, to name a few. Many of these commercial M&S systems work with scenarios that have an input from an unpredictable human source. In these cases, the requirement for agent-based simulation controls that can optimize the simulation for the unfolding situation would certainly be of great value. SubAutoSimâs agent-based technology being development for the Submarine OBTT Master Controller will clearly have its initial applications in the back fit submarines employing the BQQ-10 Sonar system, of which OBTT is resident. The technology will be equally useful in the various submarine attack centers and simulators. As the fleet operators become more familiar with the submarine-based applications and its training benefits, it is expected that the other warfare communities will introduce the technologies into their afloat training products and systems. While the specific agents discussed in this Phase II are submarine training centric and exclusively conceived for Naval training scenarios, the technology that unburdens the training system operators and enhances training effectiveness are universal and clearly has opportunities to transition with other military organizations. The leveraging of the 21CSI AEDGEÂ® open agent architecture will allow rapid prototyping of warfare specific training applications and agents at a fraction of the development cost that others may require. In general, the SubAutoSim concept adds intelligence and more mission fidelity to a simulation/stimulation training system. It fills the gap between qualification training and mission training/rehearsal. This allows the training to be enhanced from a mere âdriving the boatâ simulator to an intelligent synthetic mission environment. The concept can be applied to any number of military, government, and civilian domains. Beyond submarines, the application of SubAutoSim-like concepts can be applied to a flight simulator to create a synthetic mission environment for the aviator. Beyond mere âstick-and-rudderâ training, the aviator can train and rehearse in a variety of missions. In the commercial realm, transportation, power, and manufacturing operations are likely domains to apply the SubAutoSim-like concepts to create more mission-oriented training."

Emerging capabilities are partial recovery, forecast of impending problems, and increased operational use during abnormal operations. What is needed is an automated health monitoring capability for electric machinery and systems that have high fault detection, and low false alarm. Additionally, the capability performs âself-healingâ functions to reduce down time of electrical machinery. The team of 21st Century Systems Incorporated and the University of Missouri is pleased to propose the development of a tool that will provide the automated health monitoring and self-healing capability and decision support necessary to improve the survivability of our Naval vessels. We call our Phase I concept Proactive Predictive Machine Maintenance (P2M2). We will be leveraging existing work in health monitoring and embedded systems techniques combined with cutting edge research into advanced sensor design and intelligent computing to design a Fault Diagnostics, Prognostics, and Self-Healing Control system.BENEFITS: The list of potential military applications for these capabilities is quite long. The 21CSI team fully intends to build and transition key technological elements; embedded systems, machine learning, CBM technology, etc.; to suitable Navy and DoD large electrical machine systems. 21CSI will build the distributed software, with agents, tailored to the specific applications. Once the prototype agent-based system is reasonably developed (likely, midway through Phase II), we will commence transition. The Navy will be the potential government customer, the P2M2 system will be placed in-line between the sensor and the shipâs monitoring system (ICAS or similar) to monitor, diagnose, predict, and ultimately control Navy electrical machinery. $1.2 M - $1.5M and ~18 months will be required to complete the P2M2 Model development. The majority of the funding is required for investigating P2M2 user requirements, for building a P2M2 model, and to build a prototype. A modest portion of the necessary funding (~$100K) will come from 21CSI IR&D. The vast majority will come from Phase II, Phase II Options, and Phase III SBIRs. 21CSI has strong DoD application marketing capabilities due to its market penetration for more than ten years with good contacts and a strong reputation with most SETAs. In addition, 21CSI has informally spoken with potential customers regarding P2M2 for electrical machinery and learned that the planned capabilities and pricing are very attractive to those potential customers. Once the system is accredited, 21CSI will launch a campaign to educate DoD, other government agencies, and commercial customers on the capabilities and applications of the P2M2 Prediction Software for electrical machinery. If this technology is proven to be feasible after Phase I and meets requirements at the end of Phase II, it will be transitioned to ONRâs Advanced Integrated Power System (AIPS) program under the Enterprise and Platform Enablers Future Naval Capability (FNC). The technology will be demonstrated 1) in simulation on ONRâs Virtual Test Bed (VTB) and 2) in a full scale medium voltage demonstrator together with global power system management capabilities currently being developed. The commercial customer will be primarily airlines and cruise ship companies. The P2M2 system will help the airlines reduce operating costs and provide timely and required maintenance upon landing. There are currently numerous vendors of each of the key technology components required for developing the Fault Diagnostics, Prognostics, and Self-Healing Control Proactive Predictive Machine Maintenance (P2M2); however, no one is offering a platform independent, COTS-based integrated solution. 21CSI has several dimensions of sustainable competitive advantage for the P2M2 system once development is completed and the system is accredited."

Our proposed research will use the 4D/RCS cognitive architecture and will extend it with a model which allows its interaction and integration with an intelligent agent-based AI environment. We believe that intelligent agents are a natural fit for the problem at hand. The hierarchical RCS architecture defined in 4D/RCS can be described very closely by a multi-agent system. This effort will lead to the development of an overarching architecture that will bridge the gap between intelligent agents and RCS. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: This effort will lead to the development of an overarching architecture that will bridge the gap between intelligent agents and RCS. There are many domains where this toolset can be used to improve manufacturing, production, and operations. In the case of manufacturing, we would target the manufacturers of industrial robots. This toolset would make it possible to make smarter and more flexible robots. The time and expense of acquiring large industrial robots for manufacturing and retooling is non-trivial. This toolset would make the robotic systems more flexible. Retooling and ""tailoring"" of the system&#039;s capabilities and actions would be quicker and much easier. The technologies germane to this toolset could also be applied to make autonomous systems smarter and more fault tolerant. Systems that operate in remote environments (space, underseas, etc.) require a large measure of autonomy in order to accomplish the mission successfully. The toolset technologies could be used to produce better remote systems (satellites, undersea vehicles, etc. _ and unattended sensors (antennas, security sensors, waning systems, etc.).

But, as Operation Iraqi Freedom recently showed, foreign militaries have equipment to locally jam GPS signals. Another effective method ofautonomous navigation is necessary to ensure mission success. Similar to rudimentary terrain recognition used in early cruise missiles, the matching of terrain video images with onboard digitized terrain information can be used to accurately provide aplatform with effective positional awareness. The team of 21st Century Systems, Inc. and the University of Nebraska at Omaha is pleased to address the first step in achieving this worthy goal. Our proposed research focuses on developing a mathematicallysound approach for image similarity detection and extraction. The project is aimed at the development of a methodology that is suitable for various military weapon system applications such as target identification and autonomous navigation of unmannedvehicles. The method is based on the Eigen-similarity of a set of image features. We call this concept the Eigen-Similarity Integral (ESI). The advantages of an ESI-based method for comparing and matching the dominant components of images includecomputation effectiveness, uniqueness, flexibility, and conciseness. The ability to perform a computationally effective comparison of real-time images with images or video from a library is a key enabling technology for many military and commercialactivities. Militarily speaking, this capability could be used for automated target recognition, automated target tracking, and autonomous navigation for unmanned weapon systems. Certainly, a navigation or targeting system based solely on GPS is neitherrobust nor fault-tolerant. An ESI-based navigation system would provide that advantage. An ESI-based software application would accelerate the exploitation of intelligence and UAV camera imagery and ground moving target indicator (GMTI) video. Using theESI-based image discerning capability of GMTI video, contextual map data, and intelligent agents, this application of our research could assist with target recognition, target tracking, and detection through clutter (i.e., trees). Many non-militaryapplications involving video monitoring would benefit strongly from the core concept: facility and physical security, traffic monitoring, and others.

To date, oxaliplatin has become an integralpart of various chemotherapy protocols, especially in advanced colorectal cancer. For colorectal cancer, oxaliplatin has been used with folinic acid (leucovorin) and 5-flurouracil (5-FU); this combination, referred to as FOLFOX, is now a treatment standardfor colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, like many other anticancer drugs, oxaliplatin has several significant side effects, most notably, thrombocytopenia. The use FOLFOX is well established and widely used for colorectal cancer. However, thrombocytopenia has been noted in more than 70% of patients receiving FOLFOX. As of today, there is no FDA approved drug indicated specifically for treating oxaliplatin-induced thrombocytopenia. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop a new agent specifically for oxaliplatin-induced thrombocytopenia. The ultimate goal of this project is t develop a novel small-molecule TNF- modulator, UTL-5g, to be used in conjunction with oxaliplatin for the treatment of colon cancer to significantly reduce oxaliplatin-induced thrombocytopenia. In this SBIR phase I study, several preclinical studies will be conducted to achieve the following specific aims: Aim 1. To show that, in a dose dependent manner, UTL-5g increases number of platelets lowered by oxaliplatin in vivo (a) To determine the nadir of platelet count after oxaliplatin treatment at the MTD (i.e., how many days after oxaliplatin treatment will platelet level be the lowest?). (b) To define the relationship of dose/schedule of UTL-5g and blood platelet counts. (c) To blend the schedule and doses obtained from (a) and (b) to show the effectiveness of UTL-5g in ameliorating the platelet suppression induced by oxaliplatin. For all these studies, when applicable, we will conduct counts/analyses on platelets, WBC, bone marrowand CD41+ megakaryocytes. We will also monitor the injuries on liver and kidney by analyzing AST, ALT, BUN, and creatine. In addition, cytokines, including TNF- and IL-10 (both are significantly reduced by oxaliplatin) will be assayed. Aim 2. Based on aim1, to select a dose range and conduct a therapeutic assessment to show that UTL-5g does not affect the anticancer activity of oxaliplatin (using a human colorectal cell line, HCT-15). Once this SBIR Phase I study is successfully completed, we will have shown the feasibility that UTL-5g can be used in conjunction with oxaliplatin to relieve oxaliplatin-induced thrombocytopenia and UTL-5g is a promising adjuvant agent worthy of continued preclinical development.

Therefore, a chemoprotective agent which reduces the side effects of cisplatin without affecting its efficacy would have significant clinical benefit. Currently, amifostine is the only FDA approved chemoprotective drug for cisplatin therapy. Amifostine is a sulfur-containing agent that reduces side effects resulted from both chemotherapy (including cisplatin) and radiotherapy regimens. Unfortunately, there are significant limitations associated with amifostine including its potentially serious side effects and potential tumor-protective effect. An ideal chemoprotector should not interfere with cisplatin's therapeutic effect, and with little or no toxicity by itself. As such, in our recently completed SBIR Phase I study, we investigated a small-molecule modulator of tumor necrosisfactor alpha (TNF-a), UTL-5g, as a leading chemoprotective agent. Based on this SBIR Phase I study, UTL-5g has been shown to reduce levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) elevated by cisplatin, indicating the protection of kidney and liver by UTL-5g. Blood levels of TNF-a elevated by cisplatin were also lowered by UTL-5g in a dose- dependent manner. An exciting finding is that not only UTL-5g did not reduce the antitumor effect of cisplatin in vivo, pre-treatment of UTL-5g actually increased the therapeutic effect of cisplatin. In addition, UTL-5g has a very low acute toxicity. All these exciting results from the SBIR Phase I study indicate that continued preclinical development is warranted. The specific aims of this SBIR Phase II study are: [Aim 1] Compare the chemoprotective effects by both oral gavage and ip injection (which was used in Phase I) in animal studies and determine the optimal oral dose of UTL-5g. If the ADME study shows that UTL-5g may be a pro-drug, we will also use the same protocol to study the chemoprotective effect of the metabolite(s). [Aim 2] Use the optimal oral dose of UTL-5g (determined in Aim 1) and increasing doses of cisplatin dose to find whether the MTD of cisplatin in mice can be increased by UTL-5g. If the MTD of cisplatin does increase, conduct a therapeutic assessment of cisplatin at the new MTD with and without UTL-5g. [Aim 3] Use the optimal oral dosage from Aim 1 to conduct the ADME study. [Aim 4] Scaleup the synthesis of API and prepare up to 1 kg of UTL-5g. [Aim 5] Conduct the 28-day repeat- dose toxicity studies in two species under GLP condition, employing the oral dosage form of UTL-5g. [Aim 6] Develop an oral formulation of UTL-5g suitable for thefirst clinical trial; develop and validate an analytical method for the oral formulation; define the specification and conduct a stability study on the oral dosage form. [Aim 7] Prepare a draft protocol suitable for the first Phase I clinical trial. [Aim8] Compile a pre-IND package in the format according to FDA's guidance for Industry and be ready for a pre-IND meeting with the FDA.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This SBIR Phase II study is the continuation of the successful SBIR Phase I study to conduct the preclinical development of a small-molecule TNF-a modulator, UTL-5g, as a chemoprotective agent to prevent/reduce side effects induced by cisplatin without compromising its therapeutic effect."

Currently, amifostine is the only FDA approved chemoprotective drug for cisplatin therapy. Amifostine is a sulfur-containing agent that reduces side effects resulted from both chemotherapy (including cisplatin) and radiotherapy regimens.

Therefore, amifostine is not an ideal chemoprotector. An ideal chemoprotector should be orally administratable, with a longer half-life as compared to amifostine, and with little or no toxicity by itself. As such, we are proposing to investigate several novel small-molecule modulators of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF?), specifically UTL-5b, -5d, and -5g, as improved chemoprotective agents. UTL-5g will be the leading candidate for this Phase I study due to its promising biological effects and extremely low acute toxicity while UTL-5b and -5d will be backup compounds. UTL-5g is the subject compound in our recently completed SBIR Phase I grant for liver radioprotection (# 1 R43 CA117033-01A1). As a result, we have obtained promising results which are supportive of this proposal. The specific aims of this Phase I study are: (1) to conduct an animal study to show the chemoprotective effect of UTL-5g for cisplatin-induced side effects; the dose of UTL-5g with maximal protection will also be determined, (2) to conduct an animal study to show that UTL-5g does not decrease cancer killing during cisplatin therapy, and (3) to conduct a pharmacokinetic study to determine the half life of UTL-5g, and any metabolite(s). Once this phase I study is completed, we will know (1) whether UTL-5g reduces nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and/or myelosuppression induced by cisplatin in mice, (2) the optimal dose of UTL-5g for chemoprotection against cisplatin treatment in mice, (3) whether UTL-5g compromises cisplatin&#039;s anti-tumor activity in mice, and (4) the half-life of UTL-5g in mice and any metabolite(s).

In the pastyears overgenetic variants have been linked to complex human traits through
genome wide association studies GWAS  However the predictive power of many of these variants
remains limited and it is still unclear how best to use the wealth of information generated by GWAS to
impact personal health and clinical practice For nearlyyearsandMe has been not only a driving
force in direct to consumer genetic testing but also has established an innovative crowd sourced genetics
research platform This platform has yielded a compelling data resource and many genetic discoveries In
this proposal we will address the next phase of  andMe human genetics research the development of
highly scalable and accurate disease risk estimation
Two of the key challenges in human genetics research are to determine how to use results of GWAS to
paint an accurate picture of an individualandapos s disease risk and to determine how these estimates can
provide information of personal and clinical utility These challenges are difficult due to many factors
including the wide spectrum of disease classes the paucity of genetic and phenotypic data and significant
methodological and computational challenges In this proposal we present a plan to utilize the genetic and
phenotypic data stores at  andMe to develop validated risk estimation algorithms  In Phase I we will
build a computational pipeline that will be used to develop predictive algorithms for estimating disease risk
 Aim and use this pipeline to evaluate predictive ability of different estimation approaches in a broad
class of human complex traits Aim In Phase II we will validate these algorithms in external cohorts
and build customer facing reports that we will test for user comprehension
We believe that the development of accurate risk estimation capability will have a major impact on both

The background documentation for this meeting noted that  In order to effectively utilize new sequencing technologies for clinical applications, appropriate evaluation tools (e.g., standards, well established criteria) are needed to determine the accuracy of the results.  Achieving excellent data quality from next-generation sequencing technologies and understanding when the results may be in error is of clear importance, whether the results are being viewed by a clinician or a consumer. For this application, 23andMe will focus onthe analysis of the accuracy of next-generation sequencing technologies using approximately 150 exomes (including 50 new exomes sequenced for this project) and 100 whole genomes, specifically with reference to false positive and false negative rates for variants located in known disease genes. 23andMe has genotyped over 125,000 individuals and reported data back to them on hundreds of disease-associated variants. This experience has shown us that many important disease genes are difficult to assay with a genotyping chip, whether due to pseudogenes (e.g., GBA), paralogs (e.g., SMN1, CYP2D6) or for unknown reasons (e.g., APOE). We have also noted differences in genotyping accuracy between blood and saliva. For this reason, we expend significant resources validating the results of our genotyping chip using positive controls derived from the 23andMe customer database. The 50 exomes we will sequence for this project will be chosen to carry Sanger sequencing-validated disease-associated variants in the disease genes listed above. This project is a crucial first step in our goal of creating a pipeline for next-generation sequence annotation that combines (a) stringent QC based on genotyping array and Sanger sequencing data; (b) manually curated data from the humangenetics literature; and (c) computationally derived variant assessment for variants of unknown significance; to produce a report that will be returned to a consumer for a personalized health assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Before we can achieve broad adoption of novel sequencing technologies in the clinic, we must understand when their results are accurate.

Discovery of genetic variants affecting allergic disease risk would contribute to our understanding of disease mechanisms as well as guide work towards improved diagnostics and treatments. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have become well established as powerful tools for elucidating the genetic basis of disease. Recent experience with GWAS of complex traits shows that effect sizes at individual loci tend to be small, hence, the field has moved towards large, collaborative studies that combine data from multiplecohorts. In this context, the 23andMe participant cohort, with more than 100,000 genotyped individuals who have consented to participate in research, is a unique resource for studying the genetics of common disease. We have collected survey data in the 23andMe cohort covering a variety of asthma and allergy related phenotypes. More than 25,000 participants report one or more allergies, more than 8000 report an asthma diagnosis, and more than 5000 report having eczema. Our objective is to use the 23andMecohort to investigate the genetic and environmental basis of asthma and allergic disease. In Phase I, we will fully characterize and validate our self- reported phenotypes in the 23andMe cohort, and relate them to clinical definitions used in other studies. We will perform association studies informed by that phenotypic analysis, and participate in large consortia to meta-analyze GWAS for asthma and eczema.

Although the field of pharmacogenomics has had some success in discovering relationships between genetic variants and drug response, a great deal of genetic variation in drug response remains unexplained. Our broad, long term research aim is to identify novel pharmacogenetic associations using web-based phenotyping of efficacy and toxicity for several major drug classes. With that goal in mind, our short term aim is to determine whether web-based collection of phenotype data along with genome-wide data for thousands of 23andMe customers leads to replication of known associations between responses to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and the gene CYP2C19, and between responses to several commonly used medications and the gene CYP2C9. The specific aims of this study are (1) to develop and administer web-based surveys to collect information regarding response to several commonly used classes of medications (including antihistamines, analgesics, blood thinners, and proton-pump inhibitors) from at least 3,000 individuals; and (2) to determine whether this web-based research model yields replications of known associations between several commonly used medications and the genes CYP2C19 and CYP2C9. To conduct this innovative study the 23andMe research group will leverage several resources, including a broad set of drug metabolism-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the 23andMe custom genotyping array. This project will also leverage involvement of a rapidly expanding, engaged, genotyped cohort of 23andMe customers who have the option to participate in research by responding to web-based questionnaires. The parallel and continuous nature of this research model allows for the efficient recruitment of participants to many studies at once and reduces the cost of re-contacting for additional analyses. As evidence of our rapid capability to assemble a cohort, an initial survey regarding commonly used medications solicited, within a month, responses from about 2500 individuals genotyped at 580,000 SNPs. Possible outcomes of this study include the replication of known pharmacogenomic associations and the discovery of novel associations. If the study is successful in yielding replications, it will set the stage for rapid, well-powered and cost-effective research on variation in response to a large number of medications, thereby significantly advancing personalized medicine.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The availability of personalized genetic information regarding the efficacy or toxicity of medications could lead to improved patient care, and save consumers, insurers and medical institutions billions of dollars per year.

These are formed from combustion processes such as motor vehicles and ships, forest fires and biomass burning, as well as indoor cooking in developing countries. BC and BrC are important components of atmospheric aerosols (small airborne solid and liquid particles) that affect air quality, visibility and climate. The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 7 million premature deaths globally in 2012 were linked to air pollution, and black carbon-containing aerosols are often singled out as a major contributor due to their strong linkages to adverse health effects. Accurate and robust monitoring of BC (and BrC) at a lower cost is necessary in urban and industrial areas throughout the United States and abroad to provide adequate temporal and spatial measurements that can be used to assess regional air quality models and estimate community exposure risks. This information will then make it possible for local and regional government agencies to develop mitigation strategies that protect the health of their communities. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the problem of accurate and inexpensive Black Carbon (BC) measurements by developing a long-path photometer to quantify airborne BC and BrC particulates. The most common commercially-available technique for BC and BrC requires collection of particulates on a filter. This filter introduces numerous artefacts requiring complicated corrections. Other existing techniques are quite expensive and require significant expertise to operate. The Black Carbon Photometer (BCP) to be developed here will not require pre-concentration on a filter, thus providing a direct, correction-free measurement. It will be operationally simple and require little maintenance, similar to photometers routinely used in monitoring networks for gas phase species such as ozone. The initial BCP will be low power, portable and is projected to cost less than currently available BC analyzers. Thus, it should provide researchers in air quality and public health, as well as those in monitoring agencies, a practical and economical alternative to existing technologies."

Project Summary Abstract
 Workers in the oil and natural gas industry are vulnerable to exposure to toxic mercury Hg vapor as a
result of routine inspection and maintenance of equipment such as compressors and other process equipment
that concentrate species of low volatility over time Exposure of workers to mercury is of concern in many other
industries as well including the chlor alkali industry where mercury is used as an electrode gold and silver mining
where these precious metals are extracted with mercury manufacture of fluorescent and other lamps dentistry
etc The mercury monitors currently on the market are large and difficult to transport and operate in many of the
settings where mercury exposure occurs As a result there is a great need for a personal mercury monitor to
protect the health of industrial workers Mercury vapor concentrations are best measured by absorbance of the
 nm emission line of a low pressure Hg lamp the same method used for measurements of ambient ozone
Compared to ozone however mercury detection istimes more sensitive In preliminary work we
modified our recently developed Personal Ozone Monitor  POM  for mercury concentration measurements
This pocket sized instrument weighs only lb and consumes only  watts of power In a proof of concept
application earlier this year the modified POM displayed excellent precision for Hg of g m in field testing by
a leading oil and gas company on their oil and gas production platforms in the North Sea during annual inspection
and maintenance A problem discovered with this prototype instrument however is that the necessarily small
internal mercury scrubbercm volume has very limited capacity due to the limited number of adsorption sites
on the sorbent surface In order to solve the problem of limited scrubber capacity for Hg we propose to develop
a photochemical mercury scrubber that photo oxidizes Hg in the gas phase to nanoparticles of HgO that pass
through the instrument We have demonstrated and quantified this Hg scrubbing principle in laboratory
experiments Advantages of the photochemical mercury scrubber includetheoretically unlimited scrubbing
capacity endowment of the personal mercury monitor with high selectivity against other UV absorbing species
such as ozone NO  and volatile aromatic compounds that may occur in industrial environments and
elimination of any interference due to sudden changes in humidity With these advantages and our company s
previous innovations in miniaturizing instruments for detecting airborne trace gases a breakthrough in
technology for monitoring mercury exposure in the workplace is achievable The deliverable for this project if
funded will be a pocket sized personal mercury monitor with precision and accuracy comparable to much larger
fixed location monitors Deployment of the Hermes Personal Mercury Monitor will improve the safety of
workers in all industries where exposure to mercury vapor is a potential hazard Project Narrative
Workers in the oil and natural gas industry are particularly vulnerable to exposure to mercury vapor because of
their proximity to its sources and maintenance requirements of equipment that often concentrates species of low
volatility We will develop a new pocket sized personal mercury monitor that will allow workers to monitor their
exposure to this neurotoxin in real time"

We propose to develop, test and evaluate a low cost, portable analyzer for the measurement of nitric oxide (NO) in human breath as an indicator of airway inflammation, especially for the diagnosis and treatment of asthma. A method for NO measurement in exhaled breath recently was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and its equivalent in the European Union for the purpose of diagnosing, monitoring and treating patients with asthma and other airway diseases. The instrumental approach (NIOX(r) of Aerocrine AB) makes use of the highly sensitive technique of NO + O3 chemiluminescence, but that method is too complicated and expensive for use in the home. In preliminary results, we have demonstrated the use of a much simpler technique that uses the NO + O3 reaction in a different way. Instead of measuring chemiluminescence, the loss of O3 is measured by UV absorption at 254 nm using a low pressure mercury lamp. This approach, which recently has been successfully marketed in for atmospheric measurements, gives adequate precision (q2 ppbv) and accuracy (q2%) for breath analysis. In addition to being small, light weight and having low power requirements, this new approach eliminates the need for gas standards contained in high pressure gas cylinders. The simplified ""stopped flow"" design proposed here eliminates the possibility of interference from major components in breath such as water vapor and carbon dioxide. Because of their slow reaction, VOCs such as isoprene also are not expected to interfere. In Phase I we will develop and test a prototype instrument that will be used in a clinical intercomparison with the FDA-approved NIOX apparatus for establishment of equivalency during Phase II.

However, it is believed that the video publishers are not able to fully capitalize on this massive online video trend because they are using a single source revenue model via Pre-, Mid- and Post-Roll advertising that has limited revenue opportunity, declining prices, and negative viewer experiences. 2Cimple is developing a solution, an Interactive Video Applications Platform that has the potential to increase a publisher's online video revenue. This platform, dynamically associates and pushes relevant interactive video applications to consumers while providing a ""user-controlled"" opt-in environment that results in a higher degree of viewer experience and engagement. The platform is built on flexible and scalable client-server architecture based on industry-standard technology components. The technology uniqueness includes a dynamically configurable Video Player, an application server capable of automatic video context detection and dynamic application insertion, an open application development platform, integrated video and application analytics, customized reports, and a simplified management system.
If successful, the platform has commercialization potential that introduces efficiency into the online video value chain by increasing revenue for publishers, optimizing budgets for sponsors, and providing a higher degree of engagement and enhanced viewing experience for consumers.

The detection (and localization) of a logic-based signature within a binary executable represents a significant advancement in automated code analysis. It also offers a new capability to test the hardness or vulnerability of protected software modules (e.g. test logic obfuscation hardness, vulnerability to exploitation, etc.). The approach taken involves the development of canonical signatures based on essential logic patterns required for a (malicious) function to occur. When logic patterns of certain malicious codes are extracted it is also possible to relate logic signatures to specific exploitive behaviors. This results in an OS/language/hardware independent signature for malicious exploits, strategies and tactics. We can then extract the logic structure from an arbitrary binary and scan it for specific malicious logic. Scanning a binary module requires disassembling and recovering features of the logical implementation (hence, it can potentially violate some software licensing agreements).

It will develop pattern classes that are associated with patterns of logic instructions present within actual malcode specimens. We expect malcode control flow logic patterns to cluster in `pattern space&#039; (i.e. revealing code logic pedigrees). This is because specific algorithmic logic must be used to effect specific behaviors. Specific exploits are achieved by specific behaviors.

This effort develops unique logic-based signatures of source code using syntax-independent control logic flow patterns. Control flow patterns yield specific detectable signatures that can be extracted from source code as well as binary code. Because they are based on functional control flow, the signatures are also related to functional behavior, thus, any modifications to the code that alter behavior also alter its logic signature - a source code will have the same signature as its binary despite the compiler used.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a behavioral approach that helps guide users through unhelpful
thoughts, feelings and urges. Using ACT, we have created and marketed highly successful self-management
programs for multiple disorders including chronic pain. Proposed Product: We have learned from our Chronic
Pain Self-Management Program that ACT reduces anxiety disorders and depression which typically accompany
chronic pain and provides the patient with coping strategies for managing their CP. These CP-associated
problems challenge primary care providers (PCPs) who do not have the capacity to manage the mental health
and behavioral components of chronic pain. To address these challenges, we will develop a new product, 2MRx-
CP, a Prescription Digital Therapeutic (PDT), that will combine our established ACT protocols for CP
management with screening tools for SUD, anxiety, and depression. It will also include: 1) behavioral science
content; and 2) remote patient monitoring (RPM) that evaluates CP patient outcome metrics and sends them to
a Provider Dashboard to inform PCPs. We are seeking a Fast-Track SBIR Application as 2Morrow has already
established itself in the digital health realm and will use their existing platforms to inform our 2MRx-CP product
development. Our 4 Phase I specific aims are: 1) Conduct a quantitative evaluation of the existing 2Morrow
Chronic Pain Self-Management Digital Health Program to address dissemination and implementation variables
of appropriateness, acceptability, and feasibility; 2) Conduct a qualitative study of PCP Core Teams to: a)
determine best fit PCP clinic types for 2MRx-CP for the Phase II clinical study andamp; our marketing strategy; and b)
initiate development of the Provider Dashboard; 3) To initiate development of our new prescription-based digital
program, 2MRx-CP, by reviewing data collected in Aims I-1 and 2, then developing a paper protocol of program
core elements; and 4) 2Morrow will contract consultants to complete an audit of our current quality management
processes and procedures to inform the formalized Phase II QMS implementation. Our 4 Phase II specific aims
are: 1) Conceptually design and build 2MRx-CP by incorporating the outcomes from Phase I to create final
content, screening tools, algorithms, and user experiences in an FDA compliant QMS IOS and Android mobile
application; 2) Conduct a clinical trial of 20 providers and 100 patients, as determined by our power analysis,
that will focus on impact of app use on change in primary patient reported outcomes and to describe patient
reported implementation outcomes: 1) patient outcomes on pain interference, function, depression, and anxiety,
and 2) implementation outcomes on acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, costs, and sustainability
of use by patients; and 4) Conduct Likert-based on-line surveys of PCP use of the Provider Dashboard each
month for 6 mos of the SA II-2 clinical study followed by tracking PCP post-study PDT use and by PCP interviews.2Morrow, Inc. SBIR Fast-Track Application â Project Narrative: 2Morrow is a small business established in

Commitment Therapy approach to address unhelpful thoughts, feelings, and urges to help patients reach their
health goals. Chronic pain patients are at risk for dependence, addiction and substance use disorder. We
propose to combine established methodologies of ACT for chronic pain with ACT based addiction tools and
content in a new prescription digital therapeutic, which is designed to assist primary care providers to screen,

Current RO purification systems require a high driving pressure mainly because of low water flux and fouling of the membranes. The proposed approach allows fabrication of highly cross-linked polyamide (PA) nanocomposite membranes with nanometer control over the film thickness, minimal roughness, uniform nanoparticle distribution, and defined local chemical and polymer composition. Compared with traditional reverse osmosis PA membranes, significant benefits can be expected from the proposed membrane including 2 to 3 times improvement in water flux, lower driving pressure, and less fouling and ease for cleaning.

However, the key challenge facing current aquatic phosphorus sensing technologies is lack of in-situ determination capability and poor long-term stability. These methods either require addition of reagent such as ascorbic acid to induce colorimetric change upon phosphate or need frequent calibration/replacement work caused by issue of ion leakage in electrochemistry. Thus, none of current methods have so far shown to be suitable to deploy in remote environments for in-situ monitoring aquatic phosphorus. To address these challenges, 2Witech Solutions LLC (2Witech) proposes a new generation of nanosensor based on radio frequency (RF) detection technology for in-situ monitoring of aquatic phosphorus. The construction of the proposed sensor is based on a designed single or multi band antenna coupled with interdigital electrodes that are modified with molecularly-imprinted single layer graphene sheet. Such innovative design combines selectivity of molecularly-imprinting and sensitivity of single layer graphene and imparts reagent-free and minimal calibration capability from RF detection method. In Phase I program, RF nanosensor based on single or multi band antenna will be developed. Such development will involve steps of molecularly-imprinting single layer graphene, combining with Rogers substrate as testing fixture, determination of phosphate-sensitive frequencies, and design and simulation of single or multi band antenna. This technology will have significant positive impact on fields related to environmental protection and human health. We anticipate broad use in fields of aquatic phosphorus determination such as monitoring enrichment process of water bodies, managing plant growth, determining water quality, and clinical diagnosis of various disorders and diseases like hyperparathyroidism, hypertension, vitamin D deficiency, mineral and bone disorder, Franconia syndrome and kidney failure. Our approach will provide a direct means of controlling corrective actions taken to control the levels of aquatic phosphorus that could affect environment and human health."

Typical commercial GCxGC instrumentation is too large to be appropriate for this application, however the use of microfabricated components allows us to reduce the size and power requirements of these instruments by several orders of magnitude. During Phase 1 we propose to develop a method to analyze the cetane number using a microfabricated GCXGC system with nanofabricated NEMS resonators for detection, optimize an algorithm for cetane number calculation, and demonstrate the system in a benchtop scale system.

This approach addresses the attackerâs tactic of network mapping and the assumption of a static network target. The architecture implementation uses virtual machine hypervisor technology to test and evaluate scenarios based on clearly defined metrics. While network nodes can be individual physical machines, our VM approach provides an architecture implementation that allows easy creation of different test configurations, such as multiple virtual network cards, virtual switch connections, varying operating system configurations. The results of the Phase I effort provide sufficient detail to demonstrate proof-of-concept and validate the feasibility of the envisioned system. BENEFIT: The agent-based attack-surface mutating network described in this proposal has very broad applicability. Many government and commercial organizations recognize the threat from network attacks. Since many of these attacks rely on profiling networks to discover services, this technology has the potential to protect vital networked assets through continual, dynamic mutation. Current architectures that implement static network configurations provide an easy and reliably fixed target of opportunity for the attacker. Areas such as military command and control networks, agencies involved in Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, scientific research, medical organizations, government contractors, and commercial companies are examples of organizations that can benefit from this technology."

Building on the research from the Phase I Ontology-based Security Classification Guide Investigation (OSCG-I), the prototype will show that a robust and accurate ontological approach can indeed overcome the complex issues related to this problem, and instead become an opportunity. Phase I focused on two areas of feasibility, 1) development of approaches for specifying a formal ontological open standard for the information contained in a security classification guide (SCG), including security classification rules, and validating the consistency whether a single, or multiple, ontology-based SCGs apply to a given situation, and 2) tools to facilitate and automate creation of SCG and the inherent security classification rules. Phase II will focus on building an enhanced prototype suite of tools to demonstrate the benefits of automated SCG creation and maintenance to provide more rapid and agile responses to dynamic environments. BENEFIT: Our advantage over existing methods is that OSCG assists users in the creation, maintenance, and application of security classification management through the entire SCG lifecycle. This will result in increased efficiency, lower cost, and most importantly increased security. Since the ontology captures the relationships among the SCG component items, the OSCG system automatically checks for consistency within the SCG by capturing SCG components using a formally defined and verifiable ontology. Another advantage to our approach is reusability. Many SCGs have relationships and references that are similar within a hierarchy of security regulations. Our approach, further developed in Phase II, allows existing security classification regulations and documents to be easily incorporated into new SCGs. This reuse capability, along with consistency validation, will help ensure that existing and validated regulations are incorporated and propagated correctly during the SCG lifecycle. We can envision this approach as a strong complement to cross-domain solutions. Above any other benefit is that, wherever warfighters are, secure information at the right level of detail and appropriately accessed or disseminated can greatly increase the efficiency of their activities."

Logistical and systemic barriers have long impeded access to mental health services for youth with emotional
distress (e.g., depression and anxiety) resulting in a troubling gap where fewer than 50% of youth with an
emotional disorder actually receive any mental health services, much less evidence-based intervention
strategies. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, youth are experiencing heightened emotional distress as
faced with social isolation, familial financial strain, and fewer supports by peers and schools, making the need
for scalable, accessible, and feasible mental health supports more urgent than ever. Single-Session
Interventions (SSIs) have been shown to be an effective means for reducing youth psychopathology and to
effectively lower cost, time, and stigma barriers to mental health treatment. Through this SBIR, we will apply the
Unified Protocol (UP) transdiagnostic principles for emotional disorders in youths to create a suite of digital, self-
paced, and evidence-based SSI modules for youth with a range of emotional disorders. Our end product will
utilize cutting-edge software to offer youth a significantly enhanced experience compared to existing (research-
focused) digital SSIs. No digital (self-administered) SSI product currently exists that offers the proposed unique
combination of content and digital interactivity and personalization.
This 12-month SBIR Phase I project will accomplish three specific aims: (1) develop a software prototype
containing two fully-functioning SSI modules: âAwareness of Physical Sensations and Emotional Experienceâ
and âBeing Flexible in Your Problem-Solvingâ; (2) conduct usability and acceptability testing with youth who
screen as having elevated emotional disorder symptoms; and (3) conduct feasibility testing with stakeholders
who commonly oversee or support youth mental health (school- and community-based mental health providers,
after-school counselors, pediatric healthcare providers, and parents). The proposed SBIR project will address
the need for innovative cost- and time-efficient access to evidence-based mental health services for youth
experiencing emotional distress. Phase I development will be guided by iterative user-centered design and
testing. We expect Phase I to provide sufficient evidence of the feasibility and promise of our proposed product
to support continued development and efficacy testing in Phase II. The overarching goal of this work is to support
broad scale dissemination and use of digital SSI modules to reach as many youth as possible with evidence-
based mental health supports.Project Narrative
The United States spends more money on mental health services than any other country, yet access to
effective psychological services remains strikingly low, particularly for Americaandapos;s youth. Fewer than 50% of
adolescents experiencing emotional disorder symptoms (depression, anxiety) receive any mental health
treatment, highlighting a troubling discrepancy between need for and access to youth mental health services.
This SBIR Phase I proposal will develop and test the acceptability and feasibility of a new suite of digital

Demand for effective tools to ensure students are safe at school has increased as a result of high-profile school
shootings and a greater awareness of violence on school grounds. Current research underscores the importance
of school climate as an essential protective factor against violence. A positive school climate fosters student
engagement, academic performance, and mental health. Further, when school climate improves, suspensions,
office referrals, and violent and aggressive behaviors among students decrease. The goal of this SBIR is to
develop and test the School Assessment for Environmental Typography (SAfETy) software product for schools
and school districts. We will build on our teamâs empirically validated school climate assessment instrument to
create a digital interactive tool that can be easily integrated with typical administrative âwalkthroughâ procedures.
SAfETy will streamline collection of observations of the schoolâs physical and social environment, implement
algorithms to deliver data-driven climate improvement suggestions, and facilitate creation and monitoring of
corrective action plans to address climate concerns. In Phase I, we will create a software prototype and conduct
user-centered tests with target end users (e.g., school administrators) to determine feasibility of the proposed
SAfETy product. Phase I quantitative and qualitative data will be used to inform the Phase II Randamp;D plan. The end
result will be a rigorously tested new digital solution to help school personnel improve school climate and safety
and address a legal requirement for reporting that schools currently have but for which few tools exist. The
proposed SAfETy product will also address a significant public health need for feasible and effective tools to
improve school safety and will offer an innovative scalable technology solution to the substantial school district
market of more than 132,000 independent governing agencies.Narrative
A positive school climate has been linked to improved student engagement, academic self-concept, mental
health and standardized test results. Additionally, it has been associated with a breadth of student behavioral
outcomes that are related to achievement and safety, including absenteeism, truancy, dropout, suspension, drug
use, and violent and aggressive behavior. The proposed SBIR project will directly address the need for a data-
driven decision making tool that can be easily administered and support effective corrective actions to improve
school climate and reduce violence."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive condition, characterized by an irreversible deterioration of renal
function that gradually progresses to end-stage renal disease, requiring dialysis or kidney transplant. CKD and
its co-morbidities (e.g., hypertension, anemia, acidosis, and metabolic bone disease) require strict treatment
adherence to halt progression and improve outcomes. Unfortunately, the majority of pediatric patients with
CKD do not adhere to their medical regimen. This non-adherence can have devastating consequences such
as renal failure, kidney transplant rejection, and even death. Research underscores how a lack of information
or misinformation undermines adherence, and how static educational materials are not sufficient to ensure
adherence to treatment. In order to optimize adherence, there is a need for educational programs to include a
behavioral self-management component. Moreover, web-based tools are well accepted among CKD patients
and online education has been shown to significantly improve health outcomes for adults with chronic illness.
Leveraging a unique combination of synchronized web and mobile applications, this 3 year SBIR Phase II
project will fully develop and pilot test My Kidney Guruâa program that will offer pediatric patients with CKD
developmentally appropriate, interactive, and engaging instruction and practice opportunities to build
knowledge and skills to manage CKD. The contextually-relevant program will include personalized tools for
self-monitoring and self-management including coping strategies for managing psychological and psychosocial
aspects of a chronic condition. The proposed project will accomplish three specific aims: (1) Fully develop the
program, including nine modules, using an iterative user-centered development-testing-revision process to
ensure the software achieves optimal usability for intended end users. (2) Conduct a pilot efficacy study to
assess the programâs impact for improving adolescentsâ CKD and self-management knowledge, treatment
adherence, transition readiness, self-management skills, self-efficacy, and quality of life. Adolescents with CKD
will complete the nine modules over a 6-month intervention period. Parents of adolescents will review the
parent module at the beginning of the trial and the youth modules at the end of the trial. We expect
adolescents to report significant improvements in all areas. Lastly, we will (3) prepare the product for
commercialization by conducting focus groups with healthcare providers to review the program and gather
feedback regarding implementation in healthcare delivery settings. In preparation for Phase III commercial
launch, we will finalize revisions and reporting functions, and integrate e-commerce functions into the website.
The proposed My Kidney Guru program will directly address the need for innovative solutions to effectively
increase treatment adherence using a dynamic education and self-management program designed specifically
to meet the needs of adolescents with CKD. Greater adherence and self-management skill will translate into
significant benefits in the well-being of these youth, including lower risk for medical complications and mortality.Project Narrative
Disease knowledge, self-management skills, and self-awareness have been shown to be poor for pediatric
patients with CKD, representing major impediments to independent self-care and consistent adherence to
treatment, which in turn result in suboptimal health outcomes. My Kidney Guru will offer pediatric patients with
CKD (a) developmentally appropriate, interactive, and engaging instruction and practice opportunities to build
knowledge and skills to manage CKD, and (b) contextually-relevant and personalized tools for self-monitoring
and self-management including coping strategies for managing the psychological and psychosocial stress of a
chronic condition."

However, despite availability, evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for prevention of ATOD use are rarely adopted in everyday practice within school and community service settings. Further, even when adopted, these EBIs are seldom implemented with strong adherence to the original design and often fail to be sustained over time. A growing body of literature demonstrates how implementation quality is directly related to the likelihood an EBI will be embedded into everyday practice, as well as the likelihood that the EBI achieves its intended treatment outcomes. The most effective EBI will not produce positive results if it is not implemented with quality and sustained within its real-world service setting. NIDA's Strategic Plan specifically identifies the need for effective methods to help close the gap between development of evidence-based prevention initiatives and their adoption and long-term sustainability in school and community service settings. The goal of this Phase I SBIR project is to test the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of incorporating ATOD EBIs into a web-based tool (Centervention) currently designed to support dissemination and quality implementation of mental health EBIs for youth within school settings. This flexible technology infrastructure offers a suite ofcustomizable online tools and services, including cost-efficient, high quality training and supervision resources, ongoing implementation assistance for intervention providers, adherence monitoring, and outcomes tracking that might be applicable to ATOD EBIs within school and community service settings. Three specific aims will be accomplished through Phase I of this project: (1) an example ATOD EBI (Project CHOICE) will be incorporated into the Centervention framework to establish needed modifications fordissemination of ATOD EBIs; (2) a feasibility test of the Project CHOICE prototype will be conducted with stakeholder groups; and (3) based on Phase I findings and recommendations, a plan for incorporating and testing the dissemination of multiple ATOD EBIs during Phase II will be generated. The primary commercial application will be a technology infrastructure that provides tools and services specifically designed to support quality implementation of ATOD EBIs within school- or community-based service settings. If successful in increasing the likelihood that ATOD EBIs are adopted, used as intended, and sustained in everyday practice, the proposed product offers the potential for significant societal benefits.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTHRELEVANCE: Over the past several decades, a large number of evidence-based prevention initiatives for alcohol, tobacco, and other drug (ATOD) use have been rigorously tested and shown to be efficacious [1-3]. Federal and state policies as well as lists published by federal agencies, such as SAMHSA's National Registry of Evidence- based Programs and Practices, have attempted to increase EBI use [4, 5] However, despite availability, evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for prevention of ATOD use are rarely adopted in everyday practice within school and community service settings [6-9]. Further, even when adopted, these EBIs are seldom implemented with strong adherence to the original design [6] and often fail to be sustained over time [8, 10, and 11]. A growing body of literature demonstrates how implementation quality is directly related to the likelihood an EBI will be embedded into everyday practice, as well as the likelihood that the EBI achieves its intended treatment outcomes [12-14]. The most effective EBI will not produce positive results if it is not implemented with quality and sustained within its real-world service setting.

The proposed project will leverage 3-C's technological expertise and experience to create a flexible, scalable technology infrastructure applicable to ATOD EBIs on a broad scale in order to effectively decrease costs (time, personnel) to both providers and intervention developers, enhance the quality with which ATOD EBIs are implemented, and increase dissemination of ATOD EBIs intoreal world everyday practice. If successful in increasing the likelihood that ATOD EBIs are adopted, used as intended, and sustained in everyday practice, the proposed product offers the potential for significant societal benefits."

Between 9.5% and 14.2% of young children experience social-emotional problems that negatively impact school-readiness, and nearly half of children with significant behavior problems at school entry demonstrate more serious behavioral and academic difficulties throughout elementary school and into adolescence. Moreover, children from disadvantaged backgrounds and those with emotional-behavioral challenges are likely to experience school transition problems. Evidence supports the value of parent-centered interventions for fostering positive child adjustment across this pivotal transition period. Increasing parents' skills and confidence in applying effective transition strategies with their child translates into positive adjustment outcomes for children, yet there isa dearth of evidence-based, easy to access programs that parents can use to facilitate their child's successful transition to formal schooling. The proposed SBIR project will directly address this critical issue by developing and testing a specialized online intervention for parents of children in early childhood designed to promote children's schoolreadiness and successful transition to school. ParentWays for Early Childhood (PWEC) will be an innovative online parent training intervention that provides parents with effective psychoeducational resources and tools to help promote their child's schoolsuccess while also fostering parental involvement and positive family-school relationships. Grounded in the Developmental Model of school transitions (Pianta and Kraft-Sayre, 2003), this Phase I project will accomplish three aims: (1) create the Phase I PWEC prototype with three training modules (Introduction, Transition to School, Parenting for Success) built on 3-C ISD's proprietary web-based platform for self-paced dynamic learning with hands-on interactive practice exercises; (2) conduct feasibility testing with key stakeholders, including childcare/daycare professionals (n=30), early childhood education professionals (n=30), and parents of children ages 3-5 (n=30); and (3) establish a detailed Phase II development and testing plan based on Phase I findings. Phase I research is expected to demonstrate strong support for the proposed product. With this foundation, Phase II full product development will begin followed by a randomized clinical trial examining treatment benefits for (1) parenting knowledge and self-efficacy and (2) child social skills, school adjustment, and emotional functioning across the school transition period. Through Phase II testing, the proposed product is expected to effectively increase parents' knowledge, self-efficacy, and skillsfor helping their child successfully transition to grade school. This intervention product will yield a commercially viable and valuable resource for a wide variety of parents, as well as early education professionals who work closely with parents of young children, to support the start of formal school.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Social-emotional skills play a central role in young children's school readiness and successful transition to formal schooling. Approximately half of children with significant behavior problems at school entry are expected to demonstrate more serious behavioral and academic difficulties throughout elementary school and into adolescence. Despite 25 billion currently spent by states and the federalgovernment for childcare and preschool programs, significant gaps in school readiness are found for low-income and minority preschool- aged children that often persist and relate to later school failure and a host of negative outcomes (e.g., teen pregnancy, engagement in criminal activities, clinical depression) [83]. Although the importance of school readiness cannot be overstated, few cost-effective, accessible, scientifically-validated interventions have been developed to provide parents with the knowledge and skills to help their children successfully transition to school. Web-based programs are an increasingly feasible way to disseminate information and interventions, given nearly 80% of US households have in-home internet access with a significant increase in Internet access for rural populations and low-income households. The proposed SBIR project will address the need for cost- effective, accessible, scientifically-validated programs for school readiness and early school success by developing and testing a specialized online psychoeducation program for parents of children ages 3-5 years. This program will provide guidance and support for parents to help them promote the successful transition to school for their young children while also building strong, positive connections between families and the school setting."

Research suggests that a key componentof a successful transition from pediatric care into adult-focused health care systems is proper management of treatment regimens [1]. Unfortunately, treatment adherence among adolescents with chronic illness is disappointingly low, with poor adherence found in 50-70% of all patients [2]. Reviews of adherence studies indicate the risk of treatment nonadherence declines with greater disease- and treatment-related knowledge and that providing a behavioral management component optimizes adherence [8-10]. The goal of this Phase II SBIR project is to continue the research and development of the Online Medical Monitoring System (OMMS), an integrated online and mobile technology infrastructure specifically designed to (a) enhance youths' disease- and treatment-related knowledge through interactive and game-based educational materials; (b) support adherence to the treatment regimen through customized task prompts via mobile and web-based delivery; and (c) promote patient-provider communication through real-world datacollection and synchronized feedback loops. During Phase II, we will build on Phase I feedback to finalize the fully functioning product and conduct a field test examining the degree to which the OMMS enhances treatment adherence outcomes among adolescents with a variety of chronic illnesses. This Phase II project will accomplish three specific aims: 1) fully develop the OMMS product; 2) conduct a field test of the benefits of the OMMS with adolescents with chronic illness; and 3) finalize the OMMS and ready for broad scale commercialization. To our knowledge, the OMMS will be the first technology product that integrates educational, adherence tracking, and patient-provider communication tools into one comprehensive, streamlined package. We expect the OMMSto effectively provide essential information and much needed support to youth with chronic illness to help them successfully negotiate their treatment regimen and transition into self-managed healthcare.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical non-adherence has been identified as a major public health problem among youth that imposes a considerable financial burden upon modern healthcare systems [3-7]. Because of the complexities in measuring adherence, no estimate can be generalized, but poor adherence is to be expected in 50-70% of all adolescent patients with chronic illness, irrespective of disease, prognosis, or setting [4, 6, 8-10]. This burden has been estimated to cost 100 billion each year in the United States [5], including 10% of hospital admissions [4, 6]. Adherence is also critical to the integrity of clinical research findings to preserve sufficient statistical power for analysis and to minimize the potential for obscured findings. Indeed, as clinician's increasinglyrely on treatment protocols that are based on clinica trial evidence, it is critical to address adherence in the realm of research as well [11-16]. The proposed Online Medical Monitoring System (OMMS) would remove barriers to adherence monitoring and provide significant advantages in convenience and utility over existing clinical options."

However, despite availability, evidence-based interventions (EBIs) are rarely adopted in everyday practice within community MH service settings. Further, even when adopted, MH EBIs are seldom implemented with strong adherence to the original design and often fail to be sustained over time. A growing body of literature demonstrates how implementation quality is directly related to the likelihood an EBI will be embedded into everyday clinical practice as well as the likelihood that EBI achieves its intended treatment outcomes. As outlined in NIMH's Strategic Plan, innovative methods to help close the gap between development of research-tested interventions and their widespread use are critically needed. This Phase II SBIR project will continue research and development of the Web- Based Dissemination Tool for Community Mental Health (WDT-C), a flexible technology infrastructure specifically designed to foster quality implementation of MH EBIs within community MH service settings on a broad scale. WDT-C will offer a suite of customizable online toolsand services, including cost-efficient high quality training and supervision resources, ongoing implementation assistance for providers, adherence monitoring, and outcomes tracking. Prototype development and feasibility testing with key stakeholders weresuccessfully completed in Phase I, providing substantial support for the product as well as specific recommendations for Phase II development. Three specific aims will be accomplished through this Phase II project. The first aim is to develop the full technology infrastructure utilizing Phase I feedback, and apply it to a third, independent MH EBI. To ensure maximal quality and make any needed adjustments prior to product testing, usability of this new WDT-C application will be assessed by community MH administrators and providers. The second aim is to conduct a scientific evaluation of WDT-C. Each of the three WDT-C supported EBIs will be implemented by community MH providers randomly assigned to either Implementation-As-Usual (no WDT-C support) or EnhancedImplementation (WDT-C supported implementation) conditions. Differences between conditions will be tested in five implementation outcome areas: (a) organizational readiness for intervention implementation, (b) adherence to intervention protocol, (c) satisfaction with intervention and implementation support, (d) sustainability of intervention, and (e) treatment benefits. The final aim is to finalize all product components based on Phase II findings and evaluations in preparation for Phase III commercialization. This SBIR project will yield a flexible, scalable technology infrastructure that can be applied to any community MH EBI to effectively decrease costs (time, financial, personnel) to both providers and intervention developers, enhance the quality withwhich EBIs are implemented in community settings, and increase dissemination of EBIs into  real world  everyday practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Each year in the U.S., about 6 percent of youth and 13 percent of adults receive some form of mental health (MH) care, at an annual cost of more than 112 billion [1, 2]. In addition, each year NIMH and other foundations fund more than 785 million for MH research, much of it devoted to treatment studies [3]. Unfortunately, it currently takes an average of 17 years for clinical research findings, such as those generated by randomized control trials, to be used regularly in clinical practice [4]. As a result, the current state of MH care in the United States lags far behind the current state of its research knowledge base. As the mental health research-practice gap has become increasingly evident, numerous federal reports have called for action to better connect research findings to clinical practice (e.., The President's New Freedom Commission Report [5]; Reports of the Surgeon General on Mental Health [6], Youth Violence [7], and Culture, Race, and Ethnicity [8]; Institute of Medicine [9] and the National Children's Call to Action [10]). Building on the recommendations of clinical and research communitymembers during the  Enhancing the Discipline of Clinical and Translational Sciences  meeting (May, 2005), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) identified research efforts to bridge science and practice as the primary objective of NIH's roadmap. The proposed research directly addresses this NIH Roadmap priority as well as these federal calls for action. The findings from the proposed research will advance our understanding of how to successfully integrate MH evidence-based interventions (EBIs) into everyday practice within community MH service settings. Increasing the likelihood that EBIs will be adopted, used as intended, and sustained in everyday practice, in turn, will increase the likelihood that society at large will benefit from evidence-based practices."

NIH's broad mission to improve health outcomes for all people can only be achieved if scientific advances are transformed into improvements in public health. As emphasized throughout the NIH Roadmap, there is a critical need to build our nation's research capacity for clinical and translational research so that findings can be more quickly and effectively translated into clinica practice. This Phase II SBIR project will continue the research and development of Research Implementation and Management System (RIMS), the first integrated system of online research tools specifically designed to meet the needs of clinical and translational scientists in the socia and behavioral fields. Through efficient, cost- effective, and tailored research implementation and management tools, RIMS will harness the Internet's power to effectively increase research capacity. RIMS will integrate and streamline all needed research activities from recruitment and retention to human participant protections to data collection and database management. RIMS will be broadly applicable, providing customizable tools that can be easily integrated into a research protocol. Further, RIMS' online tools are built on robust, HIPAA-compliant data security standards. No other product provides a comprehensive suite of integrated research implementation and management tools tailored to the needs of social/behavioral researchers. Phase I feasibility test results with researchers provide strong support for continued development and testing of RIMS. During Phase II, we will build on Phase I feedback to finalize the fully functioning web-based product and conduct a field test examining the degree to which RIMS enhances the quality, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of clinical and translational research. This Phase II project will accomplish three specific aims: 1) Full product development and usability testing with clinical and translational researchers in the social and behavioral sciences (PIs, Project Coordinators, and Research Staff; n=20 per group); 2) Field testing in collaboration with 12 research teams to examine the impact of RIMS over a 6-month period in cost-effectiveness, time efficiency, recruitment and retention, data quality, and satisfaction; and 3) finalizing the product based on test results and user evaluations. Over the course of 3-C ISD's work with research scientists, it has become clear there is a large unmet need and demand for web-based research management tools, particularly in social and behavioral fields (see letters of support). By making such technologies affordable and broadly applicable,RIMS has the potential to significantly advance the research capacity of clinical and translational research through high quality, time-efficient, and cost-effective research management and implementation tools. As a result, our nation's ability to transform research findings into improved health outcomes can be strengthened and accelerated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: NIH's mission to improve health outcomes for all people emphasizes the need to accelerate and strengthen clinical and translational research. Technology can play a vital role in achieving this goal through web-based tools for researchers that allow them to conduct, disseminate, and translate their research more efficiently and with higher quality. Currently, comprehensive web-based tools are rarely used in the service of clinical or translational research in the social and behavioral sciences. Social and behavioral research plays a critical role in advancing the understanding and prevention of public health problems, both at the individual level (e.g., drug and alcohol abuse) and at the systems level (e.g., health economics, delivery systems). The treatment and prevention of diabetes, obesity, drug abuse, violence, and myriad other public health concerns depend on good research that is conducted cost-effectively and translated efficiently. The proposed Research Implementation Management System (RIMS) will offer a suite of online research tools to streamline the various activities needed to conduct clinical and translational research in thesocial and behavioral sciences, including recruitment, retention, human participant protections, measure construction, data collection, and database management. This product will be developed and tested in response to the needs of clinical and translational researchers across a broad array of social and behavioral fields. The underlying web-based technology infrastructure of RIMS will be broadly applicable, providing customizable tools that can be easily integrated into a research protocol. RIMS will bridge geographic barriers by giving researchers with fewer institutional supports for research equal access to affordable, flexible technology. In effect, this SBIR will be able to support the research of scientists across multiple NIH Institutes, with particular relevanc for the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institute on Aging (NIA), and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). Bringing the RIMS product to market would broadly support NIH's mission to improve public health outcomes through strengthening capacity of clinical and translational science."

Although NSSI is associated with other mental health problems (e.g., depression, anxiety, disordered eating) and is a risk factor for suicide and severe unintended injury, evidence-based treatment and prevention models for NSSI are scarce. In addition, few resources are available for parents despite evidence of their important role in youth's recovery from self- harming behaviors. Factors such as parents' basic knowledge of NSSI and youth developmental processes, as well as parents' own emotion and communication skills, have a direct impact on a young person's recovery process. However, engaging parents in their child's recovery process can be challenging due to barriers for families (e.g., time, stigma regarding the self-injury behavior) and clinicians (e.g., balancing youth and parent needs). A web-based psychoeducation program provides a mechanism for overcoming these barriers in order to provide parents with education, skills and support to help their children. The proposed SBIR project will develop and test Parent Education and Resources for Self-injurious Youth (PERSY), a specialized web-based program for parents of youth who are receiving treatment for NSSI. Through this SBIR Phase I grant, we will develop a prototype of PERSY and conduct feasibility and usability testing to gather feedback from key stakeholders prior to full product development. Three specific aims will be accomplished in this Phase I project: (1) creating the PERSY prototype including three web-based modules and outlines of the accompanying program materials; (2) conducting stakeholder feasibility and usability tests of the PERSY prototype to assess the feasibility, usability, innovation, and quality with 30 mental health professionals and 30 parents of 12-20 year olds in clinical treatment for NSSI; and (3) establish final prototype specifications using data compiled and analyzed from the feasibility testing. PERSY will include a range of web-based modalities including video presentations, didactic education, interactive self-assessments, social skill modeling, and personalizedfeedback. To our knowledge, no other product exists that provides this type of knowledge enhancement, skill development, and support to parents of youth with NSSI. Phase I research is expected to demonstrate strong support for the proposed product acrossstakeholders and provide the necessary foundation for full product development. Once the PERSY program is finalized in Phase II, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial to examine treatment effects for (1) parenting knowledge, skills, and positive engagement with their child, (2) youth self-injury recovery, and (3) youth positive engagement with parents. This SBIR project will be instrumental in establishing PERSY as an efficacious competitor in the psychoeducation marketplace. The final product will serve as a valuable resource for parents and mental health professionals with the potential to have a significant impact on the lives of youth with NSSI and their families. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) such as cutting, burning, and embedding objects under the skin is an increasingly common self-harming behavior among adolescents and young adults. Current estimates of rates of NSSI in youth range from 12-37% in secondary school populations and 12-25% in young adult populations. NSSI is associated with other serious mental health problems including depression, anxiety, and disordered eating and is a potent risk factor for suicide and severe unintended injury. Mental health problems come with a devastatingly high financial cost and are thus considered a serious public health issue. In the U.S., the annual direct costs associated with mental health treatment are estimated at 57.5 billion, with the overall costs of mental illness significantly higher (e.g., disability, unemployment). Each year, about 4.6 million children receive some form of mental health (MH) care, with higher average costs of care for youth as compared to average costs for the general population. The President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health specifically calls for the identification and early treatment of youth who may experience mental health problems to prevent the onset of co-occurring disorders and other negative outcomes. In addition, multiple research studies have shown that parents play a critical role in youth mental health care. Parents' roles are both instrumental (i.e., detecting a problem, seeking out a treatment provider, coordinating treatment) and supportive (i.e., monitoring youth between sessions, reinforcing therapy concepts outside of the session). Given the direct costs associated with psychiatric disorders and use of mental health services, it is especially important to develop and test innovative programs for parents. These programs can support parents in promoting optimal outcomesin their youth in order to overcome NSSI and reduce overall mental health treatment costs. Despite its increasing prevalence, the known negative outcomes associated with NSSI, and knowledge of parents' role in youth recovery, evidence-based treatments forparents of youth with NSSI are lacking. The proposed SBIR project directly addresses this critical treatment gap by developing and testing a web-based psychoeducation program designed to meet the education and support needs of parents of adolescents and young adults with NSSI."

School dropout has negative individual (e.g., increased likelihood of risky behaviors and decreased annual earnings) and societal repercussions (e.g., greater dependency on social services). African American and Latino youth, particularly those represented in lower socioeconomic status (SES) groups, are more likely to drop out of school than their White and higher SES counterparts. Research suggests that youth at risk for dropping out of school may not understand the link between current school performance and future success and, as a result, do not place a high value on school achievement. The proposed SBIR project, See It, Be It, will develop and test an innovative intervention that aids youth in forming school-based possible selves (i.e., cognitive representations of an individual's aspirations and goals). See It, Be It offers interactive softwar through which students create personalized stories about their short and long-term goals and the strategies needed to meet these goals. By creating stories and visualizing their successful school-based possible selves, students will better understand the link between current school performance and future success, and their cognitions about educational utility will change. Phase I will accomplish three aims: (1) create the Phase I prototypeincluding one storyline, sample technology components such as an Online Implementation Center (OIC), and accompanying implementation materials (i.e., manual for school professionals); (2) assess prototype feasibility with school professionals (n=30) and both feasibility and pre-post knowledge gained with youth at risk for dropping out of school (n=20); and (3) establish the Phase II development plan based on Phase I findings. Phase I research is expected to demonstrate strong support for the proposed product. With this foundation, Phase II full product development will include a randomized trial examining treatment effects for (1) students' classroom engagement, (2) academically focused cognitions, and (3) academic self-concept. Through Phase II testing, the proposed product is expected to effectively increase students' classroom engagement, academically-focused cognitions, and academic self-concept. This intervention product will yield a valuable and cost-effective resource for school professionals and at-risk youth thereby addressing large market demands, and has the potential to make a significant impact on the lives of youth at risk for school dropout and on society, in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the United States alone, approximately 7,000 students drop out of school each day. School dropout poses serious individual and societal risks. Dropouts obtain lower skilled and lower paying jobs than high school graduates and are more likely to report drug use than those who complete high school. Additionally, school dropouts make up the majority of welfare recipients and prison inmates. The substantial risk associated with dropping out of school has led to a critical public health need that must be addressed through the development and dissemination of effective treatment programs. The President of the United States designated 900 million in FY 2011 to help low-performing high schools decrease their dropout rates, underscoring the critical need to address this public health crisis. To date, mostdropout interventions have focused on high school students. Research suggests that school disengagement begins well before high school. Also, while many of these programs offer mentor support and tutoring, once the program ends, students often revert to their original and often negative beliefs about academic success and school utility. The proposed SBIR project will address the shortcomings of current dropout intervention programs by developing and testing a specialized computer- based intervention for at-risk middle school youth. One of the primary goals of the intervention is to influence the cognitions youth hold about the utility of school. The proposed product will also significantly increase at-risk students' classroom engagement and academic self-concept."

However, the past two decades have witnessed a significant decline in the clinical scientist workforce, which threatens our nation's ability to leverage advances in basic biomedical and behavioral sciences into improvements in public health. The transition to independent scientist is a particularly high-risk period for attrition from the research career path. Early career researchers face a variety of challenges when beginning their career and many of the skills needed to successfully establish and maintain a research career are not well taught during formal training. The need for and value of training in career navigation skills, such as planning, negotiation,and management, has been increasingly recognized. However, current attempts to bridge this educational gap tend to be either generic, static written materials which are limited in their utility for a given researcher or in-person workshops that are available to only a limited number of select trainees. The primary goal of this SBIR project is to create an interactive software product that provides individualized training and practice in career navigation skills to clinical and translational scientists on abroad scale. Through this software, recent advances in intelligent tutoring systems will be integrated so that researchers can actively participate in specific career challenges (e.g., negotiating salary) within a private, computer-based environment. ThisPhase I application will accomplish four specific aims: (1) gather recommendations through literature searches and interviews with highly experienced scientists who are actively engaged in training researchers in order to identify specific challenges facedby early career clinical and translational researchers as they transition to independent scientist, specific skills associated with success in career planning, negotiation, and management, and current best practices in career development training; (2) create the software prototype based on these recommendations and best practices; (3) conduct stakeholder feasibility test with independent researchers and early career researchers; and (4) use feasibility data to generate the Phase II development plan with acomplete list of training modules and challenge areas to be included in the full software product. Phase I research is expected to demonstrate strong support for the interactive software product across stakeholders and essential feedback to guide Phase IIdevelopment and testing.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: NIH's broad mission to improve health outcomes for all people emphasizes the need to accelerate and strengthen clinical and translational research. The significant decline in the clinical scientist workforce over the past two decades threatens our nation's ability to quickly and effectively translate advances in biomedical and behavioral sciences into public healthcare improvements. NIH's success depends upon the ability to train and retain future generations of clinical and translational researchers. In response, NCRR's Strategic Priorities stress the need for innovative methods to enhance the training, advancement, and retention of clinical and translational scientists. This SBIR project addresses this high priority through development and testing of an innovative interactive software product to provide individualized training and practice in key career navigation skills within a private, computer-based environment. If successful, the resulting tool could significantly impact public health by broadly disseminating vital training and practice opportunities to foster retention and career advancement of clinical and translational scientists."

Concomitant with immense internal shifts, adolescent peer relations become increasingly complex (e.g., cliques) and challenging (e.g., peer pressure) and, as teens struggle to define their young adult role, relationships within the family can become increasingly strained and conflictual. When youth experience difficulties navigating the transitions of adolescence, they are at heightened risk for developing a variety of mental health disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety), maladaptive behavior patterns (e.g., self-destructive or risk-taking behaviors) and academic failure. Parents are often at a loss for how to communicate with their teento help them through the turmoil of adolescence. The resulting elevated levels of parental stress not only negatively impacts adolescent adjustment, but also places parents at heightened risk for their own mental health problems, particularly depression.This Phase II SBIR project will continue the research and development (RandD) of a unique parent training intervention product, the Parent Guide to Adolescent Social-Behavioral Development (PGA). PGA is specifically designed to help parents learn and practice strategies to effectively help their teen through the interpersonal struggles of adolescence (with peers and family members). PGA will help parents learn how to work collaboratively with their adolescent to achieve social goals, thereby building parental confidence, reducing related parental stress, and enhancing parent-teen communication. The full PGA product will offer manualized, structured scripts for 12 parent group sessions, a wide array of written, video, and web-based intervention materials forparents, and a variety of online professional development and implementation support resources for providers. Once the program is finalized, a scientific evaluation of its efficacy will be conducted. Parents will be randomly assigned to PGA treatment (TX)or attention control (AC) conditions (n=72 each). Efficacy will be evaluated by examining changes in (a) parent understanding of social issues facing adolescents and social problem solving skills; (b) parental self-efficacy for helping their teen; (c) parenting stress; (d) adolescent social and behavioral functioning; and (e) quality of the parent-teen relationship (e.g., communication, conflict) as a function of treatment condition. We expect the TX condition to show significant positive change in each outcome area versus the AC condition which is expected to show little to no change. PGA will be a highly unique, innovative product that will fill a niche in the intervention marketplace not currently filled through any other commercialized product. This SBIRwill yield a valuable resource for providers and parents with the potential to make a significant impact on the lives of adolescents and their families."

The effectiveness of MH programs has been repeatedly demonstrated for a wide array of MH problems, including behavioral and emotional disorders, substance abuse, ADHD, and suicidality. However, despite their availability, as well as recent education and federal financial incentives for use of programs supported by empirical evidence, MH evidence-based interventions (EBIs) are rarely used in everyday practice by schools. Further, school MH EBIs that have proven effective under strict research conditions often fail to achieve their intended outcomes when delivered in the real world . A wealth of research indicates the quality of EBIimplementation is directly related to 1) the likelihood the intervention will be integrated and sustained within the school setting and 2) the strength of its treatment effects. The goal of this Phase II SBIR is to continue the research and development ofCenterVention, a web-based technology infrastructure designed to promote broad-scale quality implementation of school MH EBIs. CenterVention will provide cost-effective high quality training, on-going implementation assistance, intervention resources, andadherence monitoring to support EBI implementation and sustainability within schools. Phase I prototype development and feasibility testing with key stakeholders were successfully completed, providing substantial support for the CenterVention product as well as specific recommendations for Phase II development. The first aim of Phase II is to revise each CenterVention component to enhance its usability and value. Once the full technology infrastructure is complete, we will integrate a third, independent school MH EBI and examine the usability of this new CenterVention application with school MH providers, teachers, administrators, and intervention developers. The second aim of Phase II is to conduct a rigorous, longitudinal test of the CenterVention productcomparing two randomized conditions: Implementation-As-Usual (IAU; i.e., traditional EBI implementation with no CenterVention support) and Enhanced Implementation (EI; i.e., CenterVention-supported implementation). Five implementation outcomes will be examined: (1) readiness for EBI implementation, (2) adherence to EBI protocol, (3) satisfaction with the EBI and its implementation support, (4) sustainability of the EBI over time, and (5) treatment benefits for students. The third aim of Phase II is to finalize all product components based on Phase II findings and evaluations and prepare CenterVention for Phase III commercialization. This SBIR project will yield a flexible, scalable technology infrastructure that can be applied to any school MH EBI to effectively decrease costs (time, financial, personnel) to both schools and intervention developers, enhance the integrity with which EBIs are implemented in the school setting, and increase dissemination of EBIs into real world everyday practice. The proposed WDT not only offers the potential for significant societal benefits, but also addresses a large, currently untapped market.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As the mental health research-practice gap has become increasingly evident, numerous federal reports have called for action to better connect research findings to clinical practice (e.g., The President's New Freedom Commission Report [1]; Reports of the Surgeon General on Mental Health [2], Youth Violence [3], and Culture, Race, and Ethnicity [4]; and theNational Children's Call to Action [5]). Building on the recommendations of clinical and research community members during the Enhancing the Discipline of Clinical and Translational Sciences meeting (May, 2005), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) identified research efforts to bridge science and practice as the primary objective of NIH's roadmap. The proposed research directly addresses this NIH Roadmap priority as well as these federal calls for action. Each year, about 6% of America's children andadolescents receive some form of mental health (MH) care, at an annual cost of more than 11 billion. In addition, each year NIMH and other foundations fund more than 300 million for youth MH research, much of it devoted to treatment studies. The findingsfrom the proposed research will advance our understanding of how to successfully integrate MH EBIs into everyday practice within the primary MH service setting for youth, i.e., schools. Increasing the likelihood that EBIs will be adopted, used as intended, and sustained in everyday practice in schools, in turn, will increase the likelihood that youth and society at large will benefit from evidence-based practices."

Past interventions to improve adherence have had mixed results, with the most success stemming from those that were very complex and costly. Convenient, cost effective tools to increase clinician/researcher awareness of adherence while creating minimal patient burden are needed. Self-monitoring (SM) is increasingly used across diverse medical fields as both a clinical tool and research method to gather critical adherence data from patients. SM presents myriad advantages over traditional data collection methods including lower recall bias, increased generalizability, and lower patient burden. However, traditional paper-and-pencil methods of SM are too complex and labor intensive for patients to complete easily, resulting in poor compliance and inaccurate, low quality data. In order to best sample patients' behaviors and experiences in real time and in natural environments, computerized SM technologies (C-SM) for mobile devices hold tremendous promise, with patients reporting them to be more convenient, less time consuming, easier to use, and more motivating to complete. Yet, despite the vast potential offered by C- SM, broad scale dissemination and use in medical treatment and research has not yet shown viability due to prohibitively high demands for time, finances, and trained technical staff to develop individualized software. Furthermore, currently available C-SM technologies are highly specialized for a specific purpose with little ability to adapt technology used for C-SM with one patient group to another. The goal of this Phase I project is to develop andtest a technology infrastructure to support creation and broad scale deployment of C-SM for mobile devices. The proposed Mobile Application System for Health Monitoring (MAS-HM) would allow clinicians and medical researchers to: (a) create C-SM assessments, protocols, and prompts specifically for deployment to mobile devices (smartphone app, mobile web, or SMS text messaging), (b) monitor and track patients' SM progress, and (c) conduct synchronous data analysis to determine patient adherence level. Most importantly, the MAS-HM will utilize a ubiquitous technology platform that would remove key barriers to adopting C-SM methods and make mobile deployment of C-SM accessible for any medical intervention or research study. This Phase I proposal will accomplishthree specific aims: 1) Design the MAS-HM prototype; 2) Conduct feasibility groups with clinicians, medical researchers, and adolescents and young adults with chronic illness; and 3) Establish final prototype specifications using data compiled and analyzed from the feasibility groups. These specifications will be used to guide Phase II development prior to efficacy testing. The final MAS-HM product will leverage the ubiquity of mobile devices combined with their powerful networking and computational capabilities to significantly increase C-SM accuracy, timeliness, and ease of use. Greater access to and use of C-SM should translate into improved patient adherence and treatment effectiveness.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical non-adherence has been identified as a major public health problem that imposes a considerable financial burden upon modern health care systems [1-5]. Because of the complexities in measuring adherence, no estimate can be generalized, but poor adherence is to be expected in 30-50% of all patients, irrespective of disease, prognosis, or setting [2, 3, 6-8]. This burden has been estimated to cost 100 billion each year in the US [4], including 10% of hospital admissions [2, 3]. Adherence is also critical to the integrity of clinical research findings in order to preserve sufficient statistical power for analysis and to minimize the potential for obscured findings. Indeed, as clinician's increasingly rely on treatment protocols that are based on clinical trial evidence, it is critical toaddress adherence in the realm of research as well [9-14]. The proposed MAS-HM would remove barriers to adherence monitoring and provide significant advantages in convenience, cost effectiveness, and utility over existing clinical tools and research instruments."

Currently, nearly 40 percent of the Latino population is under the age of 20 (Ramirez and de la Cruz, 2003). Concomitant with this population growth is a pressing need to address significant social-emotional, behavioral, and academic disparities between Latino children and non-Latino white children (Farkas, 2003; USDHHS, 2001; Wright and Troop, 2005). Perceptions of a closed school community have been found to create or exacerbate problems with academic performance, educational aspirations, and behavioral-emotional functioning for Latino youth (Romero and Roberts, 2003; Szalacha et al., 2003; Vega et al., 1995). Intervention and prevention research suggests social acceptance of Latino students and integration into the school community are key environmental factors that promote positive functioning (Ibaqez et al., 2004; Suarez-Orozco and Suarez-Orozco, 1995; Valencia, 2002). The goal of this Phase II SBIR project is to continue the research and development of a school-based cultural heritage curriculum for upper elementary school students, Cultural Heritage Stories for Kids: Latino Series (hereafter CHSK:LS), to create the full product, including a story library of traditional and acculturation stories from different Latino cultures (e.g., Mexican American, Puerto Rican, Cuban), presented by professional Latino storytellers in both English and Spanish. CHSK:LS will provide school professionals with an innovative effective universal classroom intervention specifically designed to celebrate Latino cultural heritage, promote understanding of cultural diversity in the classroom, and engender a more integrated, accepting classroom environment. During Phase I, the CHSK:LS prototype materials were evaluated very positively by school professionals as well as parents and children. However, specific suggestions for Phase II development were noted. The first aim of Phase II will be to revise and extend based on the feedback attained during Phase I, Phase II stakeholder input, and expert advice of Advisory Board members. Once the CHSK:LS product is completed, the second aim of Phase II will be to conduct a rigorous test of the product efficacy via a randomized treatment-control experimental design assessing change as a function of participation in CHSK-LS for two sets of outcomes: (a) individual student-level social, behavioral, emotional, and academic functioning at school and (b) overall classroom climate. The third aim will be to the finalize all product materials based on Phase II findings and evaluations from product testing, package all components for commercialization, and ready the product for broad-scale dissemination through our commercialization partner. The proposed Phase II SBIR project will result in a highly innovative intervention package with substantial competitive advantages, providing schools with a much needed evidence-based intervention package to promote multicultural awareness and integration, and address behavioral health disparities for Latino students. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the Latino population totals over 46 million people, with projections indicating Latino individuals will account for nearly 1 in 3 U.S. residents by the year 2050 (USCB, 2008). Currently, nearly 40 percent of the Latino population is under the age of 20 (Ramirez and de la Cruz, 2003). From 1993 to 2003, the number of minority school enrollments increased from 34 to 41 percent, with Latino students accounting for the majority of that increase (6 percentage points; NCES, KewalRamani et al., 2007). Compared to non-Latino white children, Latino children are at profoundly greater risk for a wide variety of academic problems (Farkas, 2003; USDHHS, 2001; Wright and Troop, 2005), including lower school engagement, grades, and test scores (NCES, KewalRamani et al., 2007; NCES Status and Trends in Edu of Hisp, 2003). In addition, perceived discrimination and insecurity about ethnic identity has been linked to externalizing behavior problems, increased depressive symptoms, and diminished self-esteem (Umaqa-Taylor and Updegraff, 2007, Vega et al., 1995). Culturally specific factors, such as a cultural mismatch between the home and school community, low school integration, and negative stereotyping, have been shown to contribute to decreased school performance (Kroth, 2009; USDEd, 2000; Viadero, 2000). Further, an increasingly frustrating school environment for Latino students can foster high levels of absenteeism and school dropout rates. Nearly 50 percent of Latino students do not graduate from high school (Orfield et al., 2004). Dropping out of school, in turn, has serious consequences for Latino youth, placing them at risk for unemployment, reduced income, diminished health outcomes, use of public assistance, and increased likelihood for delinquent, criminal, and risk-taking behaviors (see Sweeten et al., 2009). Furthermore, the financial costs to society of school dropout are great. Approximately 600,000 youth drop out of high school each year in the Unites States (Muennig, 2000). It has been estimated that if those students had completed their high school diplomas instead, states could save more than 2.3 billion in public insurance utilization and student gains in lifetime earnings could be as much as 72 billion dollars (Muennig, 2000)."

NCRR's Strategic Priorities emphasize the need to expand the development of technologies to build up research capacity for basic, clinical, and translational research so findings can be more quickly and effectively translated into clinical practice. This SBIR project will directly address these research priorities by developing and testing an innovative web-based technology, Research Implementation and Management System (RIMS), specifically designed to advance and support the research efforts of clinical, social, and behavioral (CSB) scientists. There is a critical need to develop well-tested, researcher-approved web-based tools that will support scientists across a broad range of fields. RIMS will offer an integrated suite of tools for the many tasks required to conduct research with human participants, including recruitment, screening and randomization, human participant protections, measure construction, data collection and tracking, and database management. Phase I of this project will accomplish three specific aims: (1) conduct stakeholder workgroups with CSB researchers (PIs, projects coordinators, and research assistants) to establish the features and functions to be included in RIMS; (2) create the RIMS prototype based on stakeholder recommendations and input from the Advisory Board members, and (3) field-test the prototype through a second set of researchers, gathering quantitative and qualitative data assessing the value, innovation, feasibility, usability, and quality of the proposed product. Using Phase I as a foundation, Phase II will involve full development and testing of RIMS. Phase II field testing will be conducted with research teams across a broad range of fields to ensure the effectiveness and broad applicability of the RIMS product. Our market analysis revealed no software or web-based product offering a comprehensive research support package specifically designed to meet the needs of CSB researchers. Our work with scientists over the years underscores the large unmet demand for these tools and services. RIMS will provide a unique, much needed resource within a large market where no comparable web-based product exists.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: NIH's mission to improve health outcomes for all people emphasizes the need to accelerate and strengthen clinical and translational research. Technology can play a vital role in achieving this goal through web-based tools for researchers that allow them to conduct, disseminate, and translate their research more efficiently and with higher quality. Clinical, behavioral, and social researchers play a critical role in understanding and preventing public health problems, maintaining good health, and treating disease. The treatment and prevention of diabetes, obesity, and drug abuse, violence, and myriad other public health concerns depend on good research that is conducted cost-effectively and translated efficiently. The proposed Research Implementation Management System (RIMS) will offer a suite of on-line research tools to streamline the various activities needed to conduct clinical, social, and behavioral research with human participants, including recruitment, screening and randomization, human participant protections, measure construction, data collection, and database management. This product will be developed and tested in response to the needs of researchers to significantly advance their productivity, and the quality and efficiency of their studies. The underlying web-based technology infrastructure of RIMS will be broadly applicable, providing customizable tools that can be easily integrated into a research protocol. RIMS will bridge geographic barriers by giving researchers with fewer institutional supports for research equal access to affordable, flexible technology. In effect, this SBIR will be able to support clinical, social, and behavioral research across multiple NIH Institutes, with particular relevance for the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institute on Aging (NIA), and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). Bringing the RIMS product to market would broadly support NIH's mission to improve public health outcomes through strengthening capacity for clinical and translational science."

This is of critical concern, particularly given the recent accountability movement and federal financial incentives for use of programs supported by empirical evidence. Even in those instances in whichinterventionsthathaveproveneffectiveunderstrictresearchconditionsaredeliveredinthe realworld, they often fail to achieve their intended outcomes. One explanation for this discrepancy is that the EBIs are not implemented with the same level of fidelity to the treatment model as in the research setting (Curtis, Ronan, and Borduin, 2004). A growing body of literature indicates the quality of implementation is directly related to the likelihood that an EBI will be adopted and sustained within the community MH setting as well as the strength of its treatment effects. Quality implementation in this instance refers to the degree to which an intervention is delivered as intended, i.e., with fidelity to the treatment model. Three key areas have been found to directly impact the quality of EBI implementation: (1) training support (including on-going implementation assistance); (2) structured, user-friendly resource materials; and (3) accountability tools for monitoring, tracking, and reporting fidelity to core intervention features. The goal of the proposed SBIR project is to develop and test a web-based dissemination toolbox (WDT) that supports quality implementation of community-based mental health EBIs for youth. The proposed WDT will build on recommendations from the research literature to create a suite of tools and services that can be applied in support of disseminating the majority of community-based EBIs on a broad scale. Currently, no comparable product exists for community-based interventions. The proposed WDT will leverage3-C ISD's technological expertise and experience to create a flexible, scalable web tool that will decrease costs (time, financial, personnel) to both community MH settings and intervention developers, enhance the integrity with which EBIs are implemented in community MH settings, and increase dissemination of EBIs into real world everyday practice. The final product will be highly innovative, providing the unique ability to apply the WDT to a wide array of EBIs, which will ensure broad-based marketability. Three specific aims will be accomplished through Phase I of this project: (1) the prototype of the WDT will be created with input from the project Advisory Board; (2) the prototype will be evaluated by stakeholder groups to test the feasibility, usability, and value of the proposed WDT; and (3) a full development plan for Phase II will be generated based on Phase I findings and recommendations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As the mental health research-practice a phas become increasingly evident, numerous federal reports have called for action to better connect research findings to clinical practice [e.g., The President's New Freedom Commission Report(2003);Reports of the Surgeon General on Mental Health (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1999), Youth Violence (HHS, 2001a), and Culture, Race, and Ethnicity (HHS, 2001b); and the National Children's Call to Action (HHS,2000)]. Building on the recommendations of clinical and research community members during the Enhancing the Discipline of Clinical and Translational Sciences meeting (May, 2005), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) identified research efforts to bridge science and practice as a primary objective of NIH's Roadmap. The proposed research directly addresses NIH's Roadmap priorities as well as these federal calls for action. Each year, about 6 percent of America's children and adolescents receive some form of MH care, at an annual cost of more than 11 billion. In addition, each year NIMH and other foundations fund more than 300 million for youth MH research, much of it devoted to treatment studies. The findings from the proposed research will advance our understanding of how to successfully integrate EBIs into everyday practice within community MH service settings for youth. Increasing the likelihood that EBIs will be adopted, used as intended, and sustained in everyday practice, in turn, increases the likelihood that youth and society at large will benefit from evidence-based practices."

These children face serious academic and behavioral health disparities compared with their White counterparts (Breland-Noble, 2004; USDHHS, 2001). Culturally-relevant programs are needed to decrease behavioral health disparities among Black youth (Carter, 1996; Tillman and Shirley, 2002). Specifically, research suggests that acceptance of Black students and integration into the school community are key environmental factors that promote positive functioning across domains (e.g., Grieg 2003; Carter et al., 1997; Smith et al., 1999). Interventions that celebrate Black cultural heritage, promote acceptance of diversity, and educate students about similarities among cultures can effectively engender an integrated, accepting school environment, thereby fostering behavioral health benefits (Coard, Wallace, Stevenson, and Miller, 2004; Roscigno, 1998). The proposed innovative product, LifeStories for Kids: Black Cultural Heritage Series (LS-BCH), is a school- based curriculum for upper elementary children focusing on Black heritage and culture featuring professional Black storytellers. The complete story library will include both traditional (e.g., stories from the Underground Railroad) and experiential (e.g., acculturation) stories in order to increase self-esteem and school engagement among Black students, as well as promote an integrative, positive overall school climate. Phase I of this project will address two specific aims: (1) Development of a curriculum prototype i.e., Professional Manual (administrative guidelines, lesson scripts, activities), DVD featuring a Black professional storyteller, parent handouts, and web resources, and (2) Feasibility testing of the prototype product (i.e., detailed product evaluation by school professionals involved in curriculum adoption and focus groups with students in grades 3-5 and their parents). During Phase II, the prototype will be revised and expanded based on Phase I findings to include four additional Black storytellers and all accompanying lesson scripts and materials. A randomized treatment-control research study examining changes in children's academic, social-emotional, and behavioral functioning at school, as well as the overall school climate, will also be completed in Phase II. The efforts of the Phase I and Phase II projects will result in an evidence-based, universal, cultural heritage school-based curriculum for children in grades 3-5, LifeStories for Kids: Black Cultural Heritage Series (LS-BCH), which uses the engaging and powerful educational format of storytelling to share stories of Black cultural heritage that, along with accompanying lessons and materials, promote cultural acceptance and integration of Black students into the school community.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Data consistently point to an achievement gap between Blacks and Whites across the nation. Culturally- relevant curricula that speak to key environmental and social factors associated with acceptance and integration into the school community are needed in order to effectively address the disparities faced by Black youth. There is a pressing need for culturally-relevant programs that foster cultural acceptance and integration into the school community. LS-BCH addresses this need and is consistent with Healthy People 2010: Understanding and Improving Health, which emphasizes a design, implementation, and evaluation process that accounts for special issues for select population groups (ethnic and racial) (USDHHS, 2000). LS-BCH represents a culturally relevant product to address increasing demographic diversity and the need for culturally competent interventions to help eliminate ethnic and racial behavioral health disparities. The proposed research is also consistent with recommendations by the Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health (USDHHS, 2001). Specifically, the report recommends tailoring services to meet the needs of all Americans,including racial and ethnic minorities . Universal programs (i.e., applied equally with all children in a school) are particularly needed because they can be applied to every classroom within schools and can affect change at both the individual and systems levels (more cost-effective to implement). Findings from this research will advance our understanding of how to successfully address the behavioral health disparities of Black youth through school-based curricula."

When youth experience difficulties in the peer system, a wide array of negative behaviors, emotional difficulties, negative attitudes, and academic problems are likely to develop. However, prevention and treatment research indicates this cycle can be ameliorated, if not broken, with the application of targeted, structured, cognitive-behavioral skills training interventions. Further, the efficacy of interventions is enhanced when training extends to multiple settings (e.g., intervention setting and home) and practice outside of the treatment sessions (e.g., homework) is included. Therefore, focusing exclusively on the youth is not as effective as multi-component intervention efforts that target both the youth and the home environment. The goal of this SBIR project is to develop a parent-based intervention product that parallels an existing evidenced based adolescent-focused intervention product, i.e., Social Skills GRoup INtervention-Adolescent (SSGRIN-A). The complete Parent Guide to SSGRIN-A (SSGRIN-A PG) will consist of 10 sessions addressing specific social skill sets, including self-esteem building, impulse control, and communication. Skill training will be grounded in cognitive-behavioral and social learning principles incorporating the five Methods of Change (MOC). In particular, skill training will focus on the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional shifts that occur in early-to-middle adolescents necessitating transformations in the dynamics of both adult and peer interactions and requiring reorganization of family and peer relationships. For the Phase I prototype, the professional manual and all needed materials for Sessions 1-5 will be developed, including session scripts, parent handouts, interactive web-based resources and an overview video. Once the SSGRIN-A PG prototype is complete, an initial test of feasibility within two targeted markets [i.e., school- and community- based mental health professionals; n=30 each] and with targeted end users (i.e., parents; n=60) will be conducted. Phase I findings will provide the foundation for the development and testing of the complete SSGRIN-A PG intervention program for parents during Phase II. Once SSGRIN-A PG has been finalized, a scientific evaluation of the efficacy of the product will be conducted examining changes in youth's social, behavioral, and emotional functioning and in parent's support for social skill development and sense of competence. Development of psychiatric disorders due to socio-emotional deficits is a public health concern with annual US economic, indirect cost of mental illnesses estimated at 79 billion. Development and implementation of efficacious interventions such as SSGRIN-A PG can reduce these costs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Peer problems have been repeatedly related to a myriad of concurrent adjustment problems (e.g., disruptiveness, loneliness, academic failure) and later negative outcomes (e.g., suicide, dropping out of school, criminality, drug use, and mental health problems), each of which exact a significant toll both on individuals and society. Costs to society for adjudication, incarceration, social agency and treatment programs, and damage/loss of property due to the actions of aggressive and antisocial youth are exorbitant, exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars per year. SSGRIN-A PG will provide schools and mental health settings with an effective tool to prevent an increasingly negative path towards escalating antisocial behavior and negative outcomes. Providing parents with an effective way to help their teens build social skills and improve peer relations, as well as their ability to cope with social stressors, will improve youths' quality of life and help offset the development of more serious maladjustment."

Decades of research indicate that peer rejection, isolation, and victimization negatively
impact adjustment and place children at increased risk for a myriad of later negative outcomes. Prevention and treatment research supports the use of social skills group therapy for improving children's peer relations, social behavior, and emotional adjust
ment. However, focusing exclusively on the child is not as effective as multi-component intervention efforts that extend beyond the group setting. This Competing Renewal project will continue the research and development of a parent-focused intervention, P
arent Guide to SSGRIN, which parallels an established child-focused intervention [Social Skills Group Intervention (S.S. GRIN); for children ages 5-12years], in order to teach and reinforce the same social skills and concepts within the home environment. P
hase II objectives of creating the complete Parent Guide intervention product and conducting pilot efficacy research were successfully accomplished. However, the limited scope of the Phase II research project leaves critical questions unanswered regarding
the treatment's effectiveness, particularly its relative impact above and beyond the SSGRIN intervention alone. As 3-C ISD has moved the Parent Guide product into Phase III commercialization, it has become increasingly evident that further RandD is critica
l to commercializing this product. Therefore, a primary goal of this Competing Renewal is to conduct a rigorous, large-scale, longitudinal research project that is adequately powered to address questions of relative impact, longer-term treatment benefits,
and differential treatment effects across settings and populations. Another lesson learned during Phase II and subsequent commercialization efforts is that the Parent Guide's current design is impractical for the school setting. Though schools often strugg
le with how to increase parent involvement in school-based programs, school officials report that it is infeasible for them to conduct the full series of in-person parent training groups as the Parent Guide's current curriculum demands. As a result, the co
mmercial potential for the product is greatly restricted. Therefore, a second goal of this Competing Renewal is to incorporate Phase II findings, commercialization feedback, and stakeholder input into the creation of a Home-study version of the Parent Guid
e, which would utilize 3-C's innovative web- and video- based technology to bridge training into the home environment. Once developed, the Home-study version of the Parent Guide will be included as a separate treatment condition within the effectiveness tr
ial and will also be evaluated for feasibility specifically within the school setting. The proposed Competing Renewal project will support further product development so that the Parent Guide can be successfully extended into the school setting, a primary
mental health service sector for children, and will also ensure extensive, large-scale testing of this product to address key research questions that are imperative for achieving both scientific and commercial goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Problematic pe
er relations, particularly when chronic, can have a tremendous impact on children's mental health as well as their behavioral and emotional functioning. Without intervention, social and behavioral problems tend to persist and escalate over time which, in t
urn, has a tremendous impact on the development of psychopathology. Ultimately, socio-emotional deficits and the consequent emergence of a myriad of negative outcomes, including heightened risk for psychiatric disorders and use of mental health services ha
ve a negative impact not only on the individual, but also on the family and society as a whole, and are considered a serious public health issue. Mental illne"

A vast health disparity exists in which Black youth are signif
icantly more likely to both be identified as exhibiting antisocial behavior and to be the victim of others' antisocial acts. For example, victimization rates for violent crimes are greater than 750% higher for Black adolescents compared to White adolescent
s (Centers for Disease Control, 2004; Rachuba, Stanton, and Howard, 1995). The lack of culturally sensitive, evidence-based interventions for Black youth exacerbates the problem and hinders access to mental health services among Blacks (Mandersheid and Son
nenschen, 1996). The goal of this Phase II project is to continue the research and development (RandD) of a child small group social-behavioral intervention curriculum, Celebrating the Strengths of Black Youth (CSBY), specifically designed to be culturally
 relevant and effective for Black youth. This Phase II project will build on Phase I findings to offer an innovative, much needed resource for preventing and decreasing existing behavioral health disparities in Black children (ages six to eight years old).
 CSBY will offer multi-media resources, including videos and interactive computer resources, and a skill-based curriculum specifically aimed at enhancing social and behavioral competencies. CSBY not only offers mental health (MH) professionals a significan
t advancement over what is currently available for use with Black youth, but it also provides a unique means of bridging intervention settings with home efforts to promote cross-environment generalization in social and behavioral functioning. During Phase
II, the complete CSBY product will be developed, revised, and extended through a series of Alpha and Beta tests. During the course of product development, the 3-C development team will draw on the Advisory Council forthis project, as well as relevant3-C Sc
ientific Advisory Board members to review product materials, provide feedback, and aid development through resources and contacts, as needed. The planned iterative development and feedback by diverse stakeholders will produce a product that will be widely
applicable, usable, and acceptable, thereby increasing its commercial potential. Once completed, the CSBY Beta prototype will be scientifically evaluated. In addition to program engagement and product evaluation measures, the efficacy of CSBY for enhancing
 children's social and behavioral functioning will be empirically tested through randomized trials within both school- and community-based settings. It is expected that Black youth participating in CSBY will be more engaged in treatment and show greater im
provement on social- behavioral indices compared to Black youth participating in an established generally-applicable social skills program (i.e., S.S.GRIN; DeRosier, 2006). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antisocial behavior and violence among youth has become a
national health crisis for which Black youth are disproportionately at risk (Cicchetti and Lynch, 1993; Prothrow-Stith and Spivak,1992). However, existing research on the effectiveness of specific strategies to reduce and prevent youth violence remains cha
llenged by increasing diversity and the need to provide services that are both developmentally and culturally appropriate. The proposed product is consistent with what has been identified by several legislative mandates as necessary in addressing the chall
enges of providing health care to differing ethnicities and fostering the development of cultural competence in service providers. The proposed product is also consistent with priorities identified by NICHD to help reduce or eliminate health disparities am

The effectiveness of school-based MH programs has been repeatedly demonstrated for a wide array of child behavioral and emotional disorders, includin

 as the recent accountability movement in education and federal financial incentives for use of programs supported by empirical evidence, empirically-based interventions (EBIs) are rarely used in everyday practice by schools. In addition, school-based inte

As children enter preschool and begin to navigate social situations outsi
de the home, problem behaviors interfere with social development, placing children at risk for problematic peer relations and delayed social skills. Without intervention, social and behavioral problems tend to persist and even escalate over time and, in tu
rn, have a tremendous impact on the development of child psychopathology. Decades of research indicate social and behavioral deficits negatively affect adjustment and place children at increased risk for a myriad of later negative outcomes including depres
sion, substance abuse, and delinquency (see Parker, Rubin, Price and DeRosier, 1995, for review). In contrast, positive social relationships serve as a protective factor promoting more positive developmental outcomes. Prevention and treatment research supp
orts the use of social skills training (SST) for improving children's peer relations, social behavior, and emotional adjustment (see Greenberg, Domitrovich, and Bumbarger, 2001, for review). In addition, intervening with problematic social behaviors before
 they become chronic and intractable has been repeatedly heralded as a key to preventing the development of more serious maladjustment (Greenberg, et al.; Parker et al.). Early intervention is critical in the prevention of severe social skill deficits and
entrenched negative peer interaction patterns (Coie, 1990). The goal of this Phase II project is therefore to continue the research and development of a version of an existing evidence-based small group SST program in order to make it applicable for younge
r children. This project will adapt 3-C ISD's SST program for 6-12 year old children, SSGRIN (Social Skills Group Intervention), to create a new intervention for young children (ages 4-6 years) titled SSGRIN-EC (SSGRIN for Early Childhood). SSGRIN-EC wil
l build on SSGRIN's foundation, as well as Phase I findings, to offer a unique early intervention resource that represents a significant advancement over what is currently available for SST with young children. SSGRIN-EC will provide mental health professi
onals with an innovative intervention program to enhance the emotional competencies and social relations of young children. SSGRIN-EC will offer multi-media resources, including video and interactive web resources, and a skill based curriculum specifically
 aimed at enhancing social skills competencies. It also provides a unique means of bridging intervention settings with home efforts to promote social and emotional functioning. The Phase I results provide substantial support for continued development, as w
ell as essential constructive feedback to inform the direction of that development. The proposed Phase II project will utilize the Phase I findings to revise, modify, and extend the SSGRIN-EC components in order to maximize quality and effectiveness. Once
finalized, a scientific evaluation of the efficacy of the intervention for mastery of social skills concepts and positive changes in social, emotional, and behavioral functioning will be conducted. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Problematic peer relations, particularl

S.S.GRIN-HFA provides mental health professionals with a unique multi-modal, multicomponent intervention program to enhance the social competencies and relations of children ages eight through twelve with HFX-ASD. S.S.GRIN-HFA integrates a structured skill-based curriculum with video, graphic materials (workbooks, social stories), and interactive web-based tools that not only target specific skill sets, but also bridge the intervention setting with home efforts to promote social functioning. During Phase II, the training program will be revised and refined based on Phase I results, feedback from the Phase II Advisory Committee, and feedback obtained from school-and community based professionals serving children with HFX-ASD. Once these program modifications are completed, an efficacy test and product evaluation will be conducted with children ages 8-12 with HFX-ASD. When final revisions and modifications to all product materials for the targeted age group are complete, the feasibility of further modifications to program materials (as well as use of existing program materials) for older and younger children with HFX-ASD will be investigated. Phase II findings will be shared with professionals through publications and presentations in order to advance the scientific knowledge base regarding effective interventions for children with HFX-ASD as well as to support Phase III commercialization efforts."

Without intervention, social-behavioral problems tend to persist and escalate over time which, in turn, has a tremendous impact on mental health. Social skills training (SST) is supported as an efficacious method for significantly improving children's peer relations, social behavior, and emotional adjustment and reducing risk of developmental psychopathology. Further, the efficacy of SST interventions is enhanced when training extends outside a treatment setting with practice opportunities. The goal of this one-year SBIR Phase I project is to extend an existing evidence-based small group SST program for children (SSGRIN; Social Skills Group Intervention) into the home environment through a computer-based interactive social training system (ISTS). The proposed ISTS will offer tailored interactive social problem-solving exercises that parallel SSGRIN's in-person intervention. A unique multi- disciplinary collaboration between computer science and psychology will guide development. For the Phase I prototype, the software user-interface, including graphic design, as well as modes of user interaction, story plot and sequence, and hierarchy of causal relations will be developed. Development will build on 3-C's existing work on pedagogical agents in social stories and animation for SST. Via the ISTS, children will actively solve plot-based social problems by interacting with pedagogical agents, purposefully using SSGRIN skills and concepts to navigate the story events. The interactivity of the proposed ISTS will be a significant technological advancement over current SST software enabling story events to be scaffolded based on child's actions and goals. In addition, the proposed ISTS will have a reporting feature built into the software to provide intervention providers with feedback regarding children's interactions with the ISTS to inform their in-person SST efforts. Once the software prototype is created, an initial test of feasibility will be conducted within two target market segments (school- and community-based child mental health professionals; n=30 each) and with targeted end users (children ages 8-12 years and parents; n=30 each) to determine the usability, feasibility, and value of the proposed product. Phase I findings will provide the foundation for the development and testing of the complete SSGRIN-ISTS product during Phase II. Once the ISTS is finalized, a scientific evaluation will be conducted in Phase II to examine whether inclusion of the ISTS results in enhanced treatment benefits for children's social skills, behavior, and mental health, greater generalization of skill acquisition, and higher engagement in treatment compared with SSGRIN alone. The long-term objective of this product is to decrease the development of psychiatric disorders due to socio-emotional deficits. This project addresses the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2003) calls for early treatment of children who experience mental health to offset potential co-occurring disorders, school failure, and other problems. Problematic peer relations, particularly when chronic, can have a tremendous impact on children's mental health as well as their academic, behavioral, and emotional functioning. Without intervention, social and behavioral problems tend to persist and escalate over time which, in turn, has a tremendous impact on the development of psychopathology. Development of psychiatric disorders due to socio-emotional deficits is a public health concern with annual US economic, indirect cost of mental illnesses estimated at $79 billion. Cost-effectiveness analyses of social skills training programs with even modest effect sizes estimated a monetary savings of more than $95,000 per participant and more than $8 return on every dollar invested. The President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2003) specifically calls for the identification and early treatment of children who experience mental health needs in order to prevent the potential onset of co-occurring disorders and break a cycle that otherwise can lead to school failure and other problems."

The goal of this SBIR project is to create and test a preschool version of an existing evidence-based small group social skills training program (SSGRIN; Social Skills Group Intervention) in order to make it applicable for younger children. The complete SSGRIN-P intervention program will consist of 10 sessions addressing specific social skill sets (i.e., Getting Acquainted, Consequences, Feelings, Communication, Empathy, Friendship, Cooperation, Problem Solving, Initiation, Review). For the Phase I prototype, the session scripts for the first five sessions will be developed, as well as the Professional Manual. All needed materials for Session 1-5 activities (e.g., puppets, music samples) will also be developed for the prototype. The multi-media components accompanying the first five sessions will be developed, including five in-session video segments and interactive web-based resources for children, parents, and professionals. The prototype interactive web-based resources will include four interactive games and activities for children to practice the skills taught in Sessions 2-5, as well as website links and resource lists of related books and other media for parents and professionals. Parent handouts will also be developed describing supplemental activities to implement at home to accompany each session.

The long-term objective of this product is to decrease the development of psychiatric disorders due to socio- emotional deficits. Therefore, this project directly addresses the research interest of the Division of Pediatric Translational Research and Treatment Development to support programs of research and research training with the ultimate goal of preventing and curing childhood psychopathology. National survey data suggest the prevalence of problem behaviors in young children is between 10-25% (Webster- Stratton & Hammond, 1997).

Development of psychiatric disorders due to socio-emotional deficits is a public health concern with annual US economic, indirect cost of mental illnesses estimated at $79 billion. Development and implementation of efficacious interventions such as SSGRIN-P can reduce these costs."

A vast health disparity exists where African American youth are significantly more likely to both exhibit antisocial behavior and to be the victim of others' antisocial acts. For example, victimization rates for violent crimes are greater than 750% higher for AfricanAmerican adolescents compared to white adolescents (Centers for Disease Control, 2004; Rachuba, Stanton, & Howard, 1995). To further exacerbate this health disparity, there is a tremendous lack of culturally sensitive, evidence-based interventions to combat the specific risk factors that foster antisocial behavior for African American youth. The limited availability of culturally relevant behavioral interventions for ethnic minority groups serves to create a barrier to accessing and utilizing mental health services by African Americans of all ages (Mandersheid & Sonnenschen, 1996). For example, African Americans under-consume community mental health services of all kinds, enter mental health treatment services at a later stage in the course of illness, and prematurely discontinue services at a significantly higher rate compared to white populations. To effectively combat the development of antisocial behavior among youth, cultural factors must be strategically and purposefully incorporated into program designs (Hill, Soriano, Chen, & LaFromboise, 1994). The goal of this project is to develop and test a child intervention curriculum specifically designed to be culturally relevant and effective for African American youth. This new intervention, entitled Black Parenting Strengths & Strategies-Child (BPSS-C), will build on an existing culturally modified parenting intervention curriculum, Black ParentingStrengths & Strategies (BPSS; Coard, 2003). The end product will represent an innovative, much needed resource for preventing and decreasing existing behavioral health disparities inAfrican American children (ages five to eight years-old)."

A history of aggressive behavior with peers is associated with a myriad of later negative outcomes, including delinquency and criminality. Intervention research supports the use of social skills training for decreasing aggression and antisocial behavior problems in aggressive youth as well as for improving their peer relations and social behavior. The primary aim of this project is to develop a new social skills intervention, entitled Project Forward (PF), for use with Middle and High school students. PF will build on an established group social skills intervention, S.S.GRIN (Social Skills GRoup INtervention) that has been particularly successful working with aggressive elementary students. PF will not only extend S.S.GRIN to older students, but also incorporate innovative treatment strategies so that PF will offer professionals a significant advancement over what is currently available for use with this population. The first task of Phase I will be to develop a prototype of the Project Forward (PF) intervention. PF will build on S.S.GRIN and extend skill training for decreasing antisocial and impulsive behavior and more directly address social triggers for aggression, such as bullying. Innovative treatment strategies (video segments and Internet-based homework) will also be integrated into the curriculum. Separate developmental versions will be created for Middle and High school, each including a Facilitator's Manual, session scripts, and youth and parent handouts. The second task of Phase I will be to conduct a test of PF's feasibility within two primary targeted markets (school counselors and community agency professionals). Based on Phase I findings, Phase II funding will be sought to revise and refine these products in order to maximize quality and create Spanish translations. A Phase II scientific evaluation of the use and efficacy of PF will also be conducted predicting changes in social and behavioral functioning. This project will establish PF as an efficacious competitor in the intervention marketplace."

relationships, decades of research have supported sociometric peer nomination
methods as a reliable and accurate means of identifying peer problems.
Problematic relationships with peers, particularly when chronic, can have a
tremendous impact on children's functioning and mental health. More accurate
identification of peer problems will enable schools to take proactive steps to
intervene before problems become chronic and intractable. Unfortunately, peer
nomination methods for data collection and data entry have traditionally been
cumbersome and labor and time intensive. Sociometric analyses have been
accomplished through highly complicated statistical programs. These
requirements create such barriers that only trained peer relationship
researchers have been able to utilize peer sociometric methodology. The goal of
this research is to create a product, SCAN, (training, software, and manuals)
that encompasses all the steps needed to complete a sociometric peer nomination
assessment through a simple, time-saving process. The use of this product will
be tested to examine its feasibility and utility as well as the technological
aspects of the software. Improvements to the product can then be made prior to
broad-scale marketing and distribution. This project will enable professionals
working with children around the country to access this valuable assessment
tool.

 particularly when chronic, can have a tremendous impact on children's
 functioning and mental health. Prevention and treatment research supports the
 use of social skills group therapy for improving children's peer relationships,
 social behavior, and emotional adjustment. However, focusing exclusively on the
 child is not as effective as multi-component interventions targeting both the
 child and home environment. Independently, parent training promotes positive
 role models and support for social goals at home. The goal of this research is
 to develop and test a parent-based intervention product, the Parent Guide to
 S.S. GRIN (including professional manual, parent handouts, audio tapes, and
 overview video), to parallel an established social skills group intervention
 for children. The feasibility and utility of the Parent Guide will be tested
 within a targeted market (school counselors, n=23) and with end users (parents,
 n=90). Revisions will be made based on findings and funding will be sought to
 scientifically evaluate the efficacy of the combined package (parent and child
 products) versus either intervention alone. Broad-scale marketing and
 distribution will then be sought through a partnership with a publishing firm.
 This research will provide more effective and diverse intervention strategies
 to professionals working to build children's social relationships.
 PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:
 This research will support the creation and initial testing of the Parent Guide to S.S. GRIN
 to be marketed to school and mental health professionals working with children in public
 and private settings. These products will parallel an established social skills group,
 intervention protocol and will be marketed as a combined package as well as separately.
 Findings will demonstrate feasibility to continue R & D efforts, including a combined intervention
 evaluation during Phase II, and will be used to obtain investment capital to support further
 product development and marketing. Multiple commercial products will be developed,
 including the professional manual, parent handouts, audio tapes, videos, and Spanish
 translations of each."

MAXTHALÂ®-211 is a derivative of Ti2AlC where the chemistry is modified (proprietary) and fine alumina particles are dispersed at the grain boundaries to improve the high temperature strength and creep resistance. It can be easily formed into complex shapes either by conventional machining or by net-shape fabrication methods such as injection molding or slip casting followed by pressureless sintering. With a density of 4.0 g/cm3, MAXTHAL-211 is lighter than Titanium. It has an operating temperature of 1400 ÂºC in air due to the formation of protective Al2O3 layer. The material has outstanding thermal shock resistance and damage tolerance. MAXTHALÂ®-211 can operate at 1400ÂºC for more than 5,000 h. Preliminary results also show significant improvement in compressive strength at 1200ÂºC.

At least one in five cancer patients do not adhere to treatment regimen, with much higher disease-specific rates. This non-adherence, or deviation from the recommended and expected clinical path, can dramatically increase costs of care, hospitalizations, adverse outcomes and the chance ofpreventable death. What causes non-adherence to treatment regimens is currently not rigorously understood. Current adherence research methods largely rely on survey instruments that have limited scale and scope, provide lagging information that inhibits timely intervention, and offer little actionable information to help patients to adhere to their care regimens. With continuous changes in cancer treatment, newer proactive approaches and methods for surveillance of patient adherence and targeted interventions are needed. In this Phase 2 SBIR project we will examine the validity of a novel approach (based on the completed Phase-1 project) that uses a novel computational algorithm to glean fine- grained attributes of cancer patients from standard electronic medical records. Our preliminary work has shown that most electronic medical records contain free-form text describing patient health progress, sentiment, vitals, medical condition, side effects, and social history written by physicians, nurses, medical assistants, and other staff during every visit encounter. With the steady adoption of electronic medical records by clinicians across the US (currently 29% and rising at 12% per year), clinical notes found in electronic records offer a tantalizing source of insight into patient adherence and behavior. In this Phase-2 SBIR project we aim to commercialize a novel, scalable prototype that can glean a rich set of risk factors for patient non-adherence from 1.5 million patient encounter records, corresponding to 30,050 patients that span a 10 year time-horizon from a community cancer clinic. Our objectives are to estimate the risk of a patient's ability to adhere to a prescribed regimen and enable targeted and timely interventions by using computational analysis of unstructured and structured fields in standard clinical documentation. We also aim to monitor and measure important patient treatment and adherence metrics (e.g. as defined by the American Society of Clinical Oncology) that can play a significant role in tracking high-risk patients for improved patient treatment outcomes, adherence, quality and safety. Our approach represents a significant, actionable advance over the lagging indicators offered by survey-based methods prevalent in adherence research. Our proposed approach has deep implications for improved quality of care, proactive management of chronic diseases, retention of patients in clinical practice and clinical trials, patient safety, improved patient follow-up and risk assessment, drug and disease surveillance, enablement of new care models, targeted intervention, and improved outcomes by helping patients to better adhere to their regimens.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We aim to show the feasibility of a commercial early warning system that detects and estimates a cancer patient's risk of non-adherence to treatment regimens by analyzing unstructured text in standard medical records.

The ability to effectively exploit these datasets will be based on an analyst's abilities to understand important contextual factors of the operating environment and sift through massive datasets. Cognitively-based tools are needed to train analysts in optimally exploiting ISR datasets.  We will leverage innovative simulation interview and cognitive task analysis methodologies to identify the cognitive challenges associated with conducting effective analyses in complex, uncertain environments. An analyst-centric focus will drive the development of an adaptive desktop trainer to support imagery analysts in better managing their ambiguous and time-critical tasking that flows from irregular warfare.

Emerging technologies continue to provide analysts with expanded data resources with the expectation that both efficiency and quality of the resultant integrated products will improve. Unfortunately, even when the potential for overload is recognized, analyst-aiding technologies and measures of effectiveness typically ignore the cognitive demands they need to reflect. To address this issue, we will apply recent advances in macrocognitive theory to develop and conduct a multi-faceted analysis of the cognitive demands associated with the development of integrated intelligence products. We will employ a combination of recently developed envisioned world, simulation interview techniques along with novel, macrocognitive elicitation techniques to identify the cognitive demands associated with effective integration. We will also develop candidate effectiveness measures that truly reflect those demands. These findings will directly inform enhancements to existing technologies within multiple intelligence cells at the National Air and Space Intelligence Center as well as the development of novel proof-of-concept analyst-aiding technologies. These technologies will be vetted with the operational community at the end of Phase I, and then fully-developed in Phase II.

With broad WAMI coverage areas, analysts can now monitor individuals, groups, and vehicles across space and time, allowing them to more accurately and effectively develop networks and patterns, and provide critical, time-sensitive information to customers. But with these capabilities come significant cognitive challenges. We propose an inherently analyst-centric approach to studying both current and future cognitive demands associated with real- and near-real time Air Force WAMI analysis. To identify current cognitive demands, we will complement our ongoing Blue Devil analyst study with a cognitive protocol specifically targeting the WAMI analysis process. To study future cognitive demands, we will develop and execute a cognitively-based simulation interview protocol, leveraging a 5x5 mile, color WAMI dataset collected specifically for this effort. The simulation will include both existing Air Force analysis tools and novel ones used by our partner, PSS, in their analyses. The simulation will also represent additional likely future Air Force capabilities planned for the next iteration of Blue Devil, and will incorporate simulated customer interactions, and critical cognitive elements. Candidate measures of effectiveness and analyst-aiding technologies will be developed, based on both current and future demands. BENEFIT: This effort represents an unprecedented analysis of both current and envisioned cognitive demands associated with Air Force WAMI analysis. Among the many transition avenues are the 495th EIS (specifically, Blue Devil and Gorgon Stare programs), NGA and DARPA, the Department of Homeland Security, and law enforcement.

Analyst cognitive demands, requirements, and preferences have had little influence in the design of these tools. As a result, these so called""decision aids""can often inhibit the decision making process. In Phase II of this effort, we propose to continue our Phase I Cognitive Systems Engineering approach to develop an analyst-centric LADAR analysis support tool, leveraging the nascent Opticks LADAR add-on framework as a starting point. We will extend the cognitive task analysis and simulation interview protocols developed and executed in Phase 1 to fully describe and detail the decision points, cues and strategies, performance barriers, and current/future benefits associated with LADAR data analysis, leveraging a range of operational LADAR PED cell analysts and likely future NASIC users.  Our end product will promote efficient and effective analysis by: leveraging automation only where the analyst will need and accept it (e.g., improved line of sight analysis, automated colorization range enhancements, product support development); developing cognitively-based user interfaces; and implementing the Visual Checklist tool, which will describe the critical decision points in the analysis process. BENEFIT: Analyst-centric LADAR PED decision support tools will greatly enhance the ability of analysts to provide more effective and customized products to their customers. Military benefactors of such tools (and the research we will conduct to derive them) include operational PED cells in Afghanistan and elsewhere as well as NASIC analysts and the Air Force LADAR R & D community.

LADAR is an emerging sensor technology that provides a rich data source for human analysts in support of combat identification. However, the primary focus of prior research has been on developing LADAR as a technology without adequately considering how an analyst will exploit LADAR data. Additionally, providing 3D LADAR data to an analyst when they are already trying to manage ever-increasing amounts of data in multiple forms can promote data overload. Further, issues of trust in automation must be examined. We will leverage innovative research methodologies and cognitive task analyses to identify the cognitive demands and challenges of combat identification analysts and determine how 3D LADAR data can address these gaps. We will develop visualization concepts based on ecological interface design principles to support 3D data exploitation. This effort will utilize a decision-centered design approach to develop a truly collaborative system that will allow a human analyst and assisted target recognition systems to work together to exploit 3D LADAR data. These concepts will generalize to other domains where the exploitation of 3D data is critical including medical imagery, border surveillance, and airport screening. BENEFIT: Within the military, this research will have direct applicability to military intelligence and any analysts who are responsible for exploiting 3D LADAR data for combat identification. The proposed system will provide innovative visualization concepts that will allow analysts to interpret and act on 3D data. This ability has direct relevance to any government or private sector group that uses 3D data, including DHS (border surveillance and airport screening) and the medical community (diagnosis using 3D imaging)."

The model further incorporates several cultural and expertise-development frameworks. In Phase 2, this model will be applied across Army mission sets, modified, and validated. A blended approach will be taken to develop an assessment methodology that will include self-report measures, situational judgment tests, scenarios, and other metrics. The model and metrics will serve as the basis for the Cross-Cultural Assessment Tool (C-CAT), an online program that will assess an individual Soldierâs cross-cultural competence and provide customized, usable feedback.

These cognitive differences naturally result in expectancy violations and perceptual mismatches between people of different cultures. And while they are, by nature, difficult to observe, a cultureâs cognitive attributes significantly influence individual perceptions and overt behaviors. A training program that addresses general cross-cultural perspective taking skills needs to acknowledge these cognitive differences and make them a primary focus. We propose to use the Cultural Lens Model, an innovative cognitive model that integrates multiple theories on cultural differences, as a guiding framework for the proposed effort. The Cultural Lens Model offers a structure for understanding, explaining, and potentially predicting reasoning and decision-making behaviors of members of different cultures. Our resultant program will integrate required baseline knowledge within the context of skill-building, scenario-based exercises. It will provide trainees with a general mental model of how cultures differ in cognition, along with the ability to apply that model to themselves and others.

Thus, current microbial products have decreased effectiveness and reliability.3Bar Biologics is creating a disruptive new system to deliver beneficial microorganisms - a low cost, disposable bioreactor that protects the microorganisms until the farmer is ready to activate the product prior to application. On-site growth of the beneficial microorganisms short-cuts the conventional supply chain, resulting in fresher, more viable microorganisms delivered to the field. This bioreactor opens up the potential for farmers to apply more effective microorganism strains with SCN control capability.The work plan addresses three technical objectives to create a functional prototype for commercialization of strains with demonstrated activity on SCN, to i) maximize cellular yields in the device with a number of proven beneficial strains, ii) characterize stability and compatibility of new formulations, and iii) evaluate efficacy against SCN in the field.This project is directly aligned with USDA NIFA Challenge Area 1) Global Food Security, and Priority 8.2.4) to research biobased approaches for plant protection against abiotic and biotic stresses."

For instance, in the DPF, the device regeneration usually requires the monitoring and control of NOx to help reduce theregeneration cycle number and fuel consumption for a robust operation of the particulate filtration. While the SCR, as the most reliable and successful approach to remove NOx from diesel engineexhaust, requires an injection of NH3 in the form of urea to catalytically convert NOx into nontoxic N2 and water. However, the amount of injected NH3 needs be monitored on the basis of NOx composition (NO/NO2 ratio) presented in exhaust to prevent over injection and secondary pollution. Therefore, the on-board analysis of NOx has been an urgent issue needed to solve for emission control. At the University of Connecticut (UConn), nanostructure array (nanoarray) based bimodular sensors have been demonstrated to accurately differentiate NOx, SO2, and NH3 in ppm level with excellent sensitivity and selectivity. In this STTR phase I project, 3D Array Technology and UConn propose to develop an innovative bimodular sensing strategy to additively deploy and distribute locally on the commercial monolithic catalysts. By combining the resistor mode and impedance mode, the single sensor device can in-situ and real-time measure the gas composition in NOx mixture, as well as monitoring the PM and catalyst surface composition locally. Meanwhile, the simplicity and ease of fabrication/deployment of nanoarray-based sensors brought by the bimodular sensing strategy and in-situ growth on honeycomb monoliths could further optimize the cost and reliability. Specifically in this Phase I project, metal oxide nanoarray based bimodular sensors will be in-situ grown on commercial monolith substrates. The chemical and physical structure and properties of asâ prepared sensors will be well characterized and evaluated and their initial sensing performance towards mixture analysis will be evaluated and calibrated. In addition to the prototype bimodular NOx sensor tested in simulated gas atmosphere and low concentration detection window (<10 ppm), the reliability test will also be conducted in simulated exhaust atmosphere. The corresponding data processing on the basis of data-driven machine learning will be developed to analyze the gas mixture with heavy NOx loading and severe competitive adsorption to accommodate an enlarged detection window. A rich set of relevant parameters that can be interrogated in-situ and real-time include NOx composition, solid particulate size, mass and flow rate, substrate/catalyst surface composition, etc.. The distributed nanoarray architecture sensing technology proposed here is expected to enablea truly real-time and in situ on-board NOx/PM/catalyst diagnostics with good location precision, therefore help interpret and understand the dynamic aftertreatment device operation process. Further, remarkable spatial and temporal resolutions may be achieved as the built-in nanoarray sensors also directly contribute to the catalytic functions locally via real-time responses to the gaseous and solid species involved. Upon implementation, the proposed research will provide a unique in-situ and real-time interrogation approach for quantifying and understanding the commercial catalytic converters in operation. Further, the distributed monolithic sensor architectures will be the first of its kind as efficient sensing and control solutions with potentially remarkable spatial and temporal resolutions."

Space oxygen recovery technologies implemented include carbon formation reactors (CFR) and methane pyrolysis assembly (PPA) reactors. These technologies, however, almost universally result in the formation of particulate carbon, which could undermine the operation of the spacecraft and threaten crew safety. Therefore, this proposed project directly addresses the needs of the subtopic H3.01: Advancements in Carbon Dioxide Reduction: Critical Subsystems and Solid Carbon Repurposing. The overall objective of the proposed project is to develop a new class of catalytic nanoarray-based monolithic filters to achieve the efficient filtration of particulate carbon for space oxygen recovery by integrating catalytically active nanostructured arrays onto the porous metal particulate filters. During the filtration process, the conformal nanoarray forests can increase the filtration efficiency while maintaining a low-pressure drop. Meanwhile, the nanoarray-supported catalysts can motivate the carbon gasification reaction and achieve fast filter regeneration at low temperatures. The proposed particulate filter could also completely avoid crew exposure to the accumulated carbon particulates.

Efficient enabling and utilization of various functional devices represent an essential solution to pursue the environment and energy sustainability. Nanotechnology is emerging as an effective approach to improve the efficiency of functional devices for a variety of applications such as light harvesting, energy storage, gas sensing and emission control. Scalable integration of functional nanostructural entities such as nanoparticles, nanowires, nanosheets into applicable three-dimensional (3-D) platform holds the keys of industrial-relevant manufacture of these functional devices. Among all the integration approaches, the wet-chemical based integration is one of the top options due to its advantages in low-cost, flexibility in substrate geometry and composition, ease of operation, and high repeatability. The wet-chemical based processes usually require continuous heating to initiate the chemical reactions, which is regularly achieved by conventional resistive heating.However, such conventional heating method is plaqued by a poor heating efficiency. Moreover, the conventional heating is not suitable for those substrates with three-dimensional (3D) or complex geometry since it hardly provides sufficient heat transfer and mass transport within substrates, leading to poor uniformity of nanostructure deposition and low production rate. Thus, there is urgent demand to develop high-efficiency wet-chemical based integration strategy for nanostructured functional devices. In this project, we propose to develop a novel microwave-irradiation-intensified hydrothermal manufacturing process for scalable manufacture of nanostructured monolithic devices. A wide array of metal oxide nanostructured coatings will be in situ grown on various 3D substrates such as ceramic honeycombs. To improve the growth efficiency, production rate, and distribution uniformity of various nanostructures, microwave irradiation will be introduced to substitute conventional heating sources such as oven and water bath. Mechanical agitation will be used to induce continuous mass transport in substrates. The microwave-induced enhancement on growth efficiency will be investigated with respect to the resulting chemical and physical characteristics of prepared nanostructured devices. The synthesis and processing protocols will be optimized by studying a variety of parameters including microwave power output, pulse frequency and solution flow dynamics. Finally, the production rate of proposed integration strategy will be compared with the typical batch process being used in current industrial manufacturing of nanostructured devices. As a proof of concept, a couple of scale-up monolithic devices will be fabricated and validated as field-relevant catalytic reactors emission control and other environmental remediation."

Despite recent advances, prostate cancer mortality still remains high due to the emergence of therapy-resistant cancer cells that metastasize. This lack of effective therapies against metastatic cancer exists, at least in part, because of lack of drug screening platforms that address the unique nature of metastastatic prostate cancer cells and their microenvironment. Recently, our collaborators havefound that prostate cancer (PCa) cells act as molecular parasites as they metastasize to bone and harvest resources from the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche environment where they stay dormant and resistant to conventional anti-cancer drugs. If the dormant metastasized PCa cells that parasitize the HSC niche could be recreated in vitro, they would serve as ideal platforms to screen specifically for anti-metastatic PCa drugs. We have recently shown that 3D co-culture spheroids can mimic the PCa cell parasitized HSC niche thereby maintaining PCa cells in a physiological, more quiescent state. What is required to take advantage of the metastatic PCa microtissue engineering capability we have acquired for drug screening applications is to develop a high throughput format of these types of co-culture spheroids. Towards this end, this Phase I STTR proposal will: Aim 1: Validate a 384 array hanging drop plate system for preparation of the co-culture spheroids. This is a major focus of 3-D Biomatrix, LLC. We have already modified our published platform (Tung et al. 2011) to: enhance droplet stability, facilitate pipette tip insertin, mitigate evaporation, and preserve sterility during optical analysis (Figure 1A). We will perform high throughput performance validations for fluorescence, transmitted light, and bioluminescence assays (Z'- factor), and further refine the design as necessary. Aim 2: Create arrays of microengineered 3D tissues of bone metastasized PCa in the quiescent state. This will be the focus of the Takayama lab at the University of Michigan. To develop procedures to utilize the 384 array hanging drop plate to form co-culture spheroids of PCa cells, marrow stromal cells (MSCs), and human bone marrow endothelial cells (HBMECs) similar to those prepared previously in low throughput microfluidic devices. We will also confirm quiescence of the PCa cells in these co-culture spheroids. The biological hypothesis that motivates this study is: We can treat metastatic PCa better by developing drugs that specifically target dormant metastatic PCa cells that are parasitizing the HSC niche.

In order to seal the dental implants from bacteria and consequently protect the crestal bone from infection-induced deterioration, there is an unmet need to promote a prompt and effective attachment of gingival tissue onto the implant surface. The project proposes to coat aligned biomimetic nanofibers onto the collar of dental implants for rapid adhesion and controlled growth of gingival cells along the fibers. It is anticipated that an accelerated formation of new gingival connective tissue will take place right onto the biomimetic nanofibers, leading to a proper seal of dental implants from oral cavity. The same aligned nanofibers can be useful to modify other implant surfaces for guided accelerated tissue regeneration. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the proposed cost-effective biomimetic nanofiber coating will provide a competitive solution to a common problem, i.e., infection-induced implant failure. This type of nano-fiber coated dental implants has a great potential to penetrate the rapidly growing dental implant market which is projected to be $8.1 billion by 2015. Teaming up with the leading industry partners will facilitate the commercialization of this novel technology upon completion of the proposed studies."

This novel system is Computer Aided Design (CAD) based and has the capability to directly produce bioresorbable polymer stents by using polymer pellets and powders without any intermediate steps, such as making of polymer tubesand fibers. This will drastically reduce the processing time and the cost of the bioresorbable stent fabrication process. In this project, we will first optimize PLLA stent fabrication parameters in our RSF. Stents with single and double helical patternswill be fabricated and tested for their mechanical properties. The commonly used anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative drug, rapamycin (sirolimus), and amorphous bioabsorbable polymer, poly-D,L-lactide, will be applied as drug/polymer coating in this phase I feasibility study. Mechanical properties, such as crimping and radial stiffness, acute recoil, foreshortening, will be tested. Fabricated drug elution stents will be sterilized using gamma-radiation or e-beam radiation and there in vitro drug elution profiles will be studied. The biodegradation behavior of these stents will also be characterized in vitro. Upon completion of this Phase I study, we plan to move forward by conducting a Phase II animal study in collaboration with a major stent manufacturer, such as Abbott Vascular. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bioresorbable polymer stents are the focus of the next generation stent development. With all the benefits they can offer, bioresorbable stents may become a new standard of care in peripheralartery disease. Since currently there is no FDA approved bioresorbable stents on the market yet, there is a stronger demand for both stents and new fabrication technologies that can increase stent production efficiency and reduce stent development time andcost. Using our newly developed rapid stent fabrication (RSF) system, this project will demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating drug eluting bioresorbable poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) stents with appropriate mechanical properties and a drug-eluting profileof approximately 80% drug being released in 30 days.

This SBIR Phase I proposal is to demonstrate the scaffold manufacturing feasibility by using a proprietary precision extruding deposition technique to fabricate porous 3D tissue scaffold with controlled porosity and internal architecture, and then coated the scaffold with a cell culture derived extracellular matrix (ECM) by using cell culture technology. We hypotheze that this cell culture derived biomimetic ECM coating, after proper decellularization and treatment, can offer similar biological performance as conventional tissue derived ECM in tissue engineering application. Toward this goal, we would like to demonstrate that an ECM coating can be generated onto the surface of porous tissue scaffolds. To achieve this aim, we first apply an enabling precision extruding deposition technique to freeformly fabricate porous 3D polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds with various porous structures. We then apply cell culture method to produce two types of ECM coatings using human dermal fibroblasts and human mesenchymal stem cells (under osteogeneic differentiation). We would like to further demonstrate that the decellularized biomimetic ECM coatings derived from two different cell lines (fibroblast and mesenchymal stem cells under osteogeneic differentiation) will affect osteo-differentiation of re-seeded mesenchymal stem cells. More specifically, we would like to demonstrate that the osteo- differentiated mesenchymal stem cells derived ECM coating could be used as a better ECM substrate for re-seeded mesenchymal stem cell in terms of the cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation down to the osteogeneic lineage.

Atomically precise crystal growth will be used to produce a new generation of ultra-thin single- crystal semiconductor-metal quantum heterostructures. These atomically precise heterostructures will enable new levels of performance in optoelectronic devices such as high sensitivity photodetectors, high gain and radiation hard electronic devices such as heterojunction bipolar transistors, and superconducting quantum interference devices that are used in advanced quantum computers. These quantum heterostructures and devices will be enabled by a combination of ultra-clean ultra-high vacuum crystal growth (known as epitaxy) in conjunction with precisely-dosed atomic hydrogen to facilitate atomically abrupt single-crystal interfaces that are free of defects. In Phase I of this project, ultra-thin single-crystal layers of the semiconductor silicon (Si) and the metal aluminum (Al) will be carefully deposited with lattice matching (the same atomic spacing) onto commercially available transparent, insulating yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) single-crystal substrates.

While polystyrene microspheres are the most prevalent microsphere used in bio-assays, silica microspheres are desirable for a wide variety of reasons and the glass matrix itself offers significant advantages relative to polymer-based materials. The overall research objective is to develop a low-temperature sol-gel manufacturing process that will produce a more uniform Multiplexed Bead Array Assay (MBAA) product characterized by greater chemistry consistency as compared to existing product available today. With overall success, this program will create the ability to produce a single parent microsphere capable of being transformed into at least 10 daughter microspheres, each with a unique and distinguishable autofluorescence characteristic. This transition to a novel manufacturing process for silica-based microspheres will solve many of the problems encountered with high-temperature microsphere manufacturing, while decreasing the cost limitations associated with today?s multiplexed microspheres.

Current in vitro methods for characterizing gastrointestinal absorption are based on unreliable assays, with 90% of all drugs developed ultimately failing to enter the market. Practically, these limitations delay the development of critically needed therapeutic drugs and dramatically increase drug prices and health care costs. There is, therefore, a critical need to develop more predictive in vitro testing assays that will allow for early selection of the most promising drug candidates to reduce the number of live animal studies and their associated costs, while accelerating transition from pre-clinical research to early drug development. The technology is based on the discovery, fundamental characterization and bioarchiving of adult canine intestinal stem cell lines, called 3-dimensional (3D) canine intestinal organoids. These miniguts emulate the physiology of the functional intestine much more closely than currently available methods and have the potential to provide superior drug screening over currently used assays. This SBIR Phase I is a proposal to establish that in vitro predictability of oral drug absorption can be improved using canine intestinal organoids vs. standard 2D in vitro assays, such as Caco2 and MDCK cell lines. In Aim 1, the goal is to determine intestinal absorption and permeability of therapeutic drugs as a function of disease and intestinal segment as compared with conventional in vitro models. This will be achieved by quantifying passive and active permeability of drugs, as well as drug transporter expression and function in 3D canine organoids vs. conventional cell systems. In Aim 2, the goal is to determine intestinal metabolism of therapeutic drugs as a function of disease and intestinal segment in canine organoids compared to standard in vitro models.

Augmenting the Power of Physical Models with Interactive Digital Media
Science and STEM education requires more effective tools that will engage student attention, challenge them to think
critically, and help them learn critical science literacy concepts to create a stronger workforce and citizenry. The primary
objective of the project Augmenting the Power of Physical Models with Interactive Digital Media, is to transport
students further into the molecular world by developing augmented reality (AR) modules that seamlessly extend the
value of 3D Molecular Designsâ (3DMD) models. With 3DMD AR, students will engage with 3DMDâs models in a new
way, intuitively navigating at their own pace and constructing their own knowledge while being guided by seamlessly
integrated interactive digital media. Immersed in the intrinsic dynamics of molecular structures, they will manipulate the
physical model â moving, rotating, adjusting â while digital features move in concert revealing new layers of complexity.
3DMD AR will allow educators to engage more students at middle school, high school, and undergraduate levels by
piquing their interest with cutting edge technology and game-based learning applications. The addition of AR features
to these instructional materials will not only expand the range of molecular concepts that can be taught with each
modeling kit, but will also engage a broader range of todayâs students from both economically disadvantaged schools
and remote learning environments. 3DMD AR has broad STEM commercial and educational potential. The augmented
reality modules described in this proposal can be deployed with any smart mobile device (phone or tablet), making
3DMD AR accessible to a wide range of schools and budgets.
Phase I of the project will focus on the feasibility of using augmented reality with our current physical models. The
Specific Aims of the project are:1. Test the feasibility of augmented reality software to identify and track the movement with 3DMDâs five types ofphysical models: 2D-printed graphics, die-stamped foam, plastic injection-molded molecules, 3D-printed proteins,and a flexible foam-covered modeling wire (mini toober).2. Focusing one type of physical model â injection-molded water molecules â 3DMD will test the feasibility ofaugmented reality software to: overlay a variety of types of digital media, allow user actions to trigger responsesfrom the AR software, and determine optimal techniques to interact with physical models and digital devices.
By following an internal process of iterative design, the research team will test augmented reality targeting techniques
to identify and track physical models. After targeting is achieved, the team will continue this process to develop digital
overlays, trigger responses, and ergonomics. The Education Advisory Group will inform the research team of the most
useful content to augment the physical models and critique the initial usability of the applications.Project Narrative
Augmenting the Power of Physical Models with Interactive Digital Media
The research described in this Phase I proposal will explore the use of augmented reality (AR) media to enhance the
learning power of physical models of molecular structures. Combining physical modeling with AR, 3D Molecular Designs
plans to meet students in their own digital world utilizing studentsâ devices, engaging and challenging them with STEM
bioscience content to construct their understanding of molecular processes that impact our lives, resulting in a populace
with improved science literacy and a better trained workforce."

The dynamic, multi-functional DNA model that is the focus of this Phase I project will becomean essential component of a broader molecular biology modeling kit that is envisioned as a Phase II follow-on project - in which students will use the RNA generated from this DNA model in a protein synthesis module to enact the translation of a sequence ofnucleotides into a sequence of amino acids in a protein. Together, these active learning tools will provide today's students with a foundational understanding of the molecular logic of the flow of genetic information needed to appreciate how the recent advances in genomic science will soon lead to the routine practice of personalized genomic medicine. The dynamic DNA model proposed in this project will be based on two existing DNA models: (i) an accurate 3-D model of double-stranded DNA in which each atomis color-coded according to atom type, and (ii) a model of double-stranded DNA that can be easily untwisted into a flat, 2-D ladder structure. The major design challenge that will be addressed in this project is the development and strategic placement ofthree rotatable connector features in the current accurate model of DNA such that the model can be easily inter-converted between the two forms. Additive rapid prototyping technologies will be used to prototype a variety of possible connector features andto test them in functional prototypes of a classroom model kit. This project is a collaborative effort of 3D Molecular Designs, the Rapid Prototyping Center at Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) and the MSOE Center for BioMolecular Modeling (CBM). TheCBM is an instructional materials development laboratory that works closely with high school biology and chemistry teachers to provide professional development programs focused on basic concepts of molecular structure and function.

Two different technical innovations are required to make this possible. First, new software will be created to allow the unfolding of the complex geometry of a protein into a collection of fragments, each of which is moldable. Second, further development of the PHAST rapid tooling process will be required. In this process, ceramic molds are first cast from a complex master-pattern created by rapid prototyping. The final metal injection molding tool is then created from powdered metal packed against the ceramic mold and infiltrated at high temperature with a molten copper alloy. This approach creates a hard metal injection mold with a complex geometry that would be virtually impossible to create by traditional methods, at a fraction of the cost of traditional machining. The successful completion of this project will result in the production of a collection of physical models that can be used to introduce students to concepts of molecular structure and function. No other technology currently exists with which physical models of these structures can be produced at a cost that will allow their widespread dissemination. The physical models of proteins and other molecular structures that will result from this project will be used in science classrooms at both the secondary and undergraduate levels to attract a broader spectrum of students to careers in the molecular biosciences. These physical models are especially useful in capturing the interest of under-represented minority students who might not otherwise develop an interest in pursuing careers in science."

These models become discovery tools in the hands of students, turning the abstract concepts of molecular structure and function into something real. Unfortunately, the current method of producing these models, by rapid prototyping in a one-at-a-time process, is too costly to allow the widespread dissemination of models in an educational setting. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop the technology needed to produce physical models of proteins by a novel injection molding process. We will address two problems that currently prevent the production of low cost physical models of proteins by injection molding. First, we will develop the ability to ""unfold"" the complex geometry of a protein into an unfolded state that is amenable to injection molding. Second, we will further develop PHAST, a proprietary rapid tooling method that creates hardened metal injection molding tools by a process involving mold masters created by rapid prototyping, and a series of casting steps involving ceramic materials and powdered metal. These two innovations will be applied to the creation of a physical model of the MHC protein complex by injection molding."

Current metal AM platforms use expensive core components and consumable materials in high-priced machines that produce 99.9% dense parts. The proposed project calls into question the performance requirements that most American manufacturers have for industrial grade stainless steel parts. While these manufacturers require high performance, they cannot currently afford to take advantage of AM benefits due to the high capital expenditure, maintenance, and operating costs associated with current commercial technologies. This proposal re-examines the material performance, machine cost and reliability requirements necessary for a novel metal AM system to satisfy most American manufacturers' needs. In developing a low-cost AM alternative, the goal of the proposal is to allow an estimated over 50,000 American manufacturers to capitalize on the benefits of AM and simultaneously compete in an ultra-competitive, highly globalized manufacturing industry. In addition, procurement for low to medium volume order quantities (1000 - 20,000 pieces) is incredibly challenging with respect to high cost and long lead times. The proposed invention of a low-cost machine allows for never seen scalability in metal AM, allowing for smaller manufacturers to scale by taking advantage of meaningful order quantities and compete with the resources of large conglomerates. This research has broad implications in many industries and could be fundamentally enabling for the growth and prosperity of American manufacturing.

Today, primary care physicians often refer patients with these conditions to dermatologists for the initial diagnosis and multiple follow-up appointments, especially when patients are prescribed high cost, high touch therapies like biologics or procedures, such as phototherapy. By introducing this automated severity scoring system, these providers will have the expertise of dermatologists at their fingertips, giving them the ability to assess disease severity and provide systemic treatments previously available only through specialists.

For pharmaceutical companies, the ability to have non-specialists make these severity assessments during clinical trials reduces expensive and restrictive staffing requirements. Less expensive trials can help expedite new drugs to market. This innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding by applying known machine learning techniques in a novel manner to solve a difficult visual problem. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will prototype a clinical tool that can assess images of a chronic skin inflammation, determine its severity, and suggest treatment.

Currently, clinicians trying to assess the severity of chronic inflammatory skin diseases rely on a series of estimations and manual weighted averages, a time consuming and biased process. This Phase I research will explore what information is necessary for an algorithm to determine the severity of a psoriasis case. It will determine if it is possible for a machine to guide an imager through imaging regions of interest at higher detail, rather than the entire body at large.

The proposed technology consists of an easy to use imager and web interface that allows patients to take clinical quality 2D and 3D images from the comfort of their homes. These images are uploaded automatically to a web interface and are analyzed to track changes in size and color. The images are also displayed for the dermatologist to review and monitor remotely.

After manufacturing a small number of imagers, a study will be conducted to test their effectiveness as a home monitoring system. Feedback from the dermatologists and patients who use the system will be used to improve the early prototype and prepare for commercialization. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the system?s expected ability to make teledermatology practical. This can revolutionize the current standard of dermatological care by allowing dermatologists to diagnose patients quickly and inexpensively. Dermatologists currently use magnifying lenses and digital cameras to image patients? skin lesions, but these methods do not have the capability to take standardized images and log them over time. More advanced equipment exists but is too expensive and complicated for patient use. The technology will capture an untapped market for a low cost skin monitoring solution that automatically creates electronic patient histories. Such a system could be of use in rural or remote areas, including developing countries, where dermatological care is unavailable or substandard. Additionally, the system can create a large database of de-identified images and case files from consenting patients.

For direct-write antennas, antenna performance has been somewhat limited because the resistivity achieved so far with nanoparticle inks is 2-4 times the resistivity of bulk metals. Antennas have also been fabricated by laser powder bed technology, but this technology requires an appreciable investment in equipment, has health issues associated with powders, and some fabricated antennas have exhibited roughness that can impact performance whereby a post-process machining step is required. When combined with laser cutting and welding, the recent work by ARL in laser folding and origami metal working opens up new possibilities for manufacturing antennas using a variety of sheet metals with high fabrication precision and bulk metal conductivity, as required for mm-wave antennas. Millimeter wave antennas require small features because the free-space wavelength is on the order of a few millimeters (f=30-300 GHz Â« l =10-1mm). Â In addition to bending/forming by CW or nanosecond pulse lasers, femtosecond laser pulses can be used for high precision milling, cutting, and micro-adjustments. We propose to determine a library of laser/beamforming parameters to enable laser forming, cutting, and welding of copper, steel, aluminum, and brass. Fortunately, for laser forming and welding, we will not be starting from scratch on this effort because there are already numerous reports in the literature on laser forming, both experimental and modelling.

This facilitates rapid on-site prototyping of conformal and non-conformal antennas. For proof of concept in Phase I, we will design, simulate, and laser-fabricate a shunt slot array antenna at S or C band to demonstrate basic capability. For proof of concept in the Phase I option period, we will develop 5-axis fabrication processes and fabricate a 3D conical sinuous antenna."

New near room temperature 3D direct ink writing (DIW) additive manufacturing (AM) printing processes allow many different type of sensors and they can be embedded anywhere in a structure, which offers several benefits. 1. Protection: sensors face degradation from impact, heat exposure, corrosion, wear, and so on. 2. Design freedom: 3D printing enables electronics and conductive traces to be placed anywhere in a structure. 3. Anti-tampering: physically hiding devices and sensors inside a structure can be the best protection from manipulation, alteration, deactivation, and/or damage from the outside elements. The combination of subtractive (CNC milling) and additive (CNC extrusion) stages allows components to be integrated into existing parts and in some cases, allows complete manufacture of a part with sensors embedded during the manufacturing process. A major difference with a 3DFlexible (3DF) hybrid additive manufacturing (hAM) system, compared to other 3D printing technologies, is its low processing temperature.

In particular, diagnostic and imaging technologies are needed to assess the effectiveness of new extraction techniques related to drilling, completion, and stimulation. This project will develop three-dimensional, multicomponent seismic data analysis, interpretation, and application techniques for detecting variations in lithology, porosity, pore fluid content (i.e. discriminating oil, water, and gas), and bulk reservoir properties. These techniques will allow better imaging of geologic structure and improved reservoir characterization in structurally complex land areas, enabling the direct detection of natural gas resources by discriminating between oil, water, and gas content. The technology is based on creating angle gathers for both P-wave and S-wave amplitude-versus-angle (AVA) analysis. Unlike traditional amplitude-versus-offset (AVO) gathers, AVA gathers provide a direct assessment for inverting P-wave and S-wave reflectivity for seismic lithology, porosity, and pore fluid content. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The three-dimensional multicomponent seismic data should be much more effective for characterizing and delineating oil reservoirs and for monitoring enhanced-oil-recovery processes, especially in extremely complicated geological conditions such as the deep Rocky Mountain basins. Accurate and higher resolution imaging in these areas should reduce extraction and development costs, and increase both the amount of hydrocarbons recovered and the amount of national oil and gas reserves that can be produced economically."

The proposed work will transform the Phase I prototype into production-ready commercial quality software, and demonstrate it on 3-D seismic data. The key technical innovations of the Phase II project are (1) a multi-resolution data visualizer, (2) a data-staging tool, and (3) a multi-channel collaboration tool to support collaborative visualization and data analysis on the grid. The proposed technology will allow multiple users to share and interact with multidimensional grid-dispersed data sets, while viewing independent multiple renderings with resolutions and bandwidths commensurate to their local display and network capabilities. The proposed technology will be enabled by implementing several grid services, and a virtual file system, that make grid deployed data sets appear local to the user. This implementation comprises the bulk of the technical tasks, and leverages the middleware. The immediate outcome of the Phase II project will be a version of Internet Seismic Processing production software (INSP) with specialized features for remote visualization, data staging, and collaborative analysis of seismic images on the grid. The ultimate objective of the Phase II project is a commercial grid-enabled software product providing scientific data, services, computing power, and visualization on demand, not only to the oil and gas industry but to a much wider range of application areas, such as geographic information systems, education, medical imaging, and battlefield management. The product will push the limits of what can be done, and fully contribute to a new business paradigm, made possible by the advent of the grid, allowing businesses to concentrate on their core competencies and rely on other entities for grid-enabled context technologies, without deterring from their primary objectives. The outcome of Phase II will be a commercial implementation and utilization of the grid, and the toolkit, which up until now, has been used mostly in academic and research applications. This technology will first be commercialized in a strategically important economic sector; namely, for the exploration of new energy resources.

The software will be optimized for deployment on Linux clusters, and testing will be conducted to determine the optimal geophysical parameters for obtaining the best possible images. The project involves significant computer engineering to obtain the maximum efficiency required to image terabyte size data sets and significant geophysical work to demonstrate the validity of the approach.This advanced imaging methodology will improve success rate and cost effectiveness for new field discoveries and increase recovery efficiency for the development of existing fields.This technology is a fundamental revolutionary advance, and is a necessary building block in any seismic processing system that images 3-D prestack data using wave-equation methods for imaging deep water, under-salt complex geological structures which are the focus of modern oil and gas exploration. Societal and economic benefits from the proposed VAWEM technology will accrue directly to the nation by lowering energy costs and reducing dependence on foreign energy sources. Energy is at the core of the U.S. and world economies; therefore, the political, societal, and economic benefits of the proposed technology go well beyond the substantial direct economic benefit that this technology will bring to the proposing company and its customers. Commercial potential of the proposed technology is directly applicable to the fastest growing and strategically most important area of U.S. exploration, namely the deepwater subsalt oil and gas province of the Gulf of Mexico federal waters. It is estimated that most of the Gulf&#039;s untapped resources (45 Billion barrels of oil and 207 trillion cubic feet of natural gas) are trapped in deepwater subsalt reservoirs, and in ultra deep (over 15,000 ft) gas deposits. Since exploratory wells in these areas typically cost more than $30 million, tapping these reserves will require advanced imaging technology such as VAWEM to reduce risk and make exploration feasible.

A series of heat treatments based on the NASA IP will be performed on the samples. Surface quality, internal defects, and homogeneity of the samples will be evaluated via optical microscopy, SEM, and EDS. Heat-treated samples will be analyzed in a series of thermomechanical and microstructural analysis. The transformation temperatures as well as precipitates will be analyzed using DSC, TEM, and XRD characterization. Thermomechanical properties of the samples will also be evaluated via compression test and isobaric compression test at different stress levels. The homogeneity and potential defects will be analyzed in these steps and the obtained data will be evaluated with reported data by the NASA team.A comprehensive report will be prepared.

Additive manufacturing AM is increasingly being used in the medical for applications as diverse as printing
prosthesis and implants of ceramic and metallic materials and even organs using soft materials and live tissue
 bioprinting  In AM a computer aided design CAD file is processed and sent to a D printer to print the
desired shape which reduces time and cost compared to the traditional polymer or metal working methods
Figure a presents an example of a mandibular reconstruction plate design and Figure b shows the D

printed from the stolen CAD files can be identified The project is based on a new design methodology
developed by the PI Zeltmann and co PI Gupta which is now patent pending and formed the basis for
establishing DP Security Inc for its commercialization This new methodology takes advantage of the layer
by layer manufacturing of AM processes and has potential for developing security features that will be invisible
to unsuspecting people In the presence of such features the component will print in high quality only under a
pre determined set of conditions while any other condition will result in a severely defective component that
will be unsuitable for use This design methodology is used in the present proposal to print identification codes
in the genuine implants
Specific Aim
An identification code will be embedded in the mandibular implant A process will be developed so that the
embedded code can be printed in the material only under certain file processing conditions for D printing All
other processing conditions will ignore the presence of the code This scheme will also help in identification of
genuine products from counterfeits which may have been printed from stolen files and possibly using inferior
quality materials The code will be sliced into several sections and embedded in different layers of the material
by taking advantage of the layer by layer manufacturing process Such possibilities are unique to additive
manufacturing and do not exist in other traditional manufacturing methods such as casting and forging
Mechanical tests will be conducted to ensure that the embedded code does not compromise the quality of the
product in any way Tensile tests will be conducted on the specimens to determine the properties of the implant
with and without the embedded codes
Specific Aim
A software utility will be developed that will take the STL files of the implant design as inputs and embed the
security code in them This utility will first generate a desired tracking code slice this code into several parts
and then embed it in the STL file in such a way that each slice of the code prints in a different layer in the
implant The Phase I effort will demonstrate the utility developed in MATLAB The utility will take into account
the D printing technology used for that product and the processing parameter in order to develop the desired

If successfully completed, this program will, for the first time, enable the AM industry to go beyond the qualification metrics documented in the A/B basis for a quick and semi-automated qualification procedure which would increase accuracy for additively fabricated metal parts (since the energy source scale and length scale of part fabrication are strongly coupled with the microstructure). The test methodology related to this qualification procedure will be first analyzed with regard to parts of NAVAIR interest but could be generalized for any complex geometry manufactured using powder-bed metal AM technologies."

Currently, computational build volume optimization consider efficient bed packing above the build plate in 3 dimensions without optimizing global residual stress. Thus, multiple experimental iterations are required to eliminate cracks arising from tensile residual stresses. Similarly, support generation algorithms are not optimized for efficient heat transfer and multiple experimental iterations are needed to optimize for the best configurations. 3DSIMs exaSIM software creates support structures which can counteract local residual stress, however the support structures are not designed for efficient heat transfer and minimization of residual stresses. Additive manufacturing is severely hampered due to these issues, and there is a need to fabricate parts right the first time to enable widespread industrial adoption. The proposed work will result in validated build optimization tools which minimize global and local residual stress. These algorithms enable fabrication of non-generic, non-linear topologically optimized contact and non-contact support structures for better heat transfer and 3-Dimensional part nesting. Phases II and III will investigate changes in defect and mechanical property distributions due to these non-traditional supports, giving the Navy an all-inclusive build optimization tool."

Defecatory disorders such as chronic constipation (CC) and fecal incontinence (FI) affect 25% of the population
and the incidence is rising. These disorders pose a major health care burden and are poorly recognized and
treated. The need for better diagnostics and therapeutics is substantial. CC, a symptom of underlying defecatory
disease, affects 12-19% of Americans with expenditure on laxatives being nearly $1B yearly. Another defecatory
disorder is FI, which affects 10% of the population and its incidence is rising. Approximately 15% of the population
in USA over 70 years of age as well as 10% of those under 70 suffer from FI. It is an under-diagnosed problem
due to patients often being too embarrassed to seek medical help. The mechanisms of defecation and continence
depend on colorectal motility, stool consistency, rectal capacity and compliance, anorectal sensitivity, and
coordination of the pelvic floor muscles and sphincter. Management options for these patients are limited due to
the multifactorial control of defecation and continence; and the difficulties in identifying the exact cause of CC
and FI with current diagnostics. Precise diagnosis is necessary to judge if the patient is eligible for biofeedback
treatment. 3DTs multimodal Fecobionics device is a novel, anorectal natural orifice insertable device that
provides high resolution pressures, orientation, bending, and shape during defecation of the device. It simulates
feces and electronically measures relevant parameters of defecation such as the propulsive force, anal sphincter
relaxation, and anorectal angle. Results from previous studies have shown safe and distinctive recordings of
important anorectal function parameters. Specifically, the device did not cause tissue injury to rectum or the anal
canal as verified by visual inspection of mucosa and histological examination. Fecobionics evacuations in non-
GLP pig studies showed characteristic pressure profiles and orientation/bending data obtained with wired as well
as wireless transmission. Furthermore, simultaneous data from human studies outside of the US have provided
the first-in-man studies with the initial wired prototypes of Fecobionics. The human studies have confirmed that
the device is safe and easy-to-use in the clinical setting with integration of most current tests in one, and high
degree of agreement with key parameters obtained with the balloon expulsion test and defecography. Distinct
differences were found, however, when compared to the manometry âgold standardâ as there are also difference
between current clinical tests. To advance these outstanding findings and to move closer to commercialization
of Fecobionics, this Fast track proposal intends to accomplish the following: Phase I Aim 1: Modification of filling

anorectal angle and pressure measurements, and 3) 510(k) submission. To obtain data for submission of 510(k)

The number of percutaneous arterial access procedures using the transradial access (TRA) approach is growing
rapidly in the US. Interventionalists are adopting the TRA technique due to lower risks associated with bleeding
and no need for active vascular closure devices. TRA catheterization also satisfies patients because of increased
comfort and mobility. Same-day discharge is generally possible, which lowers costs for patients and health
insurance companies. Radial artery spasm (RAS) is the most common complication encountered with the TRA
technique, however, making access difficult and/or causing sheath entrapment. RAS can be painful for patients
and is difficult for interventionalists to manage. Various pharmacological agents are used, but there are two
problems with that strategy. First, there is no generally accepted drug regimen with proven efficacy in treating
RAS. Second, pharmacological treatment is initiated only after a problem has arisen. Since the clinically
important problem of RAS persists, we propose a completely different approach to mitigating this complication;
i.e., electrical-induced relaxation of radial artery smooth muscle cells by use of electrified needle (e-needle). Our
preliminary data show that the radial artery dilates in response to electrical stimulation with extracellular
electrodes. This observation leads us to hypothesize that TRA devices can be transformed into vasodilating
extracellular electrodes (with the return path provided by a skin patch electrode). Our aim is to assemble a
prototype device and demonstrate its safety and efficacy in vivo in swine. The novel access e-needle will be
used under ultrasound guidance to simultaneously measure radial artery diameter and assess prototype efficacy.
Further, safety will be determined by measuring the electrocardiogram and arterial blood pressure during
prototype use as well as histopathology after explanting the swine radial artery. Our novel approach to RAS
promises to shift the current clinical paradigm from one of ad hoc attempts at pharmacological management (in
which there is no consistency, but undesired side effects like hypotension) to one based on well-understood
biophysical and biomedical engineering principles. Our project offers to improve patient care and save time for
physicians with a novel TRA e-needle that dilates the artery it contacts the vessel for access. This will spare
patients the pain of experiencing vasospasm, eliminate risks from unnecessary pharmacological agents, lower
medical costs, and improve physician efficiency.NARRATIVE
Percutaneous arterial catheterization, used in a wide variety of procedures including angiography and stent
placement, is traditionally done through the femoral artery, but physicians are increasingly opting to use an artery
in the wrist. This is a development for patients, who can quickly recover and walk out of the hospital the same
day; however, radial access spasm is a frequent complication that is painful for patients and challenging for
doctors. Our project is aimed at using safe and effective electrical stimulation through the access needle to relax
the radial artery to enhance patient comfort, improve physician efficiency, and reduce health care costs."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, affecting 1-2% of the population, and about 8% of
individuals over 80 years of age. AF has been identified as the leading cause of thromboembolic events such as
stroke. Every hour, approximately 15 patients with AF will suffer from a stroke in the US. Although prevention of
cardioembolic stroke is clinically and economically critical, traditional oral anticoagulation therapy does not have
satisfactory compliance, along with number of drawbacks. It is estimated that more than 90% of thrombi
responsible for thromboembolic events in AF form in the left atrial appendage (LAA) due to its narrow apex (blind
end), unsmooth inner surface, and irregular contraction. Excision or exclusion of the LAA with devices provides
a novel treatment strategy for preventing thromboembolic events in AF patients. There are two types of devices;
i.e., epicardial suture/clip, which closes the LAA from outside the heart, and endocardially deployed occluder,
which eliminates the dead space from the inside. The current devices have some significant disadvantages,
however, such as high cost, foreign body retention, migration, etc. The epicardial device seems to achieve better
results than endocardial device but the epicardial approach is harder to access. In this Phase I proof of concept
proposal, the objective is to partially invert the LAA endoluminally to make it resorb over time. This best of both
world approach (efficacy of clipping or resorption through an endoluminal approach) should be superior to
existing devices and methods. The hypothesis is that the inversion of the LAA will change the stress distribution
(homeostasis) in the appendage by reducing the tensile stress and even create some compressive stresses in
the tissue where a reduction in stress or compression will cause resorption as per growth-stress law. The major
deliverable is to demonstrate the safety of LAA inversion as assessed by EKG, echocardiography, histology,
cardiac biomarkers, and neurohormones to establish a new paradigm of LAA resorption as opposed to LAA
occlusion or exclusion. Our preliminary data show feasibility of this approach in a swine model where the partial
inversion of LAA was implemented surgically and endovascularly and found to eliminate the LAA dead space. In
the open-chest procedure in swine, we performed measurements at 4 weeks post-surgery, showing the inversion
of LAA is safe (no arrythmia, no hemodynamic or cardiac changes) and effective (LAA was resorbed). Compared
to current LAA closure devices, our approach leaves nothing behind (i.e., no implanted device) and hence will
be safer and much less expensive. This innovative concept along with the development of percutaneous method

Despite the physiologic importance of the lymphatic system (LS), it has been arguably the most neglected part
of circulatory system, primarily because of a lack of robust imaging and interventional methods. Traditional pedal
lymphangiography (PL; i.e., direct cannulation of the lymphatic vessels), has significant technical, time, cost, and
image quality challenges. Recently, the field of lymphatic imaging and intervention underwent revival due to the
development of intranodal lymphangiography (IL) and thoracic duct embolization (TDE). IL was developed as a
technically simple alternative to pedal lymphangiography. IL is performed by accessing the lymph nodes with a
spinal needle using ultrasound guidance. It provides imaging that is superior to PL and is now the leading method
of imaging of the lymphatic system worldwide. Although the IL technique has many advantages over PL, there
are remaining problems because a spinal needle is not designed specifically for this application. Limitations of
IL include: 1) Difficulty of introducing needle into lymphatic node (LN), because of mobility of the LN within the
loose subcutaneous tissue; 2) Difficulty in positioning the needle precisely in the central part of the LN; 3) Lack
of a stabilization mechanism of the needle in LN during intervention and patient transfer. The last issue results
in frequent dislodgement of the needle, greatly impairing the quality of the imaging and decreasing the success
of the lymphatic procedures. TDE is a minimally invasive technique developed to treat the pulmonary lymphatic
disorders. During TDE, the access to the TD is obtained transabdominally using a long 21-22 G needle. Similarly
to the issues with IL listed above, the needle is not specially designed for TD intervention and leads to the
following shortcomings: 1) The needles are not sharp enough to traverse the long route of compliant tissue; 2)
The needle is not sufficiency rigid, so it is difficult to have fine control of the tip of the needle; 3) The sharp angle
of access to the TD makes it difficult to manipulate the wire in the TD, resulting frequently in shearing; and 4)
The choice of needle length is very limited. Lymphatic imaging and TD interventions are both time-consuming
and technically challenging and remain a major hurdle to the detection and treatment of lymphatic disorders.
Therefore, innovative LS access tools are critical to the progress of lymphatic intervention. The goals of the
proposal are to determine the safety and effectiveness of novel LN and TD needles in vivo in swine to address
the issues above. An innovative lymphatic-specific toolkit has advantages over existing access kits, which is
demonstrated by our preliminary data. Due to its simplicity, safety, and effectiveness to access the LS, our new
toolkit will have broad utility to enable wider use of diagnostic access and treatments in the LS. This specially
designed novel toolkit will considerably improve the success of lymphatic imaging and intervention, enhance
patient comfort, increase physician efficiency, and lower medical costs by improving efficiency and efficacy.NARRATIVE
Although lymphatic interventions have increased substantially over the last decades worldwide, the lack of
dedicated lymphatic intervention tools presents technical challenges in performing the lymphatic procedures and
hence has limited diagnosis and interventions for lymphatic disorders. Our project is aimed at developing a
novel lymphatic access toolkit to address the existing problems and to facilitate the technical success of
lymphatic imaging and intervention, therefore improving clinical success, lower medical costs, and reducing x-
ray exposure to patients and physicians through easier and quicker access into lymphatic system."

post thrombotic syndrome and innovative approaches for their prevention and treatment  Chronic venous
insufficiency CVI affectsof American adults and is the seventh most common debilitating disease with
treatment costs of $billion annually One of the major contributors to venous insufficiency is valve
incompetence that causes blood flow reflux venous hypertension HTN and potentially thrombosis Previous
attempts to develop a prosthetic venous valve to treat reflux have failed primarily due to a lack of basic
understanding of the interactions between the prosthetic device and the host biological environment that
ultimately led to the complete thrombosis of the implants Recently we have had success with a novel biomaterial
that is remarkably thrombo resistant when applied to the low flow environment of the venous valve The
objectives of this Phase I SBIR proposal are To refine the female Greyhound model so that it is predictive
of the biological outcomes of venous valve replacement andTo evaluate a novel prosthetic venous valve
device in the CVI animal model The central hypothesis is that persistent venous reflux is detrimental to
endothelial venous function and that a mechanically informed well designed bioprosthetic venous valve can
restore the mechanical environment and hence biological homeostasis The primary task of this Phase I is to
assess the safety and efficacy of a prosthetic venous valve for treatment of CVI in a translational large animal
model that recapitulates venous reflux HTN and thrombosis observed in patients with CVI Our rationale is
based on the following pillars A Valve insufficiency and significant reflux HTN must be treated to avoid
endothelial dysfunction in CVI and subsequent sequela deep vein thrombosis limb edema skin ulcerations
etcand B No prosthetic valve can function long term in the absence of certain threshold of blood flow and
pressure gradient Hence safety and efficacy testing of any bioprosthetic valve must be made in an appropriate
animal model that allows the charging of the valve i e  presence of reflux HTN propensity for thrombosis
etcTo treat venous reflux HTN a rigorously tested prosthetic valve is needed that functions under wide range
of pathophysiological hemodynamic conditions The proposed animal model of venous reflux HTN can then be
used to validate the functionality of the venous valve under a range of hemodynamics conditions in a chronic
canine model Our strong preliminary data on the large animal venous reflux HTN thrombosis model and the
associated insidious effects on venous function along with the patency and competency of the prosthetic venous
valve based on the thrombosis resistant properties of novel lung plural ligament PL tissue positions us well for
undertaking the proposed program The success of this proposal may ultimately provide therapy for millions
of CVI patients to substantially impact healthcare costs NARRATIVE

access procedures are used for atrial fibrillation ablation left atrial appendage occlusion and patent
foramen ovale closure as well as treatment of mitral valve regurgitation with the MitraClip MC  Catheter
positioning and device placement for MC has been challenging even for the most experienced
interventionalist cardiologists ICs and has led to long procedure times with significant x ray exposure This
emerging therapy necessitates a higher level of catheter stability and control over accuracy during puncture of
the fossa ovalis FO  If the initial puncture is inaccurate delivery of therapy is virtually impossible which often
requires removal re engagement and device re advancement Thus initial localization and stabilization
on the FO is critical for MC procedures to limit delivery times and x ray exposure Additionally the presence
of aneurysmal or fibrotic FO and the constant movement of the heart makes standard TS access puncture
unpredictable and contributes to increased risk for atrial or aortic perforation To overcome these limitations we
have developed and validated the performance and utility of a novel transseptal access catheter TSAC that
utilizes vacuum suction technology to provide improved catheter localization and stabilization of the FO The
results of our preclinical studies were highly successful and support that through stabilization of the FOfold

designed to provide the no option patient with an alternative that is not reliant on a repairable arterial system
That is to leverage a staged approach for coronary retroperfusion with a novel venous pressure
preconditioning VPP device Development of the VPP device has focused on overcoming limitations
associated with coronary retroperfusion that have stemmed from abrupt increases in perfusion pressure
leading to edema and hemorrhage of the myocardium Our approach avoids acutely raising the pressure in the
coronary veins from venousmmHg to arterial values mmHg in a single step and instead
regulates the pressure at an intermediate level between arterial and venous levels  Current efforts from our
group has demonstrated that intermediate elevations in venous pressure can arterialize venous segments and
is a key requirement for preventing myocardial damage associated with venous retroperfusion at arterial
pressures These findings re open the door for retroperfusion and hence can provide a therapy for no option
patients through coronary venous bypass grafting CVBG  Therefore the overall objective of this proposal is
to validate the safety and efficacy of a VPP device that can arterialize coronary venous vessels to serve as a
therapeutic bridge to CVBG Bench testing and refinement of the self expanding device supports the
percutaneous delivery of the VPP which can increase the pulsatility as well as mean pressure under simulated
coronary venous conditions both of which are primary stimulants for arterialization of veins Together our

Percutaneous transluminal artery (PTA) treatment of severe PAD involves the use of balloons and stents, but delivery of these therapies is often suboptimal due to inaccuracies in angiographic assessment of vessel size or a lack of proper functional vessel assessment. Additional tools aid clinicians in accurately determining vessel size and function, but these are often unused because of the added time, cost, training, and interpretation required. Guidewires are used in every interventional procedure, so the ability of a guidewire to provide not only a stable platform for therapy delivery, but also a diagnostic tool for vessel structure and function would bevaluable. We have developed a fully functional 0.035 LumenRECON (LR) guidewire that has the same mechanical properties as a standard Wholey workhorse guidewire, but also uses electrical impedance technology to assess vessel lumen size and stenosis pressure drop. Thus, the guidewire provides a 3-in-1 functionality (i.e. one workhorse guidewire that acts as a platform for therapy delivery, vessel sizing, and stenosis pressure drop assessment). In this Phase I proposal, we will perform a pre-clinical study tovalidate the functionality of our 0.035 LumenRECON (LR) guidewire as a standard workhorse guidewire for vessel navigation and an accurate diagnostic tool for luminal sizing and pressure drop measurements in large animals. To accomplish the Phase I objectives, the safety, along with accuracy and repeatability of the sizing (specific aim #1) and pressure drop (specific aim #2) measurements will be assessed in domestic swine and measured against current clinically used tools, such as intravascular ultrasound(IVUS), quantitative angiography (QA), and pressure wires. This proposal addresses the significant and growing national epidemic of PAD and addresses an area that is growing, yet often overlooked. Successful completion of the proposed Aims will allow us to translate our research findings into a device that could drastically improve the treatment of PAD.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Determination of arterial lumen size and function is critical, but often not assessed adequately during peripheral interventions.

In the U.S. and/or Europe, TS access procedures are used for atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation, left atrial appendage (LAA) closure, patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure, and treatment of mitral valve regurgitation (MR). For the latter, treatment of severe MR can be accomplished through TSaccess and the placement of a clip (MitraClip or MC) on the mitral valve. Catheter positioning for MC placement has been challenging even for the most experienced interventionalist cardiologists (ICs) and has led to long procedure times with significant x-ray exposure. The initial TS access entry point into the left side of the heart s the key factor for MC placement. TS access procedures have not significantly changed since early reports by Ross in 1959 ( drag and drop technique) and many challenges stillexist with this method including difficulty with: catheter localization, catheter stabilization, and the risk f atrial wall or aortic puncture. While the drag and drop technique provides an optimal inferior septal access point for ablation procedures, the MC procedure requires a more superior/posterior puncture site due to the multiple turns required by the catheter for final clip placement. While this superior/posterior position can be located with echocardiography, the constant movement of the heart and the thin and slippery nature of the fossa ovalis (FO) make standard TS access punctures unpredictable. Access that is too high or too low relative to the mitral valve can make implantation of the MC virtually impossible thus requiring device removal, TSre-puncture, and device re-advancement. Thus, initial localization on the FO with subsequent stabilization prior to and during TS access is critical for MC procedures to limit implant times and x-ray exposure. In this proposal, we will validate the abilityof a novel, deflectable transseptal access catheter (TSAC) that utilizes vacuum suction technology to provide improved catheter localization and stabilization, easier puncture of the FO, and thus leading to decreased TS and MC procedural and x-ray exposure times. To accomplish this goal, we will assess both the safety and the ability of the TSAC to reduce procedure and x-ray exposure times for delivery of MC relative to traditional means for TS access in human cadavers with heart failure and in chronic heart failure swine with MR. This proposal addresses a clinically significant problem with applications that can reach beyond treatment of MR to multiple TS left heart procedures.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to achieve adequate localization and stabilization of the left atrium during atrial transseptal puncture is important for numerous procedures, including the delivery of mitral clips for the treatment of mitral valve regurgitation. The purpose of this Phase I SBIR is to validate the ability of a novel, low profile suction catheter to provide safe and stable access across the atrial septum for decreased procedural and fluoroscopic exposure time and to improve therapy delivery."

Patients with stable and acute coronary conditions are often treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), including stenting. Up to 85% of all coronary stents are under-deployed leading to higher target revascularization rates (TVR), in-stent restenosis, in-stent thrombosis, and therefore, higher mortality. Under-deployment is related to several factors, including inaccurate manufacturer ex vivo versus in vivo pressure/diameter compliance relationships, and thus requires further post-dilatation typically with a stiffer, non-compliant balloon. However, post-dilatation balloons still fail to provide adequate expansion because, similar to the stent deployment balloons, they also rely on ex vivo compliance charts to determine in vivo size. Consequently, a tool is needed to provide accurate balloon sizing information to the clinician in real-time during balloon inflation. A novel conductance balloon (CB) catheter system has been developed that functions as a typical post-dilatation catheter, but with additional functionality for accurate measurement and display of real-time balloon size. The CB catheter utilizes a simple physical law (Ohm's Law) to determine the balloon cross-sectional area (CSA)/diameter through electrical voltage measurements made inside the device during inflation. The sizing results are displayed in-real time on a simple bed-side console display to aid the physician during balloon expansion (i.e., similar to current displays that show pressure during inflation). Preliminary results with the CB catheter system on the bench and in vivo in healthy swine showed excellent accuracy (1.4% diameter error), repeatability (1.1% diameter error), and safety. However, additional work is needed to update the console and catheter and further validate the system in atherosclerotic swine (this PhaseI application) before translation to the clinic (future Phase II application). Therefore, in this Phae I application, we propose the creation of a clinically-ready CB catheter system and its validation in vivo in atherosclerotic swine. Based on the strongphysics foundation of the technology, the excellent preliminary results, and the previously known safety of a related system, the CB catheter system is expected to provide highly accurate and repeatable real-time digital display of balloon size across theentire coronary stent range in any type of diseased vessel condition with virtually no physician training required. After the completion of this Phase I project, we expect a quick and logical translation of the CB catheter system to a Phase II project in man. This project has the ability to impact patients with multiple comorbidities and reach across various NIH Institutes and Centers including the NIDDK, NHLBI, and NINDS.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A post-dilatation devicethat does not rely on inaccurate pressure/diameter compliance charts is needed to ensure minimal stent area and stent apposition during percutaneous coronary intervention.

The World Health Organization estimates over 1.6 billion adults (age 15+) are overweight, and at least 400 million are considered obese. In response, there has been increasing interest in the surgical treatment of morbid obesity with the application of laparoscopic techniques. Our major objective is to establish the safety and efficacy of a Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy, VSG-like device referred to as the gastric sleeve implant (GSI). The major advantage of GSI is that it does not require gastrectomy and hence leaves the anatomy and physiology of the stomach intact. Furthermore, the implant is reversible and can be removed if desired by the patient and physician. In phase I of this SBIR, we will focus on the validation of the GSI in an in vivo dog model. Therefore, our specific aim is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a reversible GSI for weight loss in a group of dogs. The device is designed to be implanted laparoscopically, and to be readily removed after implantation if desired, leaving the patient's anatomy healthy, intact, and physiologically normal. The net result of the GSI procedure is a vertical sleeve, or banana-shaped, food track, which is a fraction of the size of the original stomach. The stomach tissue excluded from the food track remains healthy and unharmed, but the digestive volume is restricted to limit the patient's food intake. The GSI mimics the benefits of the increasingly popular VSG, but it inherently avoids some of the shortcomings of the VSG and other commonly used bariatric procedures. These current procedures all suffer from one or more of the following shortcomings: 1) Leaks and complications, especially from staple lines; 2) Nutritional deficiencies from malabsortive therapies; 3) Frequent follow-up appointments for adjustments; and 4) Insufficient and/or unsustained weight loss amongst others. The design of the proposed GSI and our preliminary data address some of these shortcomings.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major objective of this proposal is to establish the safety and efficacy of an implant bariatric device. The major advantage of this weight loss device is that it does not require excision and removal of the stomach and hence leaves the anatomy and physiology of the stomach intact.

With this widespread proliferation of RF technology has come a myriad of problems such as how to architect the WLAN for optimum performance, how to easily set-up and configure the WLAN and how to secure the WLAN to protect it from hackers. Solutions for such problems are available and still evolving.  However, a newly recognized and just as insidious problem has gotten a lot of attention recently; that is the problem of Spectrum Management.Develop advanced hardware and software technologies for analysis and management of the RF component of shipboard wireless networks.In this SBIR Phase I we plan to demonstrate the feasibility of spectrum management for a wireless network system that utilizes the common unlicensed frequency bands and has the ability to shift to other desired frequency bands. The solution developed will address improvement of throughput through avoidance of interference as well as the ability to avoid the usage of specified frequencies when required by policy. We will accomplish this through the use of extensions to an existing WLAN Management System coupled with adding special purpose spectral analysis ICs to wireless Access Points. Comprehensive spectrum management will include provisions for spectral analysis and characterization as well as RF emitter location techniques. Advanced power management coupled with the use of directional and smart antenna technology is another key aspect of this project. The primary focus will be development of system suitable for handling the complex shipboard RF environment. The system will be capable of being used for Naval and military applications, including requirements for ruggedization, electromagnetic compatibility, information assurance and open architecture.

These treatment technologies are potentially capable of eliminating sludge and producing an effluent suitable for overboard discharge. Under Phase I of this project, WASTECH proposes to design a prototype wastewater treatment system that will provide the most economical means of shipboard treatment of sewage and gray water for overboard discharge and/or reuse, as appropriate. WASTECH&#039;s treatment technology involves the microwave incineration of toilet solids, resulting in no sludge generation, as well as ceramic filtration of effluent to significantly reduce the suspended solids concentration in discharge effluent. In addition, WASTECH has developed complementary technologies to disinfect the effluent and reduce dissolved organic matter.

The intent is to improve process operations and equipment reliability, availability, and maintainability without costly upgrades. Of course, these gains must be achieved without impacting combat readiness. Downsizing is also taking its toll on operations. Loss of personnel, particularly those who represent the corporate history, is depleting the Navy of its valuable experiential base which has been so heavily relied on in the past.  These realizations are causing the Navy to rethink its condition-based maintenance policies, moving them away from reacting to equipment problems to taking a proactive approach to anticipate needs based on mission requirements. This SBIR will develop a new approach to condition-based maintanance-Context Dependent Prognostics and Health Assessment. This advanced diagnostics capability will be developed around a context dependent model that provides a capability to anticipate incipient system/element failures and determine machine performance over a protracted period of time. This prognostic capability will link mission requirements to an economic performance model. In this context, a system may provide 100% operability with less than 100% functionality.

An IPC coating will enable kenaf, flax, jute and/or other bast natural fibers to replace fiberglass in thermoset structural composites. This concept involves an approach to A) solve the well known moisture absorption issue with natural fiber composites, and B) significantly improve the interface between fiber and matrix for enhanced mechanical performance and durability, especially under environmental conditioning. This technology will be suitable for many structural applications, ranging from bathtubs to boat hulls; from LEED's minded building & construction components to lighter weight auto body parts. Tremendous energy savings are possible with the replacement of fiberglass with bast fiber (growing plants verus melting sand). Additionally, carbon dioxide can be taken out of the atmosphere, and much of the carbon locked into permanent thermoset polymeric composite structures. The use of agricultural materials in structural applications can reduce the consumption of and dependence on petroleum and mineral based products. Presently, of the more than one billion pounds annual worldwide production of natural fiber (flax, jute, hemp, kenaf), very little is produced in the US, and none of it is utilized in large volume structural applications. Due to legal restrictions, climate and other factors, Kenaf is the natural fiber best suited for US production, and is an excellent replacement for tobacco as a cash crop. The use of kenaf fiber to replace fiberglass as reinforcement in thermoset matrix composites will enable a low-cost approach to lighter weight structural materials as well as carbon sequestration. One acre of kenaf captures as much CO2 as three acres of rain forest. Much of the captured CO2 can be permanently trapped inside thermoset composite structures. Such technology then directly addresses the USDA's societal challenge of ""Climate Change"". Additionally, the energy savings from 1) replacing fiber glass manufacture and 2) light weighting structural components used in the automotive and transportation industry, will address a second USDA societal challenge; Sustainable Energy. This work also aims to develop technology that will enable cost-effective US manufacture of materials and components derived from domestically sourced agricultural products; thus supporting ""Made in America"" type Federal initiatives."

The new high-strength and/or high-modulus polymeric fiber is to be made using cutting-edge but commercially available spinning technology and an innovative and previously unexplored set of spinning process parameters. The resulting new fiber will be comparable in performance to other high-performance fibers on the market today, but will cost significantly less. Spinning experiments will be conducted at both the laboratory/bench scale, and at the pilot line level. Experimental fiber spinning lines will be modified to enable consistent fiber manufacturing. Produced fibers will be characterized using a variety of tools (focused ion beam, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray, tensile, lateral compression, density, differential scanning calorimetry, and dynamic mechanical analysis) to understand the new mechanisms that lead to improved strength and/or stiffness. The spinning conditions which enable these mechanisms will be optimized to meet target strength and/or stiffness goals. The possibility of introducing UV-resistant additives and/or other application-specific components, and any corresponding effects on performance, will also be studied.
The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is based on achieving a performance goal for the new fibers of tenacity > 15 gf/denier and/or an initial modulus of 400 gf/denier or greater. Given the anticipated capability for low-cost high-volume production, these new fibers will have a cost approaching that of standard high tenacity industrial fibers (~ $7/lb) as compared to the typical >$20/lb for specialty high performance fibers such as aramids and high-performance polyethylene (HPPE). The new fiber products will be designed to have a performance above current high-tenacity industrial fibers (HT polyester and nylon) but below current specialty high-performance fibers (aramids, HPPE). The reduced cost for these fibers will result in lower costs over a variety of applications, which will benefit society (for example, by the greater proliferation of cut-resistant apparel and other safety/protective devices). In addition to these economic benefits, the proposed work will provide extensive characterization of nano-scale fibers that will contribute to the scientific understanding of polymeric fiber structure and behavior."

Innovations include 1) chemistry approaches to address the known problems of moisture absorption and strength retention in natural fiber composites and 2) fiber processing methods that will enable the use of standard fiber processing machines and existing SMC manufacturing equipment. The new lighter weight SMCs will find initial application in off-road farm equipment, automotive trunk floors, wheel wells and other non surface-critical components that currently use metal or heavier SMCs.

In order to confirm feasibility, the objectives of the project include data gathering, investigation of computer vision algorithms, investigation of 3D input usability issues, and a thorough technical and usability evaluation. More specifically, a data set of 3D scans of hand shapes and hand poses will be collected.

The success of the proposed technology will crucially depend on its delivery of a superior user experience, and the usability issues regarding 3D input will be carefully analyzed. Finally, a detailed technical and usability evaluation will be performed, and the commercial viability will be based on the results. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in the area of engineering design. In today's market place, the competitive capacity of an engineering firm is determined by its ability to rapidly design new products and evaluate new engineering solutions. Most engineering design firms use computer aided design software to accelerate this process. However, the productivity of CAD engineers is still bottlenecked by the user interface and the user input devices available to them. This is because many CAD tasks involve 3D manipulation, which is difficult and tedious to perform with a 2D mouse. A typical CAD user spends four to eight hours a day in CAD software. Over a million CAD users fit this profile. The proposed technology makes these users more productive by enabling them to directly manipulate virtual CAD objects with their bare hands in 3D, at their desks---a technical feat that has never before been achieved. The result is faster product and engineering design in a variety of industries including manufacturing, construction and architecture which spent $6B on CAD software in 2011.

can detect denatured collagen in histological tissue section and in vivo animal imaging. Collagen is the major
structural component of nearly all human tissues and organs, providing a sturdy and bioactive framework for
cell growth and tissue formation. Although degradation of collagen takes place during normal tissue
development and maintenance, excessive levels of collagen degradation and denaturation is intricately
involved in a wide variety of diseases including cancer, atherosclerosis, arthritis, osteoporosis, nephritis, and
fibrosis. The denatured collagen molecule is a hallmark indicator of inflammation and tissue injury in these
diseases. However, this indicator is rarely used in biomedical research, due to the lack of reagents or methods
that can readily detect it. The founders of 3Helix, Inc., Drs. Yang Li and Michael Yu, discovered a synthetic
Collagen Hybridizing Peptide (CHP), which can specifically bind to denatured collagen molecules with high
affinity: the CHP peptide is able to form a stable hybridized triple helix structure only with the unraveled
collagen strands but not with intact collagen molecules. The discovery of CHP, and its binding to denatured
collagen, has been patented, published in multiple high impact journals (PNAS, Nat. Commun., ACS Nano).
Because collagen degradation is associated with a wide range of human pathology and injury, CHPâs potential
to detect and monitor disease have drawn overwhelming interests from academics and clinicians, as well as
from industry and major reagent vendors. During the Phase I period, 3Helix developed CHP into a histology
staining reagent for research use, and successfully commercialized it in 2017. The product has been sold to
over 100 users from 11 countries including some of the leading experts from world-renowned institutes.
Despite this success, current CHP requires heating as a pre-conditioning process which complicates
histological study particularly for automated process. Such pre-conditioning is detrimental to comparative in
vivo study. Recent study suggests that dimeric form of CHP is able to detect degraded collagens that a
conventional monomeric CHP cannot detect due to improved affinity made possible by mutivalency. In the
Phase II period of the SBIR grant, 3Helix plans to make significant improvement to the current peptide design
in order to make CHP easier to use in vitro without heat treatment, but more importantly to develop a first-of-
its-kind near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) probe for in vivo animal imaging. The new design, which is based on
solid preliminary study, involves the dimeric CHP structure comprised of non-self-trimerizing peptide sequence.
In addition to developing the new probe and demonstrating its use in disease detection and monitoring for in
vitro and in vivo use, 3Helix will also produce optimized protocols for i) in vitro assay of degraded collagen in
tissue section as well as for ii) in vivo imaging of mouse disease model. The successful outcome of this project
will open new avenues in basic research, drug development, and medical diagnosis for over 30 different types
of human diseases, including cancer, fibrosis, cardiovascular disease, and arthritis.Project Narrative_3Helix Inc.
Although degraded collagens are found in tissues with a wide range of human pathology, they are rarely used
as biomarker for disease due to the lack of specific molecular probes. 3Helix proposes to develop a new
imaging agent for denatured collagen which can be used for tissue staining and in vivo animal imaging in labs
and clinics that investigate disease with prominent collagen remodeling activity such as cancer, fibrosis, and
arthritis."

Existing diagnostic systems require 2-6 days to identify the bacteria, which delays treatment using appropriate antibiotics. Sepsis, which is often caused by a bacterial infection, contributes to up to half of all hospital deaths in the US largely due to complications arising from delays or inappropriate treatment (which is mainly because of lack of information regarding the infection-causing bacteria). It is the most expensive hospital-treated condition in the United States ? representing $20.3 billion in healthcare costs. The proposed system aims to sharply reduce the time to provide information needed by physicians, enabling them to initiate treatment using the appropriate antibiotic rapidly. This is expected to lead to significant reductions in costs, complications, and mortality. Further, by eliminating the need for culturing, new insights into bacterial behavior can be acquired contributing to additional fundamental knowledge of bacteria. This knowledge will aid antibiotic discovery efforts, improve understanding of mechanisms of drug resistance, support new biomanufacturing processes through faster detection of bacterial contamination of pharmaceutical products and foods, and characterization of the microbiome. The challenges of rapid bacterial identification are primarily in two areas ? sample preparation, that eliminates the need for culturing, and multiplex identification, to cover the diverse range of bacterial species capable of causing infection. The proposed work is based on leveraging the differential response between bacteria and the cells in a sample matrix to selectively break down the sample matrix, but not bacteria, such that the largest lysis debris is smaller than intact bacteria. The debris is subsequently separated from intact bacteria using a size-based technique enabling rapid isolation of a broad range of bacteria directly from the sample. A novel Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy system is then used to identify the isolated bacteria at clinically relevant concentrations. No bacteria-specific reagents are employed. The proposed Phase I work addresses the highest risk technical hurdles in the process. Isolating and detecting low concentration of bacteria directly from blood is accomplished through the three objectives of this project that optimize the purification and bacterial recovery from the sample, identification accuracy, and performance of the integrated system relative to the traditional culturing-based method.

This nano-biosensor has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Many patients who experience chest pain, an early symptom of a heart attack (myocardial infarction, MI), are first seen by EMS (emergency medical services) and are transported to a hospital in an ambulance. EMS are equipped with electrocardiogram (EKG) devices, but approximately 40% of all heart attacks cannot be diagnosed with an EKG alone. This leads to longer wait times for a definitive diagnosis, causes difficulty for patient transport decisions, delays treatment for those experiencing a true MI, and causes unnecessary hospital admissions for patients who are later found not to have had a heart attack. Blood-based biomarker assays, which are currently not performed in a prehospital setting, are needed to reach a conclusive diagnosis for all heart attack types. A portable device to monitor troponin T in a prehospital setting would result in faster treatment via improved diagnosis, better routing of patients to appropriate medical centers, and a decrease in unnecessary hospital stays. The cardiac biomarker market, including troponin, is expected to grow to $9.9 billion by 2022. The innovation of the proposed technology lies in the metal nanostructures on the diagnostic chip. These nanostructures allow proteins to be delivered to the sensing area and detected in a high sensitivity manner, while excluding larger debris, such as blood cells. The proposed work will leverage optical techniques for real-time label-free detection of protein biomarkers at the nanostructured chip. The current method for manufacturing the detection chips is slow and uneconomical. This Phase I work will address the high-risk, high-reward technical challenges by creating a low-cost, high-throughput fabrication method to mass manufacture nanostructured chips with reproducible optical properties. Additionally, this Phase I work seeks to validate blood sample delivery to the sensing area and troponin T detection in blood using an integrated microfluidic device. The selectivity and specificity requirements will be addressed by attachment of custom DNA molecules to the sensing area. These pieces of DNA are designed to bind in a highly specific manner to troponin T only. The outcomes of this Phase I project will establish the scientific and technical foundations necessary to move into a Phase II project by developing a low cost and easy to use point-of-care device suitable for rapid prehospital diagnosis of heart attacks.

The objective of this project is to extend the deployment period by capturing energy extracted from the motion of the instrumentation platform, and to improve scientific data collection by powering an anti-biofouling device designed to keep the instrumentation clear of biological growth. These systems must be cost effective, yet still survive in the harsh ocean environment. The small business worked with a research institution on a Phase I feasibility investigation. The detailed analyses completed in Phase I will be applied to the building and testing of prototype hardware in Phase II. These prototypes will undergo lab testing to verify operation and make improvements. The prototypes will then be deployed at sea for operational testing. Lessons learned from the sea testing will be captured as design improvements. The analyses conducted during Phase I demonstrated that significant energy is present in an oscillating buoy platform, energy that a buoy-mounted Wave Energy Converter (WEC) can use to power a light- emitting diode (LED)-based illuminator emitting in the sub-300nm ultraviolet spectral region. This LED was demonstrated to effectively prevent bio-fouling growth on optical window materials used in oceanography. This combination has the potential to provide a complementary source of renewable energy to charge batteries on a buoy when direct sunlight and wind are unavailable, as well as to power the anti-biofouling system directly to prevent biological growth. During lab testing, power generation will be quantified on a first-article prototype to be tested on a buoy motion simulator. Buoy motion testing results will be applied to a second version design. In order to simulate the ocean environment, the WEC, battery, and LED housings will be pressure tested at the research institution. Ultimately, the full system will be installed on an oceanographic mooring for at-sea testing. While deployed, the systems will be monitored and WEC performance will be analyzed based on transmitted engineering data. Complete system operation will be verified. Any necessary updates to the WEC control algorithm will be made after the deployment. The anti-biofouling unit will be mounted on a test conductivity sensor, and operation will be verified after deployment. Upon recovery, at-sea performance of the WEC and anti-biofouling system will be analyzed, evaluated, and updated based on lessons learned. The WEC and anti-biofouling systems will reduce operating costs by extending oceanographic instrumentation deployment periods with power generation and improved data collection."

These expensive voyages can cost several tens of thousands of dollars per day. Solar and wind power can recharge batteries, but harvested power is limited and each source has shortcomings. Wave energy operates when the sun does not shine and could provide additional power, but the few commercial systems available generally cost far too much for oceanography applications. Furthermore, even when sufficient power is available, growth of unwanted organisms (biofouling) on oceanographic sensors still necessitates expensive ship voyages to replace sensors on buoys. The company has designed a compact, low-power and relatively inexpensive wave energy converter to provide power for a variety of marine applications. This device can also power ultraviolet light-emitting diodes to inhibit biofouling on sensors. The marine research institute partner operates arrays of offshore buoys. In order to function for longer periods of time between ship visits, these buoys will need both additional power and inhibition of biofouling. The company and its partner will work together to adapt the wave energy converter technology to operate on buoys in an existing array. The Company will also develop an ultraviolet source to prevent biofouling on the marine research institute partnerâs sensors. Phase I work will establish feasibility, mechanical design of the new wave energy converter, and optical and electrical design of the ultraviolet source. While the two systems will be designed to work together, the wave energy converter and anti-biofouling source will each be able to operate without the other. During Phase I, the company will work with marine buoy engineering experts at the marine research institute partner to develop and optimize a model for wave energy conversion based on real-time motion data from existing buoys and prior conversion efficiency measurements made on the companyâs prototype. Drawing on deep experience in light emitting diodes, including for disinfection, the company will build ultraviolet source modules and run experiments in a lab and at a dock to determine operating parameters (wavelength, optical power density and duty cycle) required to prevent biofouling in a cost- effective manner. An electrical engineering consultant with a strong background in control systems will develop a block diagram for optimal power extraction from the wave energy converter, as well as design anti-biofouling source electronics. The marine research institute partner needs to prevent biofouling on its 600 sensors that are deployed down to 200 m depth. Other oceanography buoys are expected to produce a market at least an order of magnitude larger. More generally, a small, cost-effective wave energy converter could be used in a wide range of marine applications, including aquaculture, aids to navigation, offshore wind environmental monitoring, defense and security, environmental monitoring, communications, and other areas of oceanography and meteorology. Market Watch predicts that the powered data buoy market will reach over 45,000 units globally by 2022. This wave energy converter technology can be scaled up to higher powers as well, opening further opportunities."

Although vaccinations for the prevention of cervical cancer have been developed, the current vaccine has a high cost, targets only two-thirds of HPV strains, and is effective only when administered prior to HPV infection. In the U.S. alone, 1.2 million cases of low-grade CIN and 0.2-0.3 million casesof high-grade CIN are diagnosed annually; yet, no FDA- approved drug therapies are available for its treatment. For women diagnosed with low-grade CIN, the standard approach is  watchful waiting;  women with high-grade CIN are treated with the loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). Despite this treatment, a significant recurrence rate of high-grade CIN occurs. What is needed is a medical treatment option for resolving these lesions during the early stages of CIN. Project Goal and Technological Innovation. This project will develop continuous-release implants, containing a natural compound - specifically withaferin A - for the prophylactic treatment of high-risk patients with cervical cancer and other cervical pathologies. The implant to be used at the target site, promises a significant advance in cancer prevention and treatment. Natural compounds administered orally are often accompanied by limited bioavailability while chemotherapeutics administered intravenously result in undesirable large spikes in the blood. The development of polymeric implants to provide continuous delivery of therapeutic agents directly to the target site would substantially lower its effective dose, and minimize toxicity concerns generally associated with high oral and i.v. doses. The main objective of this project is to optimize polymeric implants ( cervical inserts ) for continuous ( 24/7 ) release of withaferin A at the target site (ie., the cervix) using a large animal model, the goat. The studies described represent the necessary pre-clinical efforts to examine potential toxicity and rate of release of withaferin A from the cervical implants. In addition, the concept of continuous local delivery of cancer chemopreventives is a novel and innovative concept that has the potential to revolutionize the clinical management of high-risk individuals. The new, patient-friendly device would be an economic treatment. Furthermore, prophylactic treatment with natural compounds delivered locally may obviate the need for LEEP.The implant delivery device is currently under a pending patent, with one of the PIs (Dr. Gupta) as the inventor. Hypothesis and Specific Aims. We hypothesize that withaferin A, a triterpenoid, which has no known toxicity and has significant antiproliferative and anti-viral activities against human cervical cancer cells in vitro and in viv, when embedded in polymeric implants, will be released continuously at the target site for extended periods, and that no tissue or systemic toxicity associated with either the drug or the polymeric materials will be produced. The specific aims are to (1) optimize the formulation of polymeric cervical inserts and determine rate of drug release in vitro; and (2) using a large animal (goat) model, determine, the rate of drugrelease from cervical inserts, any systemic and tissue toxicity, and the levels of the drug in plasma, and local, surrounding and distal tissues. Future efforts will involve examining still longer-term drug release and potential longer-term or delayed toxicity, obtaining FDA approval, and conducting a clinical trial with cervical dysplasia patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this research project is to develop polymeric cervical implants ( cervical inserts ) that can providecontinuous release of compounds with therapeutic activity against cervical pre-cancer and cancer directly to the target site. When placed in the cervix these implants can deliver drugs continuously ( 24/7 ) for months, potentially obviate the need for electrosurgical excision of pre-cancerous lesions, and ultimately prevent the development of cervical cancer. This prophylactic treatment will benefit hundreds of thousands of women in the United States alone, who otherwise would require a surgical procedure. Worldwide, the benefits of this approach will be far greater, because cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women after breast cancer. In this pilot project, we will optimize cervical inserts and assess any potential toxicity associatedwith both the implant materials and with a naturally-occurring compound (withaferin A) with potent anticancer activity against cervical pre-cancer/cancer, using a large animal (goat) model."

Heart failure affects more than five million Americans and increases therisk of sudden death. This application sets out to develop a simple, inexpensive blood test to help predict sudden death risk that may prevent unnecessary ICD implants and help screen moderate risk populations now not treated. One advantage of this test isthat it reflects the state of cardiac Na+ channels (SCN5a). Modulation of these channels is already known to cause arrhythmias such as Brugada Syndrome when too little current is present and Long QT syndrome when too much current is present. Recently, wereported three SCN5a mRNA alternative splicing variants are upregulated in human HF tissue. These variants encoded nonfunctional cardiac Na+ channels. Our preliminary data show that white blood cells (WBCs) have abnormal Na+ channel mRNA splicing, that WBCsplicing is highly correlated with that in heart, and that HF patients have reduced full length Na+ channel and increased variants in their heart and blood when compared to control patients. Hypothesis. Since SCN5A is the main channel generating current for electrical propagation in heart muscle and mutations in this channel are known to cause arrhythmic sudden death, we hypothesize that these truncated mRNAs for the Na+ channel will contribute to arrhythmic risk in HF, and by quantifying their presence inblood, it will be possibl to develop a blood test that would help predict sudden death risk in HF patients. Product. This phase I application will establish the feasibility of a proprietary blood test to predict arrhythmi risk in HF patients. If successful, this test would be unique, since no other blood tests exist for this purpose. Specific aim 1: To determine if altered WBC Na+ channel mRNA variant abundances are associated with an elevated likelihood of sudden death risk as measured by appropriate discharge in patients with ICDs. Plans for Phase II. Phase II would be a prospective, multisite examination of the same relationship and product prototype development. Commercial Application. Initially, ROS' novel blood test will be sought by hospitals (5,000in the US) and physicians for use in over 500,000 patients who are diagnosed with HF annually in order to prevent unnecessary ICD implants. A reduction in the number of ICD implantations would save ~ 150 million annually in the US healthcare system.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ROS Technologies, Inc. is a medical diagnostics company developing a blood test to predict sudden death risk in patients with heart failure. Heart failure occurs in more than 550,000 US citizens each year, but there are no simple, reliable ways of predicting who is at highest risk for sudden cardiac death and who will benefit from an implanted defibrillator. This Phase I STTR application sets out to establish the feasibility of a blood test o predict sudden death risk and thereby help direct more than 1 billion/year in medical expenses to those most likely to benefit."

ngful reports requires complex software and information systems which do not yet exist. The software and information technologies we propose to develop will contribute to the understanding of individual genetic variation and it application for diagnostics,
 determining disease prognosis and for selecting individualized treatment programs. Potential application of computationally structured knowledge and individual genome data can be applied across every therapeutic area and branch of medicine; this work comp
lements the Biomedical Information Science and Technology Initiative (BISTI) and strongly supports the National Institutes of Health RoadMap objectives."

This platform will overcome the following limitations inherent in current microarray systems: (1) current systems typically do notaddress all types of array data, (2) current systems do not record the context of the samples, which hinders scientific and statistically relevant queries of the data, and (3) current systems do not track computational processes, which hampers dataanalysis. In order to take advantage of microarrays and manage the massive volume of data produced by them, scientists must have bioinformatics platforms like the one we are developing for this research. We propose to couple a highly sophisticatedLaboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to a pioneering analysis information management system (AIMS) that executes computational processes and interfaces with external bioinformatics tools as well as databases. The integration of LIMS and AIMSwill produce dramatic benefits for researchers throughout the DOD&#039;s Defense Technology Area Plan in Infectious Diseases of Military Importance by improving research quality and decreasing time to biological discovery. Some of the technologies used in thisresearch were developed by 3rd Millennium for an Advanced Technology Program (ATP) grant (see Related Work section).The bioinformatics platform we are developing will benefit both the government and the private sector in drug development, toxicologystudies, and disease treatment by improving research quality and decreasing time to biological discovery. For example, the platform will aid disease treatment by facilitating the development of gene expression molecular phenotype classifiers for diseasestates. These classifiers can be used to match drugs to the diseases against which they will be the most effective. The search engine we implemented in Phase 1 of the research and will develop further in Phase 2 can aid in the construction of suchclassifiers. The sophisticated engine can also help in drug development by identifying genes that are suitable drugable targets and have altered expression profiles in the disease state relative to the healthy state. Also, databases of expression profileslike the one we implemented in Phase 1 are already being used in drug toxicology studies to determine if candidate drugs have molecular phenotypes that are known to be toxic. Expression profile databases have also shown utility in identifying the functionof genes that lack annotations. This is especially helpful for researchers who are working with organisms that have poorly annotated genomes like the disease causing agents Plasmodium falciparum (malaria) and Bacillus anthracis (anthrax). In order torealize the full potential of functional genomic technologies like microarrays, researchers throughout the DOD and private sector need bioinformatics platforms like the one we successfully developed for Phase 1 of the research and will develop further inPhase 2. Finally, technologies developed for this proposal will also be extremely effective for the management and analysis of other functional genomic data such as proteomic and metabolic data."

The method uses two consecutive steps: high temperature cure resin infusion and room temperature cure resin infusion into the same skin preform via high temperature and room temperature VARTM processes respectively. The 3D braided preforms are attached to the skin preform and co-infused in vacuum bag at room temperature. The skin preform can be a hybrid of PAN-based and pitch-based carbon fibers; the former type fiber is used for the inner part and the latter type faces elevated temperatures. Special attention is paid to the interface between two distinct matrix materials occupying different parts of the skin and to the interfaces between skin and stiffener (Pi-joint). Special methods of interface strength enhancement using sprayed carbon nanotubes and creating porous regions will be studied. Non-destructive evaluation and initial mechanical testing will be conducted. BENEFIT: The proposed out-of-autoclave manufacturing approach will enable production of complex unitary composite structures suitable for future supersonic transport applications. This will be achieved by a relatively simple process and equipment, with minimal labor involvement and at significantly reduced manufacturing cost. The use of thick self-sustained integrally woven and braided 3D fabric preforms is a key: it will completely eliminate the steps of stitching multiple layers of thin fabrics for the skin and stiffeners, Pi-joints, frames, etc. By use of different carbon fiber types and combining high temperature and room temperature cure resins in the same preform, it will become possible to optimize the whole complex of thermo-mechanical properties of this new type of unitary composite structures."

BENEFIT: Aerospace industry may be primarily interested in using these novel CNT reinforced prepregs and composite laminates for unique structures which require low weight and high strength combined with high electrical and/or high thermal conductivity. Immediate applications may include light-weight composite structures for housing various aircraft electronic systems. Currently available composite laminates are not applicable due to their low through-thickness thermal and electrical conductivities. In the proposed CNT prepregs and laminates, with long CNTs extending through the whole ply thickness, these properties will be elevated to a much higher level, at least an order of magnitude. The development of integrated manufacturing cycle for these materials and their structural components will enable to supplying them in large volumes for the next generation unmanned aircraft and surveillance platform structures, as well as for the future civil transport systems."

To prevent damage to the expensive blade protective sheaths or coatings are applied to the leading edge of the rotor blades. A 3-D woven composite sheath with high thermal conductivity fibers running through the thickness can offer the best qualities of both metal sheaths and elastomer coatings. Infused with an elastomer matrix, it will achieve excellent sand erosion resistance. Based on a 3-D fiber architecture, it will provide excellent resistance to both impact damage and rain erosion. High conductivity graphite fibers running through the thickness of the composite will mimic the thermal conductivity of the metal sheaths. In this Phase I effort, 3TEX and its partner CCM-UD will produce a 3-D fiber architecture composite rotor sheath prototype. 3TEX will design a 3-D woven preform that incorporates several functions, including impact resistance, local stiffening, and through thickness thermal conductivity. CCM-UD will infuse the preform using VARTM infusion techniques that can include local tailoring of the resin for impact or strength or high temperature. Prototype sheaths will demonstrate the production processes while material coupon testing will determine rain erosion, sand erosion, and impact resistance, as well as thermal conductivity.BENEFITS: Composite rotor sheathes based on 3-D fiber architecture should offer the best performance attributes of both elastomer coatings and metal sheathes. While maintaining the anti-icing functionality of metal sheaths, the 3-D composite rotor sheathes will provide longer component life. The longer component life should not come at a high component cost. The 3-D fiber performing process is sufficiently economical to compete in the E-glass boat hull market, while the VARTM infusion processes reduce tooling costs and speed the part production, so the part prices themselves should be competitive with existing sheaths. However, increasing the time between replacement of the sheaths immediately translates to reduced maintenance costs and higher helicopter readiness levels for the Navy.  The payload and range of Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft, such as helicopters, are highly sensitive to aircraft weight. The 3-D composite rotor sheathes will weigh significantly less than the current metal sheathes. Thus, this new technology sheath will increase the range and payload of every fleet helicopter currently using metal sheaths, such as the V-22. The proposed effort then will offer reduced maintenance costs and increased VTOL range and payload."

Pulsed CVI with an improved out-gas control system will both form a gradient interphase that reduces the CTE mismatch induced internal loads between fiber and matrix and provide a more perfect microstructure while improving processing speed. CMC test articles will be compared to previous work on molecular level thermal modeling for Phase I. Phase II will deliver optimized design and manufacturing processes capable of making impact tolerant, long fatigue life, high temperature CMC&#039;s."

The overall goal of this research program is to develop a novel magnetic resonance (MR) image analysis method that can distinguish between malignant and benign lung nodules in patients who are undergoing diagnostic evaluation for lung cancer. 3TP Imaging Sciences has developed MR image analysis software that can be used to characterize the status of small tumors by analyzing the pharmacokinetics of contrast agent that has been introduced into target tissues. The key to this approach is the use of computational modeling to identify three time points (hence, 3TP) that best discriminate between malignant and normal or benign tissue. Two products have been cleared by the FDA and commercialized to aid in the diagnosis of breast cancer and prostate cancer. This proposal, in response to PA-04-094, proposes a strategy to optimize this novel in vivo image enhancement method to help diagnose lung cancer. The objective of this Fast-Track Phase I project is to overcome the technical hurdles to establishing the feasibility of the 3TP approach for lung cancer. Aim 1 will establish an electronic work environment for data acquisition, analysis and sharing between the collaborative sites. Aim 2 will optimize a motion correction algorithm to reduce respiratory artifacts during the scanning process. Aim 3 will optimize data acquisition parameters for Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) of the lung. Aim 4 will identify three time points that best characterize the status of previously identified pulmonary nodules in patients who are under- going surgical resection. Image analysis results will be compared with the ""gold standard"" for diagnosis of lung cancer: surgical histopathology. Successful completion of this Phase I study will lead to a Phase II study, described in the accompanying proposal, to validate the optimized MR image analysis platform with a multi-site clinical study in patients who have been scheduled for surgical resection of suspicious lung nodules. Relevance: Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer, but early detection is problematic because the current radiographic screening methods are unreliable for very small tumors and require exposure to ionizing radiation. Surgical follow-up of suspicious lung nodules reveals that half of the nodules are benign, which means that many patients are exposed to excess morbidity, mortality and cost from the surgery itself. Successful completion of this Fast-Track project would result in the commercialization of a robust, minimally invasive MR imaging platform to help diagnose early-stage lung cancer."

Current shop floor systems are almost entirely two-dimensional stylus-based systems that are fragile, incapable of measuring complex geometries and have high cost of ownership. A shop-floor, 3D roughness system will enable greater sampling, faster process feedback and improved time-to-results which will enhance competitiveness across a wide range of U.S. industries including medical devices, aerospace, transportation, and defense. All precision machined components call out surface roughness or texture, yet achieving consistent results with existing contact gauges is difficult and time consuming. It is believed that a shop floor, non-contact roughness measurement device could gain significant market share, with sales upwards of $50M/year upon proving correlation with existing trusted laboratory techniques. Also, trusted, readily available roughness information on almost any machined surface will enable enhanced quality, lifetime, and aesthetics for precision manufacturers, improving competitiveness and reducing waste across a variety of industries. The intellectual merit of this project is due to its leveraging of recent advances in a variety of fields including additive manufacturing, precision optics, microprocessing, image sensors and interferometric algorithms to achieve nm-scale vertical resolution in a vibration-immune device deployable in manufacturing environments. The closest similar product has vertical resolution more than 100X worse than is proposed here and the proposed performance goals present significant challenges to achieve both high resolution and hand-held capability. A successful Phase 1 will prove that significant synergies between advances in various fields can be combined to significantly advance performance over prior generation products. Also, if successful, manufacturers will have access to a far greater range of process control parameters on more types of surfaces and will be able to improve quality and yield significantly via faster and more accurate feedback into their production cycle. The output of this Phase 1 program will be a first article device that can be brought to customers for demonstration in a shop floor environment. The device will correlate with existing techniques while solving many key issues, such as alignment difficulty, scratching surfaces via a contact measurement, and lack of three-dimensional surface information."

Many modern manufactured parts, such as turbine blades, drive shafts, orthopedics, and various additive manufactured components require in-situ metrology with high resolution for accurate characterization during manufacturing and/or maintenance operations. Current high-resolution surface measurement systems are slow, vibration-sensitive and laboratory-based and thus are impractical for everyday use by manufacturing technicians. Meanwhile, shop-floor inspection is often only visual, and thus qualitative rather than quantitative, leading both to rejections of acceptable components as well as potential acceptance of failing ones. The absence of high-precision, in-situ metrology has hindered manufacturers from applying real-time data analysis and closed-loop process controls that can improve yields and reduce manufacturing costs. This research program will yield a hand-held, easy-to-use, robust, and quantitative shop-floor measurement system, allowing manufacturers to improve lifetimes, performance, and yield as they rapidly assess the features under test and feed the results back to improve process control. During Phase I, a breadboard system was designed and implemented using a polarization-based fringe projection method and micropolarizer phase-mask technology to achieve vibration insensitive measurement in a compact package. This Phase II program leverages that research to design a video-rate, compact, robust and portable system for handheld surface measurements in shop-floor environments. This will first involve improvements to measurement resolution with an improved optical design and new self-calibrating measurement modes; new optical elements will lower noise artifacts caused by imperfections in the earlier design and to reduce system size. Once performance of the new design is verified, an ergonomic, compact, robust, wireless housing for the instrument must be created to enable shop-floor use; the system must handle drops of over one meter onto concrete, have useful battery life for extended field operations, be light enough to not fatigue users and have intuitive controls and feedback. A final, critically important development effort will create automated software routines for measurement, analysis, and system diagnostics to enable adoption by unskilled personnel in manufacturing environments. Lastly, extensive applications testing in the field will allow optimization of the system to handle a wide range of potential use cases and environments."

Polarimetric enhanced image data has been shown to be highly beneficial for both defense and commercial applications including: target discrimination, mine detection, and remote material identification; however, compact, solid-state solutions do not currently exist in the SWIR owing to the difficulty of fabricating such a device. Our approach is to modify our existing process for fabricating visible sensors utilizing direct bonding of micro-polarizer arrays (MPA)s to a focal plane array (FPA), in order to work with an InGaAs FPA. Previous attempts at this by others found severe crosstalk and poor robustness. 4D plans to address these issues by working with FPA manufacturers to obtain suitable back-thinned FPAs, utilize our proprietary MPA precision alignment system, and knowledge of advanced packaging/bonding methods. The Phase I effort will validate the polarimetric performance between the MPA and FPA.

The broader impact of this project will be to improve yield, performance, safety, and lifetime of components in a wide range of critical U.S. industries including automotive, aerospace, and medical devices. For example, minor surface imperfections on edges or in other critical areas can have a dramatic effect on performance of components such as turbine blades, cutting tools, or other high-stress elements. In the turbine industry, during maintenance inspections, wear scars or corrosion pits that can lead to catastrophic failures must be quantified to ensure only necessary repairs and replacements are performed; current inspection technologies lead to high rejection rates of good parts since lack of good quantification necessitates conservatism in part rejection. This high-precision, portable, shop-floor gage will greatly enhance quantification of such features, leading to enhanced competitiveness across multiple critical U.S. manufacturing industries that employ a wide range of processing technologies. The total available market for such an instrument is estimated to be greater than $45 million annually in the initially identified application spaces. The intellectual merit of this project is the demonstration of a novel instantaneous whole-field optical method for measuring rough surfaces with micron resolution and centimeter field of view. Instantaneous whole-field acquisition enables high-resolution measurements to be made in environments not possible with current technology. Benefits of this technology range from increased manufacturing capability in aerospace (for example, production of turbine blades with improved efficiency), to fields such as medical imaging where motion and vibration are intrinsic. The research objectives for this program are to develop and/or demonstrate feasibility of several key components: an efficient method of generating polarization-based fringe patterns to enable instantaneous measurement, a state-of-the-art light source, compact optics capable of high-efficiency illumination and large-area imaging, and robust data processing techniques. Extensive modeling and experimentation will be combined to ensure success of each of the technical objectives. Once key components are developed, a breadboard system will be built and comprehensively tested against a variety of critical metrology goals. At the end of this Phase I effort, the anticipated outcome will be a working breadboard capable of vibration-immune, three-dimensional surface metrology with micron-level lateral and vertical resolution, applicable to a wide range of precision machined surfaces."

In applications such as medical implants and precision automotive components, longevity is critically affected by surface finish owing to friction and wear. Additionally, the measurement of nanostructures is important in the fields of hard disk drive components, MEMS, flat-panel displays, and semiconductor chips to provide feedback to improve fabrication processes and tools. Instruments that directly measure surface roughness in-situ in the presence of vibration, and over a large area, are not readily available. The proposed instrument will allow rapid measurement over a large scale in manufacturing environments enabling quick optimization of the fabrication process, minimization of productions costs, and development of new surface fabrication processes."

This distortion can adversely affect the U.S. ArmyÃ¢â¬â¢s ability to identify and target objects at long-range. In addition, advanced imaging systems can also be limited by atmospheric distortion rather than sensor technology. Accordingly, it will be necessary to restore image information in order to take full advantage of next-generation sensors. 4-D Imaging has developed and optimized a patent-pending algorithm that is specifically designed to suppress atmospheric turbulence in video. The algorithm uses adaptive multigrid control grid interpolation to estimate a dense displacement vector field based on the characteristics of atmospheric distortion present in an image sequence. The displacement field is then used as part of a distortion compensation process that preserves genuine motion, such as that of objects moving in front of a stationary background. 4-D Imaging proposes to use this algorithm in the development of a compact real-time video restoration processor that can be easily incorporated into existing imaging systems."

Over 600,000 total knee replacement procedures are performed annually, comprising 8% of all Medicare spending. Total hospital charges for this procedure approached $40 billion for 2012. The revision rates for this procedure are significant: 10% at 10 years and 20% at 20 years. Considering the aging population of the United States, the number of total knee replacements and revisions are steadily increasing and the majority of these will be completed under Medicare coverage. The primary cause for revision surgery is loosening of the implants. This innovation aims to develop an anchoring method for implantable orthopedic devices that will reduce the total number of revision procedures performed by creating a more stable interface between the bone and the device, and therefore enhance the scientific and technological understanding of orthopedic implants in general. The proposed project is a device that utilizes structural engineering principles such as load transfer and truss design to improve osteo-incorporation of a total knee replacement implant; such a device is likely to be more efficacious than current designs. Currently available systems suffer from significant revision rates after being implanted only a short while. With younger patients receiving these implants, devices need to be developed that will give the mobility and quality of life required by these patients. The novel web structure fixing the tibial tray of a total knee replacement into the bone should provide improved initial fixation, reduce micro-motion, and eliminate aseptic loosening, all of which contribute towards a reduced revision rate and improved patient comfort. After using the information gained from the Phase I SBIR investigation to inform computational models, the design of this device will be finalized. The device will then be subjected to rigorous mechanical testing to investigate its performance in vivo, while simultaneously serving to satisfy the testing requirements mandatory for FDA approval."

This technology utilizes engineering principles such as load transfer and truss design to improve bone integration with a Total Knee Replacement (TKR) implant. Additive layer manufacturing technology, or computer aided fused titanium rapid prototyping, can be used to produce an innovative TKR implant that incorporates innovative web truss geometries for the bone interface component. It is anticipated that the web structure will provide improved initial fixation, reduce micro motion, and eliminate aseptic loosening. This project is designed to further optimize and measure the operating parameters and durability of the device through mechanical testing outlined in the FDA'S Guidance Document for TKR implants. Experiments will include fatigue testing, constraint testing, contact area testing, kinematic modeling and fixation testing. It is anticipated that this device design will represent a significant advancement in knee replacement technology that is substantially more stable and resistant to failure as compared to existing devices. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project are evident in that Knee Arthritis is a debilitating condition that leads to over 600,000 TKR?s per year. The TKR currently represents approximately 8% of all Medicare spending. Total hospital charges for this procedure are expected to approach $40 billion by 2012. Revision rates for TKR's are significant; 10% at 10 years and 20% at 20 years. Moreover, with an aging population, the number of TKR's and revisions is steadily increasing; of which, a majority will be completed under Medicare coverage. This project will accelerate production of an innovative device that employs state-of-the-art manufacturing processes and structural engineering design principles to substantially improve the bone/TKR implant interface. The design of the device has been optimized to address the problems associated with initial and long-term fixation and could thereby reduce or eliminate the need for revision procedures. This would benefit the healthcare economy and the quality of life for those that require knee replacement therapy. Furthermore, this project is part of an educational initiative that includes researchers at Texas A & M University that are employing this technology in providing unique educational experiences for graduate students in advancing engineering principles in medical device design."

Current methods produce only retrospective static models which, due to peculiarities of the higher education recruitment cycle, require at least a one-year lag between data acquisition and application to new prospects. As a result, data mining techniques have gained only limited popularity in college recruiting. The approach proposed here employs a proprietary adaptive modeling engine (AME) to leverage real-time transactional data from a CRM system and dynamically update scoring algorithms to predict outcomes. AME relies on a logical interface and unified dimensional data model to extract analyzable record-sets accurately representing the state of underlying transactional data at any time-slice within the system's effective-dated range. The integration of these key technologies allow relationship patterns to be identified in the recruitment process as they occur and scoring algorithms to dynamically adapt to changing patterns within a single recruitment cycle.
It is believed that the changing demographics of college-going students will present a number of significant obstacles to the traditional college business model and could jeopardize the future financial health of many higher education providers in this county. The decade-long trend of yearly increases in demand, as represented by the number of new students entering college, comes to an end in 2009. In stark contrast to the 24% growth the market has experienced over the past decade, future enrollment numbers will remain stagnant overall, and in many localities college enrollment will actually decline. Furthermore, dramatic shifts are coming in the geodemographic, ethnic, and cultural mix of high school graduates that feed the higher education market. As competition for students increases dramatically in the face of rising attendance costs, dwindling endowments, changing demographics, and a decline in college-bound students, each college's ability to survive, much less prosper, will depend directly on its ability to identify, understand, and communicate with students in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. Those that are able to adapt this new landscape through the use of innovative tools like AME will flourish, and those who are unable to adapt will face an uncertain future of declining enrollments and financial instability."

Project Summary
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop and validate autonomously
bioluminescent induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for use in continuously data producing, reagent-free, and
real-time toxicological screening assays. These tools will address the National Institute of Environmental Health
Sciences (NIEHS) request for novel high-throughput assays to evaluate the effects of chemical compounds on
the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, as their ability to differentiate along well-defined lineage pathways
offers a powerful approach to understanding how chemical perturbations disrupt metabolic and regulatory
functions along those pathways. The autobioluminescent iPSC-based assay systems developed here will
significantly contribute towards NIEHSâs mission to âdiscover how the environment affects people in order to
promote healthier livesâ by expanding the knowledgebase of chemical exposure toxicological effects. This is
especially important given that the commercial marketplace maintains an inventory of tens of thousands of
chemicals, the majority of which have poorly understood human health impacts, and currently require animal-
based testing approaches that are expensive, time consuming, and ethically contentious to determine their
effects. As an alternative, stem cell-based assays such as those developed here can mimic human disease states
more reliably than animal models while providing valuable information towards understanding how chemical
exposures influence cancer risks, developmental defects, and other adverse health outcomes. A significant
impetus therefore exists to integrate stem cells into chemical screening programs such as Tox21 and ToxCast,
but under the mandate that they function under high-throughput conditions. While this goal is not obtainable
using existing bioluminescent reporter technologies such as firefly luciferase that must be provided with a
chemical substrate to activate its light emission responses, resulting in only marginally informative single time
point snapshots of potential toxicological interactions, 490 BioTechâs synthetic luciferase technology rather
enables reporter cells to emit light continuously and in real-time, thereby providing an uninterrupted stream of
visual data over the lifetime of the cell as it interacts and reacts to chemical perturbations. The goal of this
research effort is to develop improved assays based upon synthetic-luciferase-expressing iPSCs and validate their
ability to report the impact of chemical exposure to cellular health and development in real time. To accomplish
these goals, our specific aims will focus on assay development and optimization, validation against a chemical
subset of the Tox21 10K library, and benchmark comparisons against existing commercial assay systems.Project Narrative
Humans interact with a vast landscape of chemicals that, despite the efforts of numerous U.S. and international
multiagency sponsored programs to test for their toxic effects and ensure consumer safety, often have poorly
understood impacts on our health. Because the primary limitation preventing these agencies from better
characterizing chemical health effects is a lack of testing methods that can rapidly provide data with sufficient
informational content and direct relevance to human health impacts, 490 BioTech is creating and validating a
next-generation testing system that uses human stem cell lines capable of autonomously emitting
bioluminescent light in response to chemical exposure events. This new testing system will enable chemical
toxicity screening to occur throughout the lifetime of the cell and produce an expanded informational database
of toxicological effects with direct relevance to human health."

the lifetime of the reporter cell as it interacts with its environment and undergoes differentiationIn partnership
with the University of Tennessee Medical Centerthis proposal will expand upon these accomplishments to

Incidents of dioxins being found in the food and animal feed chain have led to numerous recalls with consequent impacts on human and animal health as well as significant economic after-effects. The aim of this study is to design an improved assay for the detection and monitoring of dioxins in food and animal feeds. Using a unique assay strategy that consists of yeast cells that emit light upon contact with dioxin chemicals, it is anticipated that a sensitive, rapid, and cost-effective assay can be developed that outperforms the current inventory of dioxin assays and transitions screening toward assay formats that can be completed in several hours rather than several days and with no animal-based testing involved. Methods to accomplish this goal will include the application of synthetic biology to bioengineer the yeast cells to respond to the dioxin chemicals, with outputs focused on determining the sensitivity, speed, and economic savings associated with the assay. Use of this new assay technology will allow for expanded testing of food and feed commodities for dioxins without consequent increases in costs. This will permit government agencies and commercial manufacturers to test a greater percentage of the food/feed supply to provide a greater probability of early dioxin detection further up the farm-to-table pathway before products are released to the public. The resulting decrease in dioxin contamination incidents will ultimately reduce public health risks and improve the safety and security of the U.S. food supply."

Zebrafish share many common anatomical, developmental, and physiological features with humans, including disease pathologies and drug metabolism effects, and serve as ideal models for understanding how drugs and other chemicals facilitate disease management as well as cause harm through unidentified side-effects. The objectives of this research effort are to express the bacterial luciferase genes in zebrafish to create autonomously bioluminescent zebrafish models capable of delineating the biological and metabolic effects of human/drug interactions. The self-generation of bioluminescence in zebrafish is anticipated to enable higher-throughput screening assays to generate data in real time, faster, and in larger quantities than previously possible, thereby accelerating the pace of new drug discovery while reducing associated costs. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be to improve pharmaceutical drug discovery and efficacy testing, and to facilitate better human and animal disease management. Small and rapidly growing zebrafish function to reduce space and maintenance requirements, thus lowering the costs associated with pharmaceutical research and new drug discovery while decreasing the industry's reliance on animals for laboratory testing. Scientific and technological understanding in the biomedical fields will be enhanced due to massively data-rich higher-throughput screening for drug action and disease therapies.

Endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs) potentially originating from plastics, pesticides, and pharmaceutical and personal care products are under scrutiny due to implications that they cause adverse health effects in humans and wildlife, including increased cancer rates, lowered sperm counts, early puberty in females, and altered functions of reproductive organs. Chemical manufacturers and importers are being mandated to test their chemicals for endocrinetoxicity effects under the auspices of the U.S. EPA Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP). With 87,000 chemicals potentially requiring testing, the battery of Tier 1 EDC screening assays have been recognized as being too slow and too costly to meetcurrent demands, and the EPA has been tasked with transitioning its EDSP program towards faster and more cost-effective screening technologies. To address this need, 490 BioTech proposes to engineer a human cell line endowed with a bacterially derived bioluminescent reporter gene construct for improved monitoring of endocrine active chemicals. The current market of bioluminescent reporter cells being applied towards EDC screening rely upon a firefly luciferase gene construct that must be provided with a substrate to activate its light emission response, resulting in only marginally informative single time point snapshots of potential toxicological interactions. Our proposed substrate-free, autobioluminescent reporter cell line will emit light continuously and in real time in response to endocrine active compounds, thus providing an uninterrupted stream of visual data over the lifetime of the reporter cell as it interacts and reacts to target chemical exposure. Further, using a human cell as the sensing platform provides more accurate and realistic information in regards to bioavailability and a chemical's true effect on individual human health. With over 500 contract laboratories performing Tier 1 screening assays at an average cost of 1,000/assay over a potential inventory of 87,00 chemicals, and with the EPA mandating the integration of faster/better/cheaper technologies into the Tier 1 screening scheme, we believe we possess a product capable of significantly impacting the chemical/drug screening market and, here in particular, advancing our understanding of endocrine active chemicals as they pertain to public health and consumer safety.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Certain hormonally active chemicals, collectively referred toas endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs), mimic or antagonize the actions of naturally occurring estrogens and are believed to result in adverse developmental, reproductive, neurological, and immune effects in both humans and wildlife. The chemical, pesticide, personal care products, plastics, and nutritional supplements industries have been tasked with screening their products for EDCs. Using a novel autobioluminescent human cell line, 490 BioTech proposes to advance current EDC screening assays with a reporter cell technology that surveys EDC activity continuously and in real time to deliver more data faster and more cost effectively for improved safeguarding of public health."

Although hydrogen is not toxic, it has a very broad flammability range (4%-74% concentration in air and 4%-94% in oxygen), leading to explosion in the presence of heat source. Thus, hydrogen monitoring is of paramount importance during the processes of hydrogen production, transportation, storage, and all kinds of hydrogen use. However, current hydrogen sensors are not delivering a real-time response, and their sensing performance degrade gradually. Moreover, their sensing responses depend on the temperature change and the deviceâs sensitivity are not quite satisfactory for long-term industrial applications. This Phase I project proposes to develop a new type of hydrogen sensors that allows continuous monitoring of hydrogen concentration or leakage in a broad range of conditions (e.g., inert conditions without presence of oxygen or ambient conditions at a wide range of hydrogen concentrations). The new sensors are based on the innovative ionic liquid (IL) electrochemical gas sensing technology. The hydrogen sensor can sensitively detect hydrogen in a real-time manner with negligible baseline drift, thus allowing continuous monitoring of hydrogen in a quantitative way and maintaining strong reliability under both nitrogen and ambient conditions. The proposed hydrogen sensor is very selective to hydrogen gas in the presence of other interference gases (e.g., oxygen, methane, carbon dioxide, and volatile organic compounds), and can work well under different environmental conditions. Furthermore, the sensor has a long lifetime due to the reversible sensing mechanism, high sensitivity, and specificity to hydrogen sensing, and the stability of the sensing materials at harsh environments. The final miniaturized sensor prototypes will be in cm scale and able to detect hydrogen existence and oxygen concentration simultaneously and quantitatively in the range of interests for industrial applications. During Phase I, we will focus on: 1) the development, fabrication, and optimization of a robust sensor prototype, and 2) the miniaturization, system integration and testing, and validation of a full-scale workable sensor prototype for potential pipeline applications. We will perform a series of experimental tests of the full-scale sensor prototypes, including specific characterization and validation under practical conditions. This Phase I project together future Phase II work will also develop a protocol for both lab and field testing, and perform device validation through field benchmark tests with gas chromatography (GC) and current commercial gas sensors. This new hydrogen sensor is expected to be operated in a wide range of working conditions including an explosive environment in Phase II tasks. With this new device, we expect to achieve a real-time sensing network platform with robust low-cost and low-power electrochemical sensors, providing future area-wide sensing instead of point detecting of current technologies."

These interfaces will allow geographically distributed individuals to interact seamlessly with each other and learn in shared 3D virtual gaming environments. The focus of this project is to develop, evaluate, and transfer teleimmersive technologies that synchronize multiple correlated and spatial audio and 3D video streams in distributed multi-site games. These technologies are required to create interfaces that will bring together learners in a novel manner and potentially transform cultural education based on digital gaming. Current multimedia technologies only fully address the synchronization of pairs of audio and 2D video streams. The objectives of the proposed work are to (i) implement site-to-site 3D multi-audio/video streams synchronization solutions through rugged prototyping and experimental validation, (ii) identify and incorporate serious gaming requirements, usability and evaluation factors into the teleimmersive interface, and, (iii) design, develop and evaluate the extension of the synchronization capabilities for multi-site, 3D multi-video/audio streams. The project builds on research conducted at the University of Illinois. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in that the project will enable the creation of a 4D teleimmersive interface that represents a paradigm shift in the manner participants can be engaged in serious gaming through real-time teleimmersion across distances. These new environments will promote cultural awareness and understanding by providing (i) real-time teleimmersive dialogue between gamers/learners separated by geography, (ii) simulated travel to other cultures, and (iii) the means for structured interactions with individuals and groups from other cultures. The proposed interface will allow participants (and any physical objects they wish to bring with them) to be immersed in a shared virtual space and interact freely with each other, easily bringing into the games the complexity of human behavior. The commercial potential lies in greatly reducing game development time and costs by replacing the programming of 3D spaces and avatar behavior with 3D live capture and recordings of individuals in virtual spaces while retaining maximum flexibility and authenticity. The lower game development costs will enable the deployment of many small individual learning-games that may otherwise simply be too costly to develop using current methods. The teleimmersive interfaces and their underlying synchronization technologies will also enable new social interactions and collaboration capabilities in the educational games that are of particular interest to girls and women."

As a result of this effort a new metal casting process has been developed; Compressed Mold Pressure (CMP) Casting process, when combined with Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) works extraordinarily well for producing complex castings and is expected to provide significant benefits for foundries and DLA interests in advanced investment casting in the future. The Hybrid combination of these two processes, CMP-Hybrid, has much unexplored capacity to achieve multiple desirable targets not obtainable by existing technology. This is attributable to the processing method which leads to unparalleled isostatic compressive mold stress during casting.

This approach is unlikely to be replaced by optical tracking techniques, but there are many instances where it is impractical (or even impossible) to attach a mechanical device to the subject. The blades of a helicopter rotot are an excellent case-in-point. While a better understanding of blade kinematics is fundamental to the design of the aircraft, it is difficult to recover three-dimensional kinematics by traditional means under operational conditions. 4D Video believes that an image-based motion measurement system can be used to quantify the rigid-body dynamics of helicopter rotor blades under operational conditions. We propose to investigate the most appropriate means for achieving this objective. Our purpose is to develop a specification which will form the foundation of an SBIR Phase II proposal to develop new hardware and software to perform the required tasks. For the purpose of the present proposal, our effort will focus on two issues: sample-rate, and the development of a customized (circular) tracking algorithm which will take maximum advantage of the predominant motions of the rotor blades.

The goal of this project is to develop an optimized MNK inhibitor for neuropathic pain treatment.
MNK is a kinase that phosphorylates eIF4E to control the translation of a distinct subset of
mRNAs. Our focus on this target for neuropathic pain is grounded in evidence that MNK-eIF4E
signaling is activated in nociceptors upon exposure to pain promoting cytokines and growth
factors as well as by peripheral nerve injury, all of which are common factors tied to intractable
neuropathic pain. Importantly, activation of this pathway in nociceptors increases their
excitability, and genetic or pharmacological inhibition of MNK signaling blocks and reverses this
hyperexcitability as well as behavioral signs of neuropathic pain. Critically, treatment of dorsal
root ganglion (DRG) neurons taken from people with neuropathic pain with MNK inhibitors leads
to reversal of nociceptor spontaneous activity, which is thought to be a key driver of neuropathic
pain in patients. MNK inhibitors have been described, but a particular class of molecules, of
which eFT508 (a clinical phase drug for cancer) is the prototype, show strong specificity for
MNK. This molecule will be our starting point for optimization of a new molecule for the
treatment of neuropathic pain. eFT508 requires optimization because MNK inhibition in the
central nervous system (CNS) may lead to depression, an unacceptable side effect for a
neuropathic pain drug. Our group, 4E Therapeutics, plans a targeted medicinal chemistry and
screening campaign directed at generating a MNK-inhibitor-based neuropathic pain treatment
with the goal of restricting its central nervous system (CNS) penetration while retaining potency,
specificity and in vivo bioavailability and efficacy. In PHASE ONE of this project compounds will
be synthesized and screened against human MNK1 and 2 to assess potency and then will
undergo in vitro ADM and pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in rats to assess plasma to brain drug
concentrations. Compounds that have favorable peripheral PK but lack blood brain barrier
(BBB) penetration will then be tested for in vivo efficacy in neuropathic pain models in rats and
compared directly to eFT508. PHASE TWO will focus on human DRG efficacy and toxicology
studies to verify choice of lead clinical candidate and backup compounds culminating with an

The proposed work combines more than a decade of independent development of MNK1/2 as a

A problem with existing digital signal processing, as applied to SDDs, is the significant presence of coincidence peaks above the x-ray background. These coincidence peaks occur with amplitudes comparable to low-concentration species. In specimens with x-ray peaks arising from two or more elemental constituents, the coincidence peaks can occupy a sizeable portion of the spectrum between the high abundance peaks, leading to false identification of elements and significant errors in quantification. NIST seeks advanced digital signal processing techniques to overcome this severe limitation to SDD application. The objective of the Phase II work is to provide NIST a prototype digital pulse processor that demonstrates an order-of-magnitude reduction in coincidence counting, at an output count rate of 500,000 cps. Our Phase I work and continuing development in anticipation of a Phase II award suggest that the requirement can be met and likely exceeded, with the additional bonus that other parts of the event stream can also be recovered instead of rejected, leading to significant improvements over current state-of-the-art pulse processing."

III-V cell development on the SiGe lattice constant is a natural direction for 4Powerâs substrate platform which already utilizes SiGe graded buffers. This strategy for optimized solar cell efficiency is fully compatible with our Si-encapsulated cell technology demonstrated in Phase I. The multijunction cell that will be developed in Phase II will incorporate both Si encapsulation and uniquely accessible optimum bandgap profiles such that high volume/low cost production of ultra-high specific power cells in a Si-compatible manufacturing environment is enabled."

The multi-core fiber, with single mode operating wavelengths of 1000nm to 1550nm, enhances emerging RFoF applications and virtually eliminates interference coupling between adjacent RF pathways. Additionally, Fiber Optic (FO) pathways are immune to external Electrical Magnetic Interference (EMI), a constant problem in electrical based RF pathways. Another advantage of RFoF networks is their phase stability. Electrical RF systems require constant attention to maintain phase-coherence due to cable sensitivities, a disadvantyage that RFoF systems do not have.

This SBIR project will have impact not only in expanding fundamental knowledge of plant utilization of water but also in contributing to agricultural productivity, an urgent and practical need for human survival, in a sustainable manner. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to commercialize the advanced water-treatment technology that could enhance plant growth, and therefore improve crop output in agricultural applications. In short, a thin layer (about 100 microns, as thin as a human hair) of interfacial water was found to exist with a slightly higher pH, net negative charge, and a tendency to exclude impurities. These findings were similar to those found by other independent research groups working with xylem cells in plants and muscle cells in animals. Several hydrogels and polymers were also found to contain interfacial water with similar properties. Initial studies regarding the practical use of the interfacial water were conducted in a plant system. On average, initial results show a rapid growth rate of around 10% to 20% improvement compared to the control group; preliminary findings that have now been confirmed to be similar amongst four different plants, namely chick pea, wheatgrass, basil, and pea shoots. This SBIR will enable continued testing and scale up the interfacial water generator to meet water demands for customer validations.

The hypothesis will be tested that slightly elevated particle energies might replace the atom mobility effects of heating and allow growth at lower temperature, which would solve a well-known phase segregation problem in InxGa1-xN as x is increased.

Fatigue and sleep disturbances, common, distressing, and debilitating symptoms of cancer and its treatment,
negatively impact physical, emotional, and social health of millions of cancer patients. Most of the 1.7 million
Americans diagnosed with cancer in 2020 will suffer cancer and treatment-related symptoms; up to 90%
receiving treatment experience fatigue; 30% may experience long-lasting fatigue. Sleep disturbances (affecting
up to 75% of patients) contribute to poor health and may exacerbate fatigue. Mounting evidence indicates that
acupressure, which is unfamiliar and infrequently used by cancer survivors, can reduce fatigue and improve
sleep. 5 Point App, Inc. is developing its first mobile health (mHealth) software, EnergyPoints, a patient
activation and educational app that offers an opportunity to mainstream acupressureâa beneficial strategy to
help cancer patients self-manage their symptoms. The EnergyPoints App will motivate and guide cancer
patients to implement daily acupressure protocols to self-manage fatigue and sleep disturbances. The app will
connect individual sleep and activity data synced from an Apple Watch/Fitbit with self-reports of symptoms,
allowing patients and clinical providers to monitor symptom response to acupressure self-treatment. The long-
term goal is to improve quality of life for cancer patients suffering from fatigue and sleep disturbances using
acupressure as a safe, universally affordable self-care technique. The team will first develop a fully functional
prototype app, validating data accuracy and debugging programming. Specific aim 1 is to confirm cancer
patients can accurately and consistently self-administer two acupressure protocols using the app. Specific aim
2 is to assess the usability of the app and the fitness tracker. Using an integrated agile, user-centered
approach, 20 patients with cancer who are experiencing fatigue will use the app to self-administer acupressure
(twice daily for 1 week) while wearing a fitness tracker. User performance video-recordings, and feedback via
talk-aloud session, debriefing, and exit interview, will be used to improve all prototype app features in sprints.
Results will provide evidence of feasibility and usability: specifically, the EnergyPoints prototype app can teach
and guide cancer patients to perform acupressure as directed, is acceptable, and can connect and accurately
share important health data from a fitness tracker. In a subsequent Phase 2 SBIR application, a clinical trial is
planned to examine efficacy of the app in improving fatigue and sleep in a sample of cancer patients.
Additionally, EnergyPoints App features will be extended by adding: 1) use of essential oils; 2) tailored
acupressure delivery; 3) clinical monitoring to integrate with cancer care; 4) social connection features, 5)
additional measures (e.g. pain, depression, activation) and 6) compatibility with other trackers (e.g. Amazon
Halo). Potential users include millions of cancer patients before and after treatment. The initial
commercialization strategy includes multiple revenue streams and marketing directed towards patients,
caregivers, practitioners, cancer centers, hospitals, medical practices, and corporate sponsors.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Cancer-related fatigue and sleep disturbances afflict millions of cancer patients. Evidence suggests the use of
specific acupressure protocols may ameliorate these under-treated and debilitating effects of cancer and
cancer therapies. In this SBIR, 5 Point App will develop and test EnergyPoints App, a multi-functional and
connected mobile app to teach, guide, and motivate potentially millions of cancer patients to practice safe,
convenient, and affordable daily acupressure for self-management of their fatigue and sleep disturbance."

Future planned capabilities, like the Advanced Tactical Data Link (ATDL), will require a significant increase in IDR, which typically requires an expensive, time-consuming retrofit of the legacy platform to install networking cables or fibers. 5-D has conceived a system, Broadband On Aircraft-multi (BOAm), leveraging commercial Power Line Communications (PLC) technology that will provide Gigabit class IDR throughput over the existing wiring in legacy aircraft. Our concept will use multiple, militarized PLC communication channels to provide significant point-to-point, or multipoint communications. This technology will provide robust, secure, and reliable communications over the currently installed complement of wiring, cables, and power lines, throughout a platform, without interfering with the original wiring function or existing systems. Our concept is expandable to utilize all available communication channels, in concert, to increase IDR throughput to over 100 Mbps (threshold) or over 1 Gbps (objective).

Although the industry harvests a large quantity of shellfish from the oceans and through aquaculture, a significant amount of waste is being generated. Shellfish waste has been a source of pollution in coastal areas; biodegradation of this waste is very slow, and accumulation of large quantities has become a major concern in the seafood processing industry. This not only creates environmental concerns, but the waste also contains valuable materials such as chitin, proteins, and calcium carbonate. The value of the waste by-products from the fishing industry has been recognized as a challenge to recover these valuable by-products. Past DOE research funding was used to develop a project aimed at developing high capacity adsorbents for the extraction of uranium from seawater using chitin produced by a Chitin IL Extraction Process (CILEP). We propose to scale this system into a continuous-flow, containerized unit based on a scaled- up process dissolution reactor that can be co-located as part of a seafood waste processing operation to yield high-value bioproducts. Local community engagement is needed to make this a reality. The CILEP biorefinery concept represents an important innovation for stimulating community partnership as an integral part of the processing of biomass into biproducts. The CILEP system will serve as a reproducible model in the community to follow for how a small-scale, modular biorefinery process can work as a powerful economic stimulus driver useful for community leaders, industry, educators, and students. The overall goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a preliminary design package for implementation of the CILEP process (in Phase II) near the shrimp shell waste process facility in Bayou la Batre, AL to build supply to help the local fishing community and an educated entrepreneurial base to develop products to drive demand. This will be achieved by 1) Completing the preliminary engineering work necessary to design an operating CILEP system meeting project design criteria at scale that is replicable for GCASC and other communities with similar seafood waste; 2) Assessing the techno-economic viability of CILEP implementation; and 3) Involving the community stakeholders in the design plan to help the community guide what costs and returns are feasible locally. The project will yield significant impacts on a local, national, and even global scale. Like the world- wide transition of the rayon industry from a high polluting process to one that is now considered green, this operation places chitin in the realm of green manufacturing. A reduced footprint benefits human health and the environment. Furthermore, the process yields a product with high commercial value for boosting economies and one which can provide unforetold medical benefits.

With decades of research towards the extraction of uranium from seawater, focus has been directed towards the selectivity of the adsorbent material, the cost of the material, and the ability of the adsorbent to be recycled. Cost analysis indicates that 47 % of the total cost of extracting uranium from seawater is directed at the cost of manufacturing the adsorbent material.1 It has recently been proven, through the use of ionic liquid technology, that chitin can be dissolved and electrospun into nanofibers directly from a shrimp shell extract in ionic liquid. 2
The ability of being able to produce a high surface area, easily functionalized, and strong material from a waste product could have significant impact on decreasing the costs of an adsorbent.  With minimal effort following, chemical surface modification can provide a natural, renewable, and highly selective adsorbent for the extraction of uranium from seawater.3Using this recently proven technique, in collaboration with Professor Robin Rogers from The University of Alabama, we intend to design and manufacture a mini pilot-scale plant for the microwave-assisted dissolution of chitin from shrimp shell waste and the subsequent electrospinning of high surface area chitin nanofibers in a continuous fashion for the extraction of uranium from seawater. With the production of this mini pilot scale plant, we could provide cheap, affordable adsorbents for increased scale seawater testing and deployment.  The success of this adsorbent could provide additional opportunities for the seafood industry with increased revenues and job creation through decreased waste disposal costs and a marketable product for sale."

The technology allows for solution blending and spinning of alginate and chitin (both known to speed wound healing, stimulate cell recovery, and be antibacterial) with therapeutic additives to produce composite fibers. This unique technology embeds the additives into the fibers during spinning, leading to slow release of the additives into the wound as the fiber absorbs water and becomes less rigid, and thus allowing the delivery of physiologically relevant doses of a therapeutic agent to the wound over an extended period of time. These fibers will a) possess the inherent properties of the biopolymers that increase wound healing and cell recovery, b) localize delivery of beneficial additives, and c) slowly release the additives over an extended period of time. In Phase I, the goals are to develop an understanding of the relationship between the relative chitin/alginate/additive composition and spinning conditions on mechanical and rheological properties (strength, elasticity, viscosity), water absorption, and additive release rates under simulated conditions as needed for the diabetic skin ulcer markets. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the potential to reduce the duration (by ~40%) and cost (by 20-50%) of wound care treatment by developing a unique composite fiber with additives both on the surface and evenly distributed within the fiber, thereby allowing not only for extended release of the additives, but also less frequent dressing changes and decreased healing time compared to the current spray-coated fibers. The targeted skin ulcer treatment market is predicted to generate revenue of $7.4 billion by 2013, an increase caused by the rising diabetic population. A subset of this market where produced fibers are most applicable, the moist dressing treatment, achieved revenue of $315.4 million in 2008 and is expected to grow to $424.8 million by 2013. There is an urgent need for products that can improve healing rates and novel dressings incorporating innovative fibers that can be applied less frequency, last longer, and contain additives to promote healing, thus reducing patient care cost. The successful development of these specialty fibers for the diabetic ulcer market will provide scientific insight allowing for the customized production of composite fibers for other wound care and health markets."

For the production of biofuels and chemicals the aim is to cleanly fractionate biomass and to utilize the lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose individually. The current pretreatment methods are either energy intensive or cause severe degradation of the components. A more efficient pretreatment method for biomass fractionation is in great demand which requires low energy, modest conditions, and recyclable solvents. New and efficient solvents and process technologies are needed to help unlock the promise of lignocellulosic biomass, and in this regard, the field of ionic liquids (ILs) might live up to its tremendous potential as a new class of solvents by direct dissolution of the components of biomass with mild conditions. By using a selected catalyst to break the lignin-carbohydrate bonds, clean separation of the three major components is possible based on IL processes. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The immediate outcomes will be used to selectively cleave lignocellulosic bonds allowing the ready isolation of pure cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose fractions and thus overcoming one of the Grand Challenges in the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass.

poor prognosis. Current standard care for glioblastoma treatment consists of maximal surgical resection
followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Unfortunately, it hardly produces long-term control on tumor
progression. Due to the highly heterogeneous, infiltrating and recurring natures of glioblastomas,
chemotherapy plays a crucial role in clinical management of glioblastomas. However, existing chemotherapies
in brain tumor treatment are mostly disappointing, often due to poor delivery of chemotherapy agents
stemming from their low water solubility and/or inability of crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB) or blood tumor
barrier (BTB). Although nanomaterial-based drug delivery systems have shown advantages by enhancing the
delivery efficiency and improving the safety profile of therapeutics over conventional chemotherapy
formulations in treating many cancers, their development and applications in brain tumor treatment are largely
limited, because of delivery challenges in current nano-delivery systems with sizes of 10-200 nm. Supported by
the premises that: 1) ferumoxytol (FerahemeÂ®), an FDA approved iron oxide nanoparticle for treating iron
deficiency anemia, can be used for imaging brain tumor with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients,
and 2) our sub-5 nm ultrafine iron oxide nanoparticle (uIONP) can reach brain tumors in the intracranial glioma
mouse model to enhance tumors in MRI with T1 contrast, this STTR Phase I project aims to develop a new
class of drug-carrying and glioblastoma targeted IONP for delivering highly potent yet water-insoluble
chemotherapy agent SN38, the active and much more potent form of chemotherapy agent Irinotecan (CPT-11)

our patented amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol)-block-(allyl glycidyl ether) (PEG-b-AGE) coating polymer for
uIONPs to encapsulate hydrophobic SN38, which has not been used for treating brain tumors due to poor
intracranial delivery. Tri-peptide RGD with well-documented functions and safety profile is selected as the
ligand for functionalizing uIONPs to target Î±vÎ²3 integrin overexpressed in glioblastomas. In the proposed
project, we will prepare and optimize the RGD-conjugated uIONP with SN38 loading (RGD-uIONP/SN38) with
consistent physiochemical and biological properties, including SN38 loading efficiency, surface charge, density
of conjugated the targeting ligand, glioblastoma cell targeting, intracellular drug release and cytotoxicity, and
stability (Aim 1). We will then use an intracranial mouse model to investigate the blood half-life, biodistribution,
clearance, and tumor uptake and intra-tumoral distribution of developed RGD-uIONP/SN38 as well as the
stability of this platform in blood and organs in Aim 2, followed by determining the efficacy of RGD-
uIONP/SN38 in inhibiting the tumor growth based on MRI in vivo and histopathological analysis. The results
will lead to the further development of this system towards clinical translation in the Phase II project.PROJECT NARRATIVE Effectively delivering chemotherapeutics to malignant and infiltrative brain tumors

impaired insulin secretion and/or insulin resistance. Patients are subject to life-long management of their
diabetic conditions and the high risk of macro and microvascular complications. Insulin therapy is the most
effective means of lowering blood glucose for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients with complete absence
of endogenous insulin and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with progressively depleted insulin
secreting pancreatic Î²-cells and insulin resistant organs and tissue. It is also used for controlling short-term
hyperglycemia in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The current therapy is subcutaneous injection or
infusion of insulin. However, the poor patient adherence due to inconvenience and psychological insulin
resistance (PIR) to routine injection is still a major hindrance in managing diabetic patients. Furthermore, long-
term use of insulin injection can cause side effects, including lipodystrophy, iatrogenic hyperinsulinemia, and
hypoglycemia. Orally delivered insulin, on the other hand, possesses advantages in patient adherence and
therapeutic effect by mimicking the physiological path of endogenous insulin. However, the development of
oral insulin formulations has not yet been successful due to low insulin bioavailability, stemming from the
degradation in the highly acidic and protease-active stomach and insufficient permeability through the intestinal
epithelium and mucosa. This STTR Phase I project aims to develop a fast-acting oral insulin formulation based
on the patented innovation of milk protein casein coated drug-carrying nanoparticles (casNP) to encapsulate
insulin and the intestinal absorption enhancer, sodium caprate (C10), for small intestine-targeted delivery of
insulin by protecting insulin and C10 from the gastric pH and protease action but enabling the enzyme-triggered
release of insulin and C10 in the small intestine. The liquid formulation of nano-sized casNP/inslulin/C10 also
facilitates rapid gastric emptying and intestinal permeation and absorption as expected in a fast-acting oral
insulin agent for controlling the postprandial blood glucose levels. Developed casNP/insulin/C10 nanoconstruct
and encapsulated insulin will be labeled with near infrared (NIR) fluorescent dyes for non-invasive tracking of
casNP/insulin/C10 delivery and the subsequent insulin release and absorption in the streptozotocin (STZ)
induced diabetic mouse model. We will prepare and optimize the casNP/insulin/C10 formulation with desired
physiochemical and biological properties, including insulin and C10 loading capacities, stability in the simulated
gastric condition and controlled release in the intestine-mimicking condition (Aim 1). We will determine the
biodistribution of casNP/insulin/C10, plasma and hepatic insulin bioavailability and the systemic cytotoxicity in
STZ-induced diabetic mice using NIR and magnetic resonance imaging along with histopathological analyses
and validation, followed by evaluating the efficacy of casNP/insulin/C10 in controlling hyperglycemia (Aim 2).PROJECT NARRATIVEThe proposed STTR Phase I project is to develop a fast-acting oral insulin formulation using a
nanocomposite made from natural milk protein caseins for co-delivery of insulin and a mucosa permeation
enhancer, sodium caprate (C10). The developed oral insulin formulation has high stability and can resist the
highly acidic gastric condition, enabling delivery of insulin and C10 to the targeted small intestine. With
successful development, this fast-acting oral insulin formulation will replace the traditional insulin injection and
offer diabetic patients with a safe, convenient, more efficacious and cost-effective insulin therapy to better
manage their diabetic conditions."

tumor of the pediatric central nervous system (CNS). The standard treatment of MBs includes surgical
resection, followed by chemo- or radiation treatments. Dissemination of cancer cells and subsequent
metastasis is one of the major causes of treatment failure. Early identification of MB metastases is important in
applying timely and proper follow-up treatment and improving outcome of MB patients. Current clinical
methods for detection of MB metastases are: 1) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of spine, and 2) cytology
or flow cytometry analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected through the lumbar puncture
procedure. Neither method is sensitive enough for the early detection of metastases and well-tolerated by
pediatric patients. More importantly, they are not easily accessible and available in low-resource areas.
Without early detection, aggressively treating pediatric patients can lead to over-treatment caused CNS
damage. Therefore, there is a critical need in highly sensitive and robust methods for detecting rare MB cells
spread in CSF and blood, especially for patients having no or limited access to imaging and complicated
hospital procedures. The goal of this phase I STTR project is to develop an ultra-sensitive liquid biopsy
technology to capture MB cells in blood samples of MB patients, with the readout simply done with minimal
training and resources. While various circulating cancer cells (CTCs) detection methods have been developed,
sensitivity and specificity of current technologies are limited by the unwanted interactions between detecting
systems and non-specific biomaterials and cells in blood samples, e.g., the formation of protein corona and
adsorption of non-cancerous cells on the surface of cell capturing devices. Such biofouling effect not only
attenuates the affinity of targeting ligands, causing loss of biomarker specificity, but also generates undesirable
background, leading to inaccurate results. Consequently, there is no CTC detection method currently available
to detect MB spread in the blood. This STTR project will address these problems with several patented
technologies, including: (1) anti-biofouling coating polymer for reducing protein corona and non-specific cell
uptake to improve biomarker targeting and specificity of cell capture, and (2) high magnetism magnetic iron
oxide nanorods (IONRs) for efficient immuno-magnetic cell capturing. The project aims to: (1) develop and
optimize an anti-biofouling ultra-magnetic IONR as a cell capturing agent; (2) determine and optimize the
effectiveness of developed IONRs for capturing circulating GFP tagged MB cells in the blood of GFP
transgenic MB mice; and (3) test the developed immuno-magnetic capturing technology for detecting MB cells
in blood samples from patients with clinically confirmed MB metastases. If successful, proposed technology for
early detection of MB metastasis will be further developed in the Phase II with a product to make a practice-
changing impact on the clinical management of MB patients, especially those in low-resource settings.PROJECT NARRATIVE Early detection of metastasis of medulloblastoma (MB), the most common pediatric
brain tumor, is important to improve the outcome and life quality of pediatric brain tumor patients. The goal of
this phase I STTR project is to develop an ultra-sensitive liquid biopsy technology to capture circulating MB
cells in blood samples readily collected from MB patients. This practice-changing and paradigm shifting
approach will replace insensitive, complicated and expensive MRI and CSF cytology based detection methods
in the current clinical management of MB patients, especially for those with limited access to the resources
needed in the current clinical practice."

The company plans to build a much-needed technical infrastructure for schools, enrichment providers, and parents. By automating and simplifying the process of providers supplying, parents consuming and schools hosting enrichment activities, the proposed system will remove significant friction and create an efficient market. A key invention is the company's Automatic Schedule Recommendation System which recommends a schedule of classes for a family of one or more children and satisfies constraints such as ages and driving distance, maximizes desirable attributes such as minimal driving and diversity in classes across time, and leverages historical data like classes taken in the past and social data such as classes enjoyed by friends and classmates, to make effective recommendations. The proposed technology removes the most significant friction during parents' purchases of enrichment classes, namely, piecing together a class schedule from classes across different providers. This project is the first interdisciplinary research that strategically combines algorithms from the fields of optimizations and recommender systems to solve the problem and achieve scalability and efficiency. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design, implement and evaluate an Automatic Schedule Recommendation System. Existing recommender systems are insufficient because they largely recommend a single item to a single user; this application requires that a sequence of items (namely, a sequence of classes that fit in a coherent schedule) be recommended and coordinated among a group of users (i.e. children in the same family or set of friends). Existing class scheduling algorithms are insufficient because they find optimal schedules using known preferences; in this problem there is a need to predict preferences. The company will design a fully-automatic schedule recommendation system that predicts the suitability of each session to each user using machine learning techniques and aggregates these predictions over time to propose full schedules that are most appropriate for a parent and satisfy multi-dimensional constraints.

This is because high Ni cathode materials suffer from multiple failure modes caused by the high Ni content itself: 1) bulk destabilization of the structure in the charged state where oxygen is oxidized and lost, leaving Ni2+ which migrates from the transition layer into the lithium layer; 2) a change in nickel oxidation stateÂ at the grain boundaries where the ordered, layered structure converts to spinel and thenÂ NiO, increasing impedance and promoting intragranular cracking; and 3) electrolyte instability at the surface, where Ni4+ and Ni2+ oxides serve as catalytic surfaces causing gassing and other decomposition pathways for the electrolyte solvent.Â Â Single-crystal cathode materialsÂ have demonstrated benefits in cycle life, reactivity, and safety Â through mechanisms that address the failure modes of high-nickel materials. Namely, single crystal materials have no intraparticle grain boundaries vulnerable to failure mode 2.Â Also, single crystal cathode grain surfaces have lower surface area and are relatively defect free compared to their polycrystalline counterparts, mitigating failure mode 3. Ã¢ÃÂÂ¯Thus, single crystal materials can enable 811 and higher nickel contents, because both modes 2 and 3 are reduced or eliminated.Â Unfortunately, the same factors causing performance challenges in high Ni materials also make the production of single crystal materials challenging and expensive, requiring multiple additional process steps when made by conventional methods. Â 6Kâs patented UniMeltÂ® microwave plasma materials production technology represents a solution to these challenges.Â The UniMeltÂ® process is high throughput, scalable, sustainable, and offers a significant cost advantage over the conventional coprecipitation method, particularly for single crystal materials. 6K has performed early proof of concept work showing that single crystal high Ni NMC material can be produced using UniMeltÂ®.Â In phase 1 of this program, we propose to complete the feasibility demonstration, achieving full electrochemical performance and demonstrating single crystal NMC with Ni contents up to 0.9, laying the groundwork for a low cost domestic supply of advanced oxide cathode materials."

Prices are currently around $200 per kilowatt our. One path to reduced cost per kilowatt hour is by reducing cathode cost and improving their energy density. Cathode materials account for up to 25% of the battery pack cost. Cost reductions can be achieved by reducing raw material costs, reducing production costs, and increasing specific capacity of cathode materials with nickel rich materials. Cathode materials will be manufactured with a single-step continuous microwave-generated plasma materials processing technology (UniMeltâ¢) The processing technique processes each precursor droplet within the same thermal path and thermal history, leading to tight control of phase purity, size and size distribution, and performance of the product for cost effective manufacture of commercially relevant quantities of cathodes for electric vehicle batteries.

Traditional and high energy Ni-rich cathode materials were produced using the UniMelt process, and their electrochemical performance was verified. The proposed Phase II work is aimed to reduce battery cost per kilowatt hour by: (i) demonstrating process scale-up, (ii) validating the proposed cost-models, (iii) strengthening US-based cathode end-user relationships/collaborations aimed at continuing this work beyond the Phase II timeline and into commercial production.

Currently, cathode material dictates battery performance and is the most expensive of the three, accounting for up to 25% of the battery pack cost. Reducing the cost of the cathode material represents a significant decrease in the cost of the battery. Cathode cost is determined mostly by raw material and production costs. The goal of the proposed project is to reduce (i) the production cost of cathode materials and (ii) the environmental footprint associated with cathode material production while maintaining high- performance. For this Phase I project, we will focus on NMC 532, which is the current industry standard for state of the art automotive batteries. We expect the underlying technology we develop in this program to be broadly applicable to all transition metal oxide cathodes, and may also result in more viable pathways to the next generation cathode materials â the so-called ni- rich NMCâs. We will accomplish our goal using Amastanâs UniMeltâ¢ single-step continuous microwave- generated plasma materials processing technology. Unlike conventional incumbent cathode material manufacturing techniques requiring many processing steps and producing environmentally unfriendly chemical byproducts, adding to cost, the proposed process is carried out in a continuous single step without process byproduct. The UniMelt process uses solution precursor mixed at the molecular level as feedstock. The solution precursor is used to produce uniform diameter droplets that are injected into a uniform temperature electrodeless plasma column of up to 4â in diameter, where they undergo chemical reactions. This offers each precursor droplet the same thermal path and thermal history, leading to tight control of phase purity, size and size distribution of the product. The preliminary technical results of this phase will guide us to perform comprehensive cost analysis of the final cathode material production at commercial scale."

On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a global Coronavirus
Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The disease is characterized by severe flu-like symptoms,
with advanced age (andgt;65 years) an important risk factor for SARS-CoV-2-induced death. Current
clinical stage CoV-2 vaccine programs must include this important and vulnerable population in

disease. Integrin activating compounds are immune modulators that can potentiate productive
responses to vaccine antigens; our preliminary data gives us strong confidence they may be
similarly effective in enhancing effectiveness of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, especially in
aged populations. This study will directly test the hypothesis that a novel, proprietary integrin
activator (7HP349) delivered with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (RBD containing domain)
vaccine candidate will generate high titer neutralizing antibodies that will yield protective
outcome (neutralization) post challenge with viral agents. Our premise is that 7HP349 can be
used as oral immune activator to augment systemic immunity of vaccines as a prophylactic tool
to control spread of SARS-CoV-2. It is furthermore envisioned to be used with an existing

This proposal is in response to the parent announcement for Phase II STTR (R42) grant applications.
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has become a preferred treatment for hematological malignancies and
certain genetic disorders. Umbilical cord blood has become an appealing alternative to bone marrow or
peripheral blood as a source of hematopoietic stem cells for transplant. Due to a less stringent HLA match
requirement, cord blood transplant has allowed patients to be treated that otherwise could not find a suitable
donor. Unfortunately, there are fewer stem cells in these preparations which results in delayed rates of
immunological reconstitution. This can lead to a higher incidence of opportunistic infections which increases
the rate of graft failures and transplant related mortalities. Finding a means to improve the rate of immune
reconstitution with cord blood transplants would translate to improved outcomes as well as broader applicability
to adult patients. Efforts to improve the rate of engraftment of cord blood cells include targeting the cell
adhesion cascade which mediates cell homing, extravasation and retention in the bone marrow. This process
is coordinated through the function of chemokines as well as the selectin and integrin families of cell adhesion
molecules. Promising results have been generated by treating the cells ex-vivo to improve the function of the
selectin- and chemokine-mediated processes. A drawback to these preconditioning steps is they require
additional time, expertise and expense. As yet the integrins have not been targeted due to a lack of suitable
reagents. We have developed a unique small molecule that can activate integrins on cord blood cells,
facilitating their interaction with their counter-receptors in the bone marrow. This compound can enhance all
phases of the adhesion cascade including cell rolling, firm adhesion, and migration. It can be dosed
independently of the cells and is inexpensive to synthesize on a large-scale. This would have an advantage
over other technologies as no preconditioning or manipulations of the cells would be required meaning a more
affordable and universally translatable therapy. We have demonstrated proof-of-concept in our phase I studies
that dosing 7HP349 following transplant of human CD34+ cord blood cells into NOD-SCID mice leads to
increased engraftment of CD34+ cells in the bone marrow and increased CD45+ cell counts in peripheral
blood. Our phase II proposal includes aims to refine the dosing schedule and preclinical formulation and
toxicity studies required to file an Investigational New Drug application with the Food and Drug Administration.PROJECT NARRATIVE
The growing use of umbilical cord blood cells for bone marrow transplantation has allowed patients to be
treated that otherwise could not find a suitable donor. Finding a means to improve the rate of immune
reconstitution is critical to fully realize the potential of cord blood transplant and expanding its use to adult
patients. The studies proposed describe the use of a small molecule cell adhesion activator to facilitate the
engraftment rate of cord blood cells and thus decrease the time to immune reconstitution."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs), such aPD-1 agents (nivolumab, and pembrolizumab), are the current
standard of care treatment for the frontline management of advanced melanoma and other solid tumors.
However, ~70% of patients with approved FDA indications do not respond. Importantly, once patients
progress, there are limited treatment options. Primary and acquired resistance to checkpoint inhibitors may be
due to the lack of immune effector cell priming and trafficking into tumor tissue. 7HP349 is a first-in-concept,
oral, small molecule, positive allosteric activator of specific integrin cell adhesion molecules, VLA-4 and LFA-1,
which are essential for generation of a cellular immune response against solid tumors. These integrins are
critical for T cell priming and tumor infiltration, and have been shown necessary for the effectiveness of
immune checkpoint inhibitors, as well as for T cell vaccines. 7HP349, as systemic drug, has shown
enhancement of spontaneous anti-tumor immunity alone or in combination with CPIs. Based on its favorable
preclinical profile, US Food and Drug Administration, Division of Oncology Products 3, has approved the
7HP349 IND to conduct the proposed Phase 1 first-in-human study to lay the foundation for future studies in
cancer patients. cGMP drug substance and drug product have been developed for first-in-human studies. In
this Direct to Phase II grant, we plan to assess the safety and tolerability, and determine the 7HP349 optimal
pharmacokinetic dose (OPD) and optimal biologic dose (OBD) for improving immune checkpoint blockade by
performing the first-in-human study in healthy volunteers. This proposed Phase I study will not only guide the
future evaluation of 7HP349 to augment antigen presentation in solid tumor patients that have failed PD-1-
based therapies for potential approval in refractory melanoma, but also lay the foundation for the potential use
in increasing the effectiveness of infectious disease vaccines.PROJECT NARRATIVE:
Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies are ineffective in ~70% of solid tumor patients potentially due inefficient
immune priming. We have identified a first-in-concept integrin activator, 7HP349, which promotes antigen
specific immune responses, and reverses resistance of checkpoint inhibitor in resistant mouse tumor models.
7HP349 has the potential to significantly increase response rates in patients progressing on immune
checkpoint therapy."

The ratio between the amount of hot water and electricity can be varied based on demand. We use a proprietary silicon cell (patent pending with Department of Energy). Optional hot water storage tanks and electrical storage (super capacitors) can be integrated within the module. There is no need for mechanical devices such as Stirling engines and as a result the system is very rugged and deployable in harsh conditions. The whole system can be rapidly deployed and can be integrated with 7Solar's desiccant air conditioning system for highly efficient heating and cooling of spaces.

In this SBIR Phase I effort an approach is proposed which will modify a flow code similar to the LANMIN code to include these effects. A companion conduction code, similar to the EXITS code, will be tailored to the thermal structural geometries of the Holloman rocket sled. The operation of this code will be compatible with the output of the flow code. The shock impingement effects will incorporate the results from NASA TN D-7139 and other available analytical/experimental work on this effect. The equilibrium real air Mollier tables will be made sufficiently large to include the extreme temperature associated with mach 10 operation in the Holloman atmospheric conditions. The Mollier tables for helium will be installed for computing the heating on the sled when passing through that gas. The resultant codes will allow the Holloman Test Group to compute the thermal protection (TPS) requirements at critical locations on the sled and the bond-line temperature between the TPS and that tests of candidate TPS materials can be performed to develop the TPS needed for the rocket sled - the ultimate objective of the program.

Preliminary work has demonstrated that a recently synthesized biotin- conjugate of 25-OH-D3 can be useful for measuring the concentration of 25-OH-D3 in a laboratory sample. A biotin conjugate of 1,25-(OH)2-D3 has also been synthesized and used for binding studies. The Phase I goal will be to use these recently synthesized reagents to develop a non-radioactive assay for quantification of 25-OH-D and 1,25-(OH)2-D3 in blood. This method could then be adopted other laboratories. Most of the reagents required have been synthesized, and the investigator has responded well to most of the previous concerns.

The shortcomings prevent both students and teachers from fully leveraging the power of such systems. Existing systems 1) cannot handle raw student queries like - Ten Ford Fiestas cost $146,000. How much does each Ford Fiesta cost?, 2) do not take into account students' skill-levels to return results that is within the scope of their understanding, 3) do not have a community vetting and feedback mechanism that allows systems to learn the quality of their automated answers, and 4) discard valuable insights obtainable from students' queries that can be used to inform future classroom instruction. The query engine, which is free to use, addresses all four shortcomings, improves classroom instruction and closes the achievement gap. It empowers students of all abilities and from all communities to obtain automated answers from the AI technology and regular answers from the community of users. The community of users on the platform range from students to teachers to experts from the industry fulfilling their corporate social responsibilities. The platform is compliant with federal and state privacy regulations and is projected to earn significant Annual Recurring Revenue from corporations and EdTech companies seeking to build their brand among the K12 community. This project develops new skill-aware AI technology that automatically maps student's raw queries into topics, sub-topics and intent. The technology considers the user skill-levels and automatically constructs an answer extracted from the most relevant educational resources, with highest preference given to teachers' own resources. The technology does something more if the detected topic falls under Algebra and the intent of the query is 'How do I solve this?' It generates, on-the-fly, additional scaffolding instructions for solving the problem. This approach extends to disciplines beyond Algebra. In addition, Phase I research leverages the latest advancements in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Topic Detection to extract and track skill-levels, as well as strengths and weaknesses of students for teacher's benefit. Finally, the project will also demonstrate the efficacy of the technology in terms of queries made, relevant responses generated and its impact in terms of Algebra math outcomes.

The new patented process, named Multi-Energy Optimized Processing (MEOP), uses microwave energy to heat the biofuels precursor reactants, and ultrasound energy to better disperse and mix them. A prototype refinery based on MEOP is presently operating, generating 60 gal/hr or up to 500,000 gal/year in a continuous process (the technology readiness level is 7). Microwaves heat the reactants above their boiling point at a defined location in the reactor vessel. The frequency of the microwave heater is tuned to selectively heat only the reactants in the process, such as methanol in the synthesis of Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME), commonly known as biodiesel. Together with the superior ability to focus microwave radiation compared to traditional heating elements, the method is far more efficient in delivering process heat than traditional biofuels refineries (biodiesel: 662 BTU/gal with MEOP versus 4,912 BTU/gal status quo). The biofuels synthesis is assisted by ultrasound actuators which optimize the mixing between the reactants by creating smaller and more spatially dispersed droplets, which further reduces the required energy input compared to traditional biofuel reactors. MEOP is widely applicable and has been successfully tested with a range of products, including extracting algae oil, processing corn stover feedstock, and biodiesel from used fryer oil and a range of plant oils. The latter implies applicability to camelina oil, which has been extensively tested by the Air Force. For any given fuel chemistry, a MEOP reactor reduces catalyst use (e.g., 0.2% NaOH with MEOP versus 0.5% status quo) and pretreatment requirements: the MEOP prototype is presently running with high-FFA fatty acids, which are not normally suitable for immediate biodiesel processing. Regarding Phase II opportunities, MEOP is highly versatile and can be adapted to creating synthetic paraffinic kerosene by adding a hydrogenation step, which can be readily used as a 50% additive for AF jet fuels. Further, MEOP is scalable and sufficiently compact to enable retrofitting existing biofuels refineries to lower their energy cost. Lastly, in contrast with present commercial batch refineries, MEOP operates continuously and generates biofuels with the same energy efficiency regardless of plant size, enabling refineries small enough to be containerized and globally deployed. Beyond a Phase II project phase, MEOPâs high level of process control renders it a prime candidate to creating drop-in bio-jet fuel with no blending requirement through catalytic hydrothermal cracking, decarboxylation, and isomerization to produce the desired mix of hydrocarbons."

Leveraging a portable infrastructure and distributed processing and storage, SOAP offers the scalability needed to operate on the large volumes, velocities, and varieties of data typical of modern streaming data applications, including multi-sensor integration, digital engineering, and model and simulation. SOAP addresses the relative lack of investment into operationalizing streaming ML by directly providing a means for data engineers and scientists to create, monitor, and update ML-integrated data pipelines. SOAP includes two primary innovations: 1) services to execute ML models within lightweight, easily configurable streaming data pipelines, and 2) a service for monitoring deployed ML model performance for degrading accuracy, stability, and speed. We propose to develop the new services on top of mature, widely-adopted stream processing technologies while extending the functionality of more basic Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) tools.

of these are patients with aggressive triple negative BC (TNBC) or anti-estrogen/aromatase inhibitor resistant
(AE/AI) BC that do not have targeted therapy and rely on radiotherapy and aggressive chemotherapy. A new
approach that benefits these patients and provides increased life expectancy needs to be developed. We have
identified GP88, a glycoprotein that is produced by cancer cells and stimulates their growth and survival leading
to formation of more aggressive tumors. GP88 is found in BC but not in normal breast tissue. There is compelling
biological and clinical evidence to suggest that GP88 can be used to develop novel targeted therapy with
companion diagnostics that could impact treatment and improve survival of TNBC and AE/AI BC patients. We
have developed a tissue test to identify patients with tumors expressing GP88 and an anti-GP88 (AG1) to block
the action of GP88 on tumor tissues to a) inhibit tumor growth and b) increase the efficacy of current BC drugs.
We have safety and efficacy data in animals and will in our Phase 1 develop a dosing strategy in mice before
moving into human studies as part of the Phase 2. Additionally, a blood test has been developed to monitor
patients while on treatment. Using AG1 as the therapy with two companion diagnostic tests, we will carry out a
phase IA/B clinical trial in humans to determine safety of AG1 manufactured under GMP in the Phase 2 and will
collect tumor tissue and blood on all patients to evaluate for GP88 expression (tissue) and concentration (blood).Significance: Of ~220,000 cases of breast cancer (BC) diagnosed in the US in 2017 ~175,000 cases will be
estrogen receptor positive and 25% Her-2 overexpressing for whom targeted therapies are available as well as
biomarker tests to identify those who may benefit from such drugs. However, there are 2 major at risk BC groups
who have limited treatment choices: anti-estrogen/ aromatase inhibitor resistant population (AE/AI) and triple
negative BC population (TNBC). The PIâs discovery of a theranostic target that is a driver of tumorigenesis and
has therapeutic and companion diagnostics applications, will address both BC populations. Hypothesis: We
identified GP88, an 88 kDa glycoprotein autocrine growth /survival factor involved in deregulated growth leading
to aggressive tumor formation. The PI demonstrated GP88âs critical role in the process of cancer tumorigenesis
andamp; survival, its overexpression in BC tumors but not in normal breast tissue andamp; its secretion into biological fluids at
increased levels in BC patients compared to healthy individuals. Using a tissue test to identify patients with GP88
positive tumors and treating such patients with an antibody that neutralizes GP88 and blocks its autocrine effect
on cancer cells will inhibit tumor growth and increase efficacy of current BC drugs. Evidence: Pathological
studies established GP88 tumor expression as a predictive marker for recurrence. Clinical studies showed BC
patients with progressive BC have elevated GP88 serum levels compared to healthy individuals. In Vivo studies
demonstrated AG1, a recombinant anti-GP88 can reduce growth of human BC xenografts in mice and potentiate
the effect of SOC drugs. GMP manufacturing of AG1 has been developed. 2 lots of AG1 have been produced
and formulated as injectable. Repeat dose toxicology study in non-human primates established AG1 safety.
Strategy andamp; Approach of Fast Track SBIR: Phase 1 specific aims will collect pharmacology data in mice to
link our efficacy andamp; safety data to identify a dose and schedule for AG1 in human studies. Phase 2 will focus on
a phase IA/B clinical trial to determine safety of AG1 in humans. Tumor tissue collection and serial blood
sampling will evaluate GP88 tissue expression and blood concentration in enrolled TNBC and AE/AI BC patients
demonstrated to express GP88 correlated with outcome. The IHC test measures GP88 expression in tumor
tissue to identify GP88 positive patients. The serum GP88 EIA provides real time monitoring of disease status.
The Phase 2 Specific Aim 1 manufacture 500gms of GMP AG1 for Phase IA/B clinical studies. Specific Aim 2
perform a Phase IA/B clinical study in (a) patients with solid tumors to determine maximum tolerated dose/
optimum biological dose and (b) expansion cohorts with TNBC and AE/AI BC patients with GP88 positive tumors.
Overall Impact: Blocking action of GP88 in aggressive cancer using a first-in-class neutralizing antibody will 1)
inhibit tumor growth 2) potentiate SOC drugs. There is compelling biological and clinical evidence to suggest
GP88 is a therapeutic target with companion diagnostics for BC that could impact treatment and improve survival
of patients with TNBC and AE/AI BC."

progression or response to therapy is an unmet need in the clinical management of the disease. Imaging
technologies are currently the gold standard of such monitoring. However, there is controversy regarding the
type andamp; frequency of imaging required. Imaging is expensive, time consuming, slow to detect disease changes
and raises concern about repeated radiation exposure and costs are not always covered by insurance.
Complementary approaches to imaging such as circulating tumor cells and biomarkers are used in the Standard
of Care (SOC), although their application remains limited. A simple, cost-effective blood test to measure the level
of biomarkers which are drivers of the disease aggressiveness should provide novel solutions for real-time
monitoring of therapy response and reduce dependency on imaging in the MBC population. The PI has identified
an 88kDa glycoprotein GP88 (progranulin), elucidated its biological activity as an autocrine growth andamp; survival
factor. GP88 is secreted from cancer cells and measurable in biological fluids at higher levels in breast cancer
patients, compared to healthy individuals. Based on these characteristics, an innovative diagnostic test (Enzyme
Immunoassay â EIA) to measure GP88 in circulation was established. Our SBIR Phase 1 retrospective study
demonstrated a statistical association between serum GP88 levels measured by the EIA test and objective
measures of disease, i.e. RECIST 1.1 in 101 MBC patients. We established that a serum GP88 level of 56ng/mL
was a stratification point below which patients have improved overall survival while patients with GP88andgt;56 ng/ml
have a poor outcome. We showed that serum GP88 levels were statistically correlated to response to therapy in
addition to progression of disease unlike the SOC biomarker CA15-3 which is only associated to progression of
disease. Based on these promising data, we are proposing an SBIR Phase 2 prospective longitudinal study over
a 15-month period enrolling 120 MBC patients at two clinical sites by measuring serum GP88 level every month
with imaging performed every 3 months. The objectives are to validate the findings of phase 1 and establish the
predictive use of the GP88 test in monitoring MBC patients for disease progression/ response as an adjunct to
imaging and aid in the clinical management of such patients. Specifically, we will (1) Validate that serum GP88
levels are correlated to disease response/ progression as defined by imaging results; (2) Examine the impact of
successive high (andgt;56ng/mL) and low (andlt;56ng/mL) GP88 blood levels on future response/ progression and time
to progression as defined by imaging results; (3) Validate that patients with consistent low (andlt;56ng/mL) GP88
blood levels, have improved survival compared with patients with consistently high (andgt;56ng/mL) GP88 blood
levels. The outcomes of this phase 2 will be to establish clinical data to support commercialization of GP88 EIA
as an integral part of clinical management of MBC patients that will contribute to improved care of MBC patients
at reduced cost.There are ~40,000 deaths each year attributed to breast cancer of which 30,000 are as a result of metastatic
cancer. The ability to detect disease progression is important in the overall management of metastatic breast
cancer patients. While imaging remains the gold standard for monitoring disease status, it is expensive, time
consuming, slow to detect disease response or progression and there is concern about repeated exposure to
the associated radiation. Alternative approaches complementary to imaging have been considered or introduced
in the practice although their application in the Standard of Care remains limited. Monitoring of disease status
could be vastly improved by the measurement of biological markers involved in the disease process. We have
demonstrated that blood levels of such a biomarker, GP88, are correlated with objective measures of disease
status. In this Phase 2 grant application, we are proposing a longitudinal study to enroll 120 metastatic breast
cancer patients to examine prospectively the ability of the GP88 blood test to monitor disease status and predict
response to therapy or progression of the disease in real time. If we are successful, we will provide to the
patients and their treating oncologists a novel solution for patient monitoring in the form of a simple cost-effective
and minimally invasive blood test to predict changes in disease status ahead of restaging by imaging. This alone
will be a significant step in the clinical management of MBC patients by providing information on the patientsâ
disease status resulting in lowering exposure to radiation, decreasing toxicities of unnecessary drugs and
improving quality of life for MBC patients."

annually there are still aboutBC deaths annually  from metastatic breast cancer MBC  Thus the
ability to monitor MBC is important to determine disease status and therapy response While the gold standard
imaging is expensive time consuming and slow to detect disease response or progression circulating
biomarkers such as CA CA and CEA also used to monitor MBC have limitations due to low specificity
and sensitivity Thus providing better safe inexpensive non invasive specific and sensitive tests for new
biomarkers to monitor disease is a key component in improving MBC patient care Strategy Measurement of
critical biological drivers as biomarkers of the disease will provide a clearer understanding of current disease
state and improve proactive clinical management The PI has characterized a proprietary target biomarker GP
expressed in BC tissue secreted in BC patients blood and playing a key role in BC tumorigenesis GP  IHC
and EIA tests to measure GP  tumor expression and circulating levels in BC patients were developed and
clinically validated Supporting Evidence Pathological studies have established GP  tumor expression as a
predictive marker for recurrence Clinical studies have shown BC patients with progressive disease have
elevated GP  serum levels compared to patients with no evidence of disease or healthy individuals Patients
with poor outcome had a significantly higher GP  serum levelsng ml range  ng ml than alive patients
  ng ml range ng ml  pThese data indicate that if GP  blood levels are maintained below a yet
to be established cut off level then a patient can be expected to have a longer survival than patients with
elevated GPHypothesis Measuring serum GP  level could provide an ideal approach for monitoring
disease status in MBC patients as adjunctive to imaging This hypothesis will be investigated by measuring GP
levels in sequential retrospective serum samples collected from MBC patients enrolled in an IRB approved
study at UMGCCC and correlate such levels with objective measures of clinical outcome determined using
RECIST criteria Specific Aims we will  a establish by Kaplan Meier survival graphs a GP  threshold
value that stratify BC patients for survival and clinical outcomes  b determine if changes in GP  serum level
correlate with changes in RECISTcriteria collected at the same time points using receiver operating
characteristics curves identify GP  cutoff values that effectively stratify patients by their clinical outcome
using multivariate analysis and logistic regression evaluate if combining GP  and CA results can improve
upon and enhance the predictive performance of CA Overall Impact Since GP  is a driver of the
disease the use of the GP  EIA test has the potential to provide real time evaluation of the disease state
making GP  a better biomarker to monitor MBC than those currently available This will provide clinicians with
a new assay to assess disease status to increase predictive values of existing techniques such as imaging Of breast cancer BC related deaths  are where BC has spread outside the breast MBC  even
though at time of primary diagnosis there is often no evidence of tumor spread Thus the ability to detect and
monitor MBC is important in the management of BC Provision of safe inexpensive non invasive specific and
sensitive tests for monitoring of disease is key in disease management The PI has characterized a biomarker
called GPBiological and clinical studies have established the importance of GP  in BC aggressiveness and
as a predictive marker for recurrence Published studies demonstrated GP  is present in BC tissue but not in
corresponding normal breast tissue elevated levels of GP  in BC tumor tissue are associated with poor
outcome and compared to healthy individuals elevated GP  blood levels can be found in BC patients with
progressive disease Thus using blood tests to detect and quantify GP  during treatment could provide an ideal
target for monitoring disease progression in BC patients undergoing therapy This SBIR Phase I study will
measure GP  levels in sequential blood samples collected from MBC patients enrolled in an IRB approved
study and correlate such levels with objective measures of clinical outcome This application will explore this
relationship and determine the best cutoff level for GP  when examining sequential data in comparison to
disease status If we can establish a relationship between the GP  level in blood and the disease state the
information will be useful for disease management of MBC patients"

In 2010, there were 222,520 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed in the US, 85% being non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and157,300 lung cancer related deaths. Clearly, there is a need for additional and novel therapeutic options. The use of anti-EGF-R and anti v-EGF therapies has proven the potential of targeted therapies and monoclonal antibody approaches. The development ofnovel therapy against target critical and specific to the cancer cells but not to the normal tissues is expected to be efficacious and minimize damage to healthy cells. AandG Pharmaceutical Inc. is focused on identifying theranostic target for cancer in order to develop biological targeted therapy with companion diagnostics. These activities have led to the discovery of the 88 kDa granulin precursor (GP88), an autocrine growth factor preclinically validated as playing a role in NSCLC tumorigenesis. We haveshown that: 1) GP88 is an autocrine growth/survival factor for NSCLC; 2) increased GP88 expression in NSCLC positively correlates with increased tumorigenic properties of NSCLC; 3) GP88 mediates tumor cell angiogenesis and invasiveness; 4) NSCLC overexpressing GP88 are resistant to current therapies; 5) increased GP88 expression in malignant tissue correlates with parameters of poor prognosis while normal tissue is negative; 6) high expression of GP88 is associated with increased risk of recurrence in earlystage NSCLC; 7) lung cancer patients with poor prognosis have elevated GP88 serum levels; 8) a neutralizing anti-human GP88 monoclonal antibody (AG1) has been developed in our laboratory and been validated previously in our breast cancer xenograft system.Preliminary results using NSCLC indicated that AG1 abrogates GP88 functional activity. The phase I SBIR application focuses on fully characterizing AG1 effect on NSCLC xenografts. The specific aims are: 1) Determine the efficacy and potency of anti-humanGP88 monoclonal antibody AG1 in mono-therapy for non small cell carcinoma in nude mice xenograft models. We will determine the optimal therapeutic dose of AG1 in xenograft models with H1299 and A549 cells widely used as NSCLC models; 2) Determine the effect of AG1 antibody in combination therapy with chemotherapeutic agents (docetaxel, cisplatin and gemcitabine) that are used in the standard of care for NSCLC. Initially, optimal therapeutic dose for docetaxel, cisplatin and gemcitabine will be determined using A549 and NCI-H1299 xenografts in a monotherapy regimen. We will determine if AG1 combined with each chemotherapeutic drug will potentiate its effect. At the conclusion of this Phase I, we will have demonstrated whether GP88 is a candidate for NSCLC targeted therapy and established the optimal therapeutic effects of AG1 for NSCLC. If successful, such novel therapy will have the potential to improve treatment and increase the survival outcomes and quality of life of NSCLC patients. PUBLIC HEALTHRELEVANCE: Lung Cancer remains the leading cause of cancer and mortality for both men and women worldwide. AandG Pharmaceutical Inc. has discovered a novel target that plays a critical role in tumor growth, survival and resistance to current therapies. The laboratory has developed agents that can block the action of this growth factor on tumor formation.

However, ~40% of patients will be, or become resistant to AIs. If sensitivity to AI can be re-established in patients that have become resistant, this would be a major step forward in treating ER+ BC patients. The PI has characterized a growth factor, GP88, and demonstrated its critical role in the development, proliferation and survival of cancer cells. Importantly, the PI has demonstrated using in vitro studies that GP88 is a driver in controlling cancer cell resistance to AIs such as Letrozole. The PI has developed a neutralizing monoclonal anti-GP88 antibody, shown in vitro to return BC cell sensitivity to AIs in previously AI resistant cell lines. This application seeks to prove through the use of xenograft studies that anti-GP88 is effective in vivo in restoring AI sensitivity in previously resistant tumors. If successful, anti-GP88 in conjunction with AI therapy in AI resistant patients would be a major advancement in treating BC patients that currently have systemic chemotherapy as their only option and could improve overall BC survival."

Although BC can be controlled if detected early, a significant number is not detected until later and these patients are treated using therapies tocontrol both primary tumor and micro-metastatic disease. Therapy response is monitored using imaging and clinical assessment. Failure to detect early progression is a missed opportunity to adopt suitable therapies at a time when their impact on the diseasecan be maximized. Identification and validation of surrogate markers for identification of disease progression would provide clinicians with timely information in the management of BC therapy. The purpose of this application is to investigate the performance characteristics of the novel 88kDa autocrine growth factor GP88 as a surrogate marker for disease progression in breast cancer patients. GP88 is a critical biological driver for proliferation, survival, and invasiveness and is over expressed in invasive ductal cancers while negative in benign lesions and normal breast tissue. Two tests were developed to measure GP88 expression in cancer specimens; an IHC test for tumor biopsies and an EIA to measure circulating GP88 in biological fluids that have been validated in clinical trials. Tissue GP88 expression was predictive marker of BC recurrence while serum GP88 was elevated in BC patients with progressive disease, but not in BC patients with no evidence of disease. The specific aims of this revised SBIR Phase I are to investigate GP88 as a surrogate marker for disease progression in BC patients enrolled in the I-SPY Trial. The I-SPY trial is a national study to identify biomarkers predictive of response to therapy throughout the treatment cycle for women with Stage 3 breast cancer in neoadjuvant setting. This trial enrolled 221 patients with tissue and serum samples collected at specific time points pre and post-treatment and subjects followed for three years post-therapy. 122 (55%) patients benefited from neo-adjuvant treatment, 40 (18%) patients received some benefit (tumors reduced by 10% - 40%) and 59 (27%) patients showed no benefit (disease progressed). Aims are: 1: Determine if serum/tissue GP88 levels are a surrogate marker to identify breast cancer patients not benefiting from on-going neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. We will determine if there is a correlation between GP88 level and decreased/increased tumor volume in chemo-naive patients undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. 2: Determine if serum GP88 canbe used to identify breast cancer patients most likely to have recurrence following an initial benefit from neo-adjuvant therapy. We will determine if there is a quantifiable difference in the risk of recurrence between those patients with high and low serum or tissue GP88 levels, prior to commencing neo-adjuvant therapy. Upon completion of these specific aims, this investigation will evaluate GP88 as a surrogate to identify disease progression in patients undergoing chemotherapy and additionally if initialserum GP88 level prior to commencing therapy is correlated to risk of recurrence and will provide additional tools to clinicians to monitor therapy response and disease progression during and after treatment.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: (Lay) Breast cancer (BC) incidence in US women is second only to lung cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer related death; 40,000 women die annually. Patients in whom BC is detected as having spread beyond the breast are treated with radiation, chemotherapyand/or hormonal therapy prior to potential surgery. During and post treatment, tumor response is monitored using x-ray and clinical evaluation, imprecise methods for detection of subtle changes in tumor size that may indicate treatment failure. Use of X-ray imaging is relatively infrequent, subjective and requires availability of prior studies. There are no easily available specific diagnostic markers, direct or surrogate, for monitoring disease activity in BC. We have identified GP88 as a biomarker that may be used as a surrogate for detection of tumor changes in BC patients undergoing therapy. Preliminary data in a small study demonstrated that GP88 can be identified in serum of BC patients and is elevated in patients with progressive disease but not in patients with no evidence of disease following therapy, thus indicating that it may be useful as a surrogate marker for assessing response to chemotherapy. This project will investigate the use of GP88 as a surrogate marker for detection of non-response tochemotherapy and will provide information that may enable clinicians to adopt 2nd or 3rd line therapies when they may be most effective and may save patients un-necessary toxicity and costs associated with ineffective 1st line therapy."

Major shortcomings with current treatment are the high level of side effects induced in patients and insufficient efficacy, particularly for patients with metastatic disease. Targeted cancer therapy is designed to treat only the cancer cells and minimize damage to healthy cells. These targets are critical to the tumor's malignant phenotype but not to the host's normal tissues, improving outcomes while minimizing systemic side effects. Anti-HER2, Herceptin, leads the way for targeted therapy in breast cancer with a much lower incidence of side effects and definite efficacy in a specific but small subset of patients. However, there is a clear need for additional therapeutic options including other novel targeted therapies. The 88 kDa autocrine growth factor called PC-Cell Derived Growth Factor (PCDGF), also known as granulin precursor (GP88), has been shown to play a critical role in breast cancer cell biology, exemplified by the following: 1) GP88 is an autocrine growth/survival factor for breast cancer cells, 2) increased GP88 expression in breast cancer cells is associated with increased tumorigenicity, 3) GP88 mediates tumor cell angiogenesis and invasiveness, 4) breast cancer cells overexpressing GP88 are resistant to current therapies - Tamoxifen, Faslodex, doxorubicin, 5) increased GP88 expression in breast cancer tissue correlates with clinical parameters of poor prognosis while normal and benign breast tissue are negative, 6) patients with poor prognosis have elevated GP88 serum levels. These experiments show the essential role that GP88 plays in breast cancer cell tumorigenesis and that the inhibition of GP88 expression or function leads to inhibition of tumor growth. These results highlight the importance of GP88 for targeted therapy of breast cancer via the development of anti-GP88 therapeutic neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). Our Phase I research proposed to evaluate a library of murine anti-GP88 for antigen binding properties and for biological activity in GP88-dependent in vitro and in vivo functional tumor cell models. These Phase I specific aims were accomplished and resulted in the identification of anti-GP88 neutralizing Mabs with the in vitro and in vivo potency and efficacy to be candidates for targeted therapy in breast cancer to address a vitally important unmet clinical need. We have selected one Mab, AG1, for further pre-clinical development activities, specifically the generation and characterization of a recombinant Mab (chimerized and humanized Mabs). The following Specific Aims are proposed for this Phase II SBIR application: 1. Cloning of the cDNA encoding the variable sequences of the light chain and heavy chain of the antibody expressed by the AG1 hybridoma cells and generation of expression vectors for both a humanized (HuAG1) and a mouse-human chimeric antibody (ChAG1). 2. Transient expression of the HuAG1 and ChAG1 chimeric antibodies and validation of their binding properties. The antigen binding characteristics and biological activities of the cloned, expressed HuAG1 and ChAG1 will be evaluated and compared with the murine AG1 Mab in order to select candidate recombinant AG1 that fit acceptance criteria for further development. 3. Generate stable HuAG1- or ChAG1-producing cell clones. HuAG1 or ChAG1 selected above will be stably expressed in CHO cells. The HuAG1- or ChAG1-producing clones will be compared for cell growth performance, antibody productivity, and metabolic profile in order to select a candidate clone for scale-up production. 4. Express, purify and characterize the biological properties of the HuAG1 or ChAG1 Mab. The Mab will be evaluated in relevant in vitro and in vivo functional tumor cell models and compared directly with the murine AG1 Mab. GP88 represents a novel, pre-clinically validated target for breast cancer. At the conclusion of this research in this Phase II project, we will have generated a mouse/human chimeric Mab with the in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical efficacy and potency for targeted therapy of breast cancer and we will have developed an optimized clonal antibody production cell line suitable for transfer to a CMO for contract manufacturing. However, once this chimeric anti-GP88 Mab has been generated and characterized it will require further pre-clinical development activities (e.g. formulation, pharmacokinetics and safety) before IND filing for clinical trials in breast cancer. These additional development activities will serve as the basis for a subsequent continuation/renewal Phase II SBIR application.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast cancer remains one of the top three cancers to affect and cause mortality in women. Major shortcomings with current treatment are the high level of side effects induced in patients and insufficient efficacy, particularly for patients with advanced disease. The innovative breast cancer therapy to be developed in this proposal will target a mechanism inherent in breast cancer but avoid the side effects associated with many current breast cancer therapies."

In T cells, Lck plays an essential role in the generation of antigen-mediated activation signals. Since T cell activation is central to mounting immune response, inhibition of Lck blocks T cell activation and suppresses the immune response. Accordingly, Lck serves as an ideal target for the development of novel immunosuppressant agents. Motivated by these biological properties, a combined computer-aided drug design (CADD) and experimental program was undertaken to identify novel Lck inhibitors. Targeting the pY+3 region of the SH2 domain of Lck a series of Lck inhibitors have been discovered. A subset of these compounds has been shown to be specific for Lck versus other SH2 domain containing Src family kinases with affinities for Lck in the low micromolar range. These Lck selective compounds inhibited mixed lymphocyte reaction in vitro, and popliteal lymph node local allogeneic responses in mice and adjuvant arthritis, a rat experimental model of rheumatoid arthritis in vivo. These compounds have therapeutic potential as immunosuppressants/modulators. In this application we propose to determine the rank order of these compounds for their therapeutic efficacy. The goal of this Phase I project is to select which lead compound for synthetic chemistry lead optimization to be proposed in a Phase II SBIR application. The ultimate goal is an FDA IND submission of a drug candidate for Phase I clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis, MS or other chronic inflammatory diseases.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of high prevalence in the U.S. and the other major developed countries, affecting over 2 million U.S. citizens, resulting in over 3 billion in medical costs and other indirect expenses annually. The treatment of RA includes traditional pharmacological agents as well as breakthrough biologics, e.g. targeting TNF alpha. The TNF blockers have increased efficacy in a subset of patients but the costs of these drugs are in excess of 10,000 - 20,000 per year. Other chronic inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis also are treated by these high cost biological therapeutics. There is a significant unmet medical need for drugs with increased efficacy in a larger proportion of patients and that are more cost effective. The specific aims of this project are designed to identify a lead compound with the biological efficacy, potency and safety suitable for subsequent lead optimization and in-depth evaluation in disease-relevant animal models, safety pharmacology and toxicology. The ultimate goal is development of an effective drug candidate for these chronic inflammatory diseases that will be substantially more cost effective than the breakthrough biologics."

Many illnesses, including cancers, autoimmune diseases, and neurological diseases, can be treated by controlling the activity or abundance of specific proteins in the cell. However, many proteins cannot be targeted by traditional drugs. Instead, pharmaceutical companies are now using a new strategy to hijack the cellâs native quality control pathways and degrade proteins to control their abundance rather than their activity. This approach has been validated as a powerful therapeutic strategy, but significant challenges remain for discovering molecular glues. The proposed platform for molecular glue discovery is expected to have a major commercial and societal impact by conducting high-throughput screening. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to advance the development of a novel platform for discovering molecular glues, or drugs that function by agonizing protein-protein interactions. This platform combines the throughput of a cell-based assay with the accuracy of a bioanalytical technique by linking yeast haploid mating efficiency to the affinity of proteins displayed on the cells' surfaces. Initial results demonstrate that next generation sequencing of diploid cells can be used to simultaneously measure the affinity of many protein-protein interactions with high accuracy and correctly determine the effect of well-characterized small molecules that inhibit or enhance particular protein-protein interactions. Additionally, the platform is functional in a 96-well plate format, which is important for compatibility with standard high-throughput screening workflows. The primary goals of this project are to improve the sensitivity of the platform for the detection of molecular glues that induce a weak protein-protein interaction, reduce the per-well screening cost by improving assay efficiency, and incorporate new proteins into the platform and validate their function with existing small-molecules.

PPIs play a pivotal role in most diseases, and are considered high-impact therapeutic targets for cancers, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and more. Over 40 clinically relevant PPIs have been disrupted successfully with small molecules, and several have entered clinical trials. One recently approved cancer drug, Venetoclax, is expected to reach $2.2B in sales by 2020. Despite the enormous clinical and commercial potential of PPI disrupting drugs, preclinical characterization remains a major challenge. Pharmaceutical companies are limited by slow and laborious techniques to measure protein interactions that require each protein to be purified, and each PPI to be measured separately. As a result, only a small subset of relevant interactions are tested during preclinical drug development, which leads to a high incidence of failure during clinical trials. The proposed platform for PPI network characterization is expected to have a major commercial and societal impact by enabling more thorough preclinical screening of PPI inhibiting drugs, reducing the overall cost and time associated with drug development. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and commercialize a novel platform for screening PPI disrupting drugs that provides quantitative accuracy, enables simultaneous characterization of whole PPI networks, and eliminates the need for protein purification. This platform combines the throughput of a cell-based assay with the accuracy of a bioanalytical technique by linking yeast haploid mating efficiency to the affinity of proteins displayed on the cells' surfaces. Preliminary results demonstrate that next generation sequencing of diploid cells may be used to accurately measure many PPI strengths simultaneously. The goal of this project is to demonstrate that the proposed platform can correctly recapitulate whole disease-relevant PPI networks and accurately characterize well-studied inhibitors in a format that is compatible with existing high-throughput screening workflows. To demonstrate feasibility, the well-studied BCL2 PPI network, which contains unstable proteins and considerable complexity, will be analyzed to identify each pairwise PPI and compared to known interactions from the literature. The yeast strains and assay parameters will then be optimized for screening water insoluble small molecule drugs and 96-well plate compatibility.

Future extensions to the proposed system could provide contact detection and classification (âRed Forceâ tracking) and underwater communications at depth and speed. The primary technical challenge facing underwater laser communication is propagating the laser beam over meaningful distances. Laser energy is degraded by absorption and scattering from particulate matter suspended in sea water. We propose to research adaptive optics (AO) technology to measure, in-situ, the distortion induced by the seawater and to extend the propagation distance of the laser link by correcting those aberrations, in real-time, using deformable optics. We propose to research atom interferomtry as our time-keeping technology and investigate the accuracy achievable in the Underwater Satellite operating environment. The proposed system, enabling submarines and other submerged vessels to covertly receive GPS-based position information at depth and speed, with no dependence on the earth-orbiting GPS satellites, would reduce opportunities for adversaries to detect our submarine force and would improve operational effectiveness."

(APT) and teammates, Karagozian & Case (K&C) and Applied Research Associates (ARA), are proposing to develop an innovative Fast-Running Model (FRM) for Debris Prediction Methodology (DPM) for hardened structure secondary debris that will enhance existing Navy and Department of Defense (DoD) site planning and design methodologies and tools. APT will utilize state-of-the-art High-Fidelity Physics-Based (HFPB) computational tools to generate synthetic data to be used for development of a new FRM. HFPB computational tools have made substantial progress in their fidelity and reliability and have become a proven technology capable of accurately predicting the response and breakup of structures and the associated secondary debris. Proper use of HFPB tools by expert users can generate the necessary data for a new DPM FRM within the scope of a SBIR program. However, traditional HFPB methods are difficult for DoD stakeholders to verify and validate, require large computational resources (CPU time and memory) for any one weapon-target-interaction (WTI) scenario, and are challenging to reduce and simplify to modify the existing methodologies. With this in mind, the APT team propose conducting a Research and Development (R&D) effort towards solving three key challenges: (1) incorporating reliability analysis and stochastic procedures into the recently developed HFPB Coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics and Computational Solid Dynamics (CFD/CSD) computational models capable of predicting the response, limit states, and secondary debris of structures in expedited time scales; (2) developing methods to validate the HFPB CFD/CSD models with existing and future sub-scale and full-scale test data; and (3) developing FRMs that utilize both experimental and computational secondary debris data to enhance the existing methodologies in the DoDâs Technical Papers. By the end of Phase II, APT plans to deliver DPM FRMs that provide improved analytic capabilities and a debris-specific model that will do for debris prediction what TP-17/Blast Effects Computer (BEC) has done for airblast prediction, i.e., provide a , i.e., fast-running, reliable, and easy to use tool. APT anticipates that the results of the proposed R&D can directly support the Navy in upgrading the methodologies to improve design regulations and standard designs for magazines, including hardened structures. APT is well-positioned to lead the effort to support the Navy in a transition to modern viable tools for secondary debris prediction. APTâs background in explosives safety, secondary debris data collection and processing, and in FRM development will supply key insights to ensure that the FRM will meet Naval Ordnance Safety and Security Activity (NOSSA) needs. Further, by partnering with K&C and ARA, the team will bring state-of-the-art CFD, finite element and mesh-free CSD, Coupled CFD/CSD, and hybrid computational capabilities to ensure a highly innovative solution."

ATA is proposing the Magnetic Cylinder Gyro (MCG), a non-MEMS 2-DOF rate gyro based on a spinning magnetic sphere. The MCG is a relatively simple device with minimal parts count yet has the potential for very high performance with low SWaP and cost. Initial analysis of the MCG shows promise of a small, rugged, low power gyro in a relatively small package (~1 in3 MSG volume goal). The MCG has the potential for low cost in volume production due to low parts count and because many of the fundamental MCG components are currently COTS components produced in high volume and at low cost. The Phase I effort will focus on the design, fabrication, and the characterization of the MCG Engineering Development Unit (EDU). The MCG EDU is a critical laboratory experiment unit to demonstrate the MSG physical principles and the MCG concept feasibility to achieve the required IMU improvements. ATA will leverage our inertial device development and IRU/IMU expertise in the development of the MCG and tactical IMUs.BENEFIT:There are numerous technical benefits to ATAs Magnetic Cylinder Gyro (MCG): 1) high reliability, 2) robustness/ruggedness in a tactical environment, and 3) non-MEMS based design. MCG will provide lower SWaP-C, lower linear shock and vibration sensitivity, and lower inherent radiation susceptibility than current gyros. MCG features a low complexity, low parts count mechanical gyro design that will provide the low costs required by tactical Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). It has the potential for high performance and can be rapidly tuned for various applications. This is in contrast to MEMS design changes, which are extremely time consuming and expensive. ATA has been developing technology for the U.S. Government and Aerospace contractors since 1975. ATAs success in generating additional revenue tied to our Phase I and Phase II SBIR projects has allowed ATA to grow and expand its business through Phase III commercialization and other spin-off contracts. As reported in the ATA Company Commercialization Report, we have received 54 Phase I SBIR awards and 22 Phase II awards. ATAs track record for commercialization of SBIR sponsored technology is excellent, resulting in a Commercialization Achievement Index of 95 and related cumulative revenues from sales and additional investments of over $42 million. ATAs approach to commercializing MCG is to use our existing infrastructure to transition MCG to the commercial marketplace. We will leverage our existing Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) network, and facilities for product development, manufacturing, and support. Because of its position in the high-precision sensor niche market, ATAs comprehensive marketing and distribution network intends to promote the MCG through existing channels primarily in the in the U.S. aerospace and defense industries. MCG has the potential to provide better solutions for inertial sensing applications in spacecraft and missiles than current technologies."

The ATA/Sandia Team is proposing the Massive Optomechanical Navigation Accelerometer (MONA), a MEMS integrated with an optical wave guide (zipper cavity). MONA will utilize a state-of-the-art optomechanical transduction scheme coupled to a large MEMS inertial sensing mass to enable incredibly high sensitivities. As a fundamental part of the design, the structure will be designed with high reliability and manufacturability, accomplished by the separation of the thin films needed for the optical transduction from the much larger bulk silicon inertial sensing structure. MONA has the potential for very high performance with extremely low SWaP and cost. Initial analysis of MONA shows promise of a small, rugged, low power accelerometer in a relatively small package (~0.25 in3). The Phase I effort will focus on the design, fabrication, and the characterization of the MONA Engineering Development Unit (EDU) where the MEMS accelerometer is integrated with the optical detector. The MONA EDU is a critical laboratory experiment unit to demonstrate the physical principles and concept feasibility to achieve the required IMU improvements.BENEFIT:There are numerous technical benefits to ATAs Massive Optomechanical Navigation Accelerometer (MONA). Integration of optomechanical sensing produces higher performance accelerometers than currently exist. MONAs large proof mass allows for a more commercially viable end product by reducing packaging challenges and will reduce thermo-mechanical noise. Our team will integrate the source and detector at the chip level and the device will have an electrical signal in and out. This proposed effort leverages existing Sandia National Laboratory (SNL) technologies and programs in MEMS fabrication and packaging, to provide a faster path to a commercially viable end product. It also leverages existing ATA capabilities in high performance packaging, which will lead to a more stable and rugged sensor system. ATA has been developing technology for the U.S. Government and Aerospace contractors since 1975. ATAs success in generating additional revenue tied to our Phase I and Phase II SBIR projects has allowed ATA to grow and expand its business through Phase III commercialization and other spin-off contracts.

ATAs track record for commercialization of SBIR sponsored technology is excellent, resulting in a Commercialization Achievement Index of 95 and related cumulative revenues from sales and additional investments of over $42 million. The market for the MONA would be large and varied, as more and more powerful technology is being placed into smaller and smaller devices for both military and commercial use. In the military markets, current trends towards smaller SWaP for tactical missions such as UAV and weapon systems, combined with the constant desire for better performance in mission critical areas such as GPS denied, are driving the need for smaller, lower power, but still higher performing accelerometers. In the commercial marketplace, that same need is driven by the challenge of delivering ever more capability in the competitive automotive, energy, and seismic markets. Because the MONA is a component that could enable such a broad range of products, we have identified current commercially available high performance accelerometers and determined that, at the start, the MONA would be a direct competitor of the Honeywell navigation grade QA2000 and 3000 accelerometers. Given that the MONA would have better performance in a lower SWaP than these Honeywell sensors, we project that we could ultimately capture a significant portion of this market, up to 1,000 units per month, once the MONA is available for commercial distribution. Competitors in the MEMS accelerometer marketplace include Colibrys and Hewlett Packard. The MONA would be a high-end performance and higher priced entry into the MEMS accelerometer marketplace. We anticipate that by targeting higher-end products that could benefit from the advanced performance we could develop additional sales of up to 500 units per month."

These converters use multiple sub-ranging stages and error correction circuitry and the high parts count results in large silicon footprints. ATA proposes designing an Advanced Radiation Hardened ADC (ARH-ADC) by implementing the innovative Residual Bit Extraction (RBE) architecture on a Rad-Hard by Design (RHBD) Via Configurable Array (VCA) Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). Our proposed architecture will provide 16 bit resolution at >25 MSPS with single clock cycle conversion and low parts count resulting in reduced silicon footprint. The targeted ASIC technology will provide a radiation-hardened by design part and the VCA ASIC development and fabrication costs are much lower than traditional ASIC costs. This approach will allow ATA to complete the design and simulation during the Phase I effort and prototype fabrication and test during the Phase II effort. Leveraging our existing RBE board level design further reduces development time and risk on this proposed Phase I effort.

NASA estimates that the current Mars to Earth transfer rate of 6 Mbps might be increased to 600Mbps using a Laser Communication (LC) system. Beam jitter caused by spacecraft-based motion must be reduced to sub-microradian levels to enable beaconless optical beam pointing. ATA will create a Compact, Lightweight Isolation Platform (CLIP) that will host the LC collimator telescope and provide a stabilized platform to prevent the 150-microradian spacecraft disturbance environment from reaching the LC terminal. To enable that stabilization, ATA will develop an ultra-low angular noise Capacitive Angular Position Sensor (CAPS). The proposed sensor will have low power and high reliability, which ATA will demonstrate by producing TRL 4 prototypes in Phase I and TRL 5 CLIP engineering development unit (EDU) in Phase II.
The integrated CLIP overall design is a major innovation. Most significantly, the platform payload capacity must increase from the typical few hundred grams to as much as 50 kilograms, roughly two orders of magnitude, but without major growth in the mass of the platform itself. While the payload for most stable platforms is only a small fraction of the platform overall mass, the CLIP payload must be from more than half (3 kg) to as much as 94 percent of the total platform mass (3-50 kg payload + 3 kg platform). Combined with the large payload range, the needed disturbance rejection from 150-microradian to less than 0.5-microradian across the broad frequency range of 0.1 to 500 Hz requires innovation in the platform suspension, high-performance actuators, servo controls, and structure. Other programs have demonstrated these requirements individually, but the innovation CLIP provides is to combine structure, suspension, actuators, and sensors to give the required performance within the stringent 3-kg weight and 15-W power constraints."

Key to autonomous flight software is a realistic simulation environment with realistic satellite models. ATA proposes a systems-driven methodology for producing high fidelity, realistic satellite models, a Realistic Autonomous Mission Manager Modeler (RAMMM). Currently, the Autonomous Mission Manager (AMM) satellite models are being developed using the Satellite Design Tool (SDT), which allows virtual satellites to be modeled without any real world constraints. ATA proposes to develop a satellite bus model using RAMMM to ensure mapping between payload and bus requirements and mapping of bus interdependencies and interactions. The results are significant because:  They form a foundation upon which to develop and incorporate higher fidelity components at all levels of the virtual spacecraft design and implementation.  They create a foundation upon which new advance control systems for both satellite bus and payload components can be implemented.  The combination of high fidelity components and advance control systems will enable more realistic scenarios and operating constraints to be incorporated into AMM research and demonstrations.  Similar processes could be applied to satellite payload autonomy requirements. BENEFIT: ATA has been developing technology for the U.S. Government and Aerospace contractors since 1975. During this time, we have developed outstanding relationships that we will leverage to bring the RAMMM technology to market.

Space objects proliferate in the near-Earth space environment. These objects range from operational satellites used for commercial communications or scientific studies to pieces of debris generated by launch vehicles, delamination of the on-board spacecraft materials, and accidental/intentional collisions. The ever-increasing number of space objects creates a need for the development of new algorithms capable of fusing and exploiting space surveillance data sources to improve the ability to detect, track, identify, and characterize man-made space objects. Current algorithmic approaches to the space object cataloguing problem treat the sub-problems of detection, tracking, identification, and characterization separately, which can lead to a loss of information. Ideally, the sub-problems should be treated as interdependent through the use of a holistic integrated framework, such as the finite-set statistics (FISST) framework. Additionally, current methods employ unnecessarily restrictive assumptions, such as linearity and Gaussian distribution of uncertainty within the filtering problem, which do not enable appropriate application to the problem of estimation for space objects. BENEFIT: Team ATA has been developing technology for the U.S. Government and Aerospace contractors since 1975. During this time, we have developed outstanding relationships that we will leverage to bring integrated detection, tracking, identification, and characterization algorithms to market.

One of the recommendations from the Committee for the Assessment of the U.S. Air Force's Astrodynamic Standards is that research efforts be put into improving the representation of uncertainty to ensure realism in estimations of uncertainty.

HEL systems hosted on aircraft pose an additional challenge to beam stabilization efforts due to the harsh linear and angular vibration environments inherent in such vehicles. A key element of the stabilization system is the Optical Inertial Reference Unit (OIRU). The ATA Tactical Inertial Reference Unit (ATA TIRU) high performance design has a resolution greater than 500 nano-radians. In addition, the ATA TIRU is designed to minimize the Size Weight and Power (SWaP) of OIRU technology. The innovative mechanical design will fit within a 3""x3""x3""cube and will consume less than 18 W of power in its quiescent state. Versatility is built into the ATA TIRU design. This provides the Air Force with a powerful, low SWaP, high performance device that can be the cornerstone for all future directed energy, laser communications, and high resolution imaging systems. ATA has a legacy of custom research and development solution success. Custom engineered solutions require a deep understanding of engineering design principles and an unwavering desire to meet the customers""needs. ATA""s is pleased to offer the Air Force the ATA TIRU technology.BENEFIT: Current OIRU technologies are too large to be placed on smaller gimbaled telescopes found in the tactical arena. The ATA TIRU is an enabling technology for the tactical arena, as up until this effort, no OIRU has been designed to meet the Size Weight and Power (SWaP) constraints that this environment levies on an OIRU. These requirements require a change in the design philosophy in current OIRU technology. ATA TIRU is our solution to this need. The ATA TIRU is based on proven ATA Magneto Hydro Dynamic (MHD) Angular Rate Sensor (ARS) technology.  The innovative mechanical design of the ATA TIRU fits within a 3""x3""x3""cube, delivers less than 500nano-radians of jitter onto its optical reference beam, and consumes less than 18 W of power in its quiescent state. The ATA TIRU advanced design provides an opportunity for ATA to market and receive funding from non-SBIR sources and it gives the Air Force unmatched state of the art OIRU performance for its future HEL weapons development programs."

The current high performance gyros are marginal in meeting the SBL aIRUperformance requirements and are very expensive. Applied Technology Associates (ATA) proposes to develop a breakthrough angular rate gyroscope that has the potential of unprecedented accuracy, low linear acceleration sensitivity, high reliability, andsuperior accuracy in the presence of high angular rates and accelerations. ATA had previously developed an innovative rate sensing technology based on magnetohydrodynamic principles referred to as the MHD effect rate gyro, or MERG. The MERG performance(5 deg/hr drift) had only approached a fraction of its theoretical limit. ATA proposes innovative design enhancements of the MERG to ultimately meet the SBL IRU performance requirements at a potentially much lower cost than current gyro technologies. Theenhanced MERG, or EMERG, will incorporate significant improvements to allow decreasing the MERG demonstrated drift rate of 5 deg/hr to less than 0.001 deg/hr. The EMERG could potentially provide the best and lowest cost long-term solution for SBL and ABLIRU applications where precision acquisition, pointing, and tracking are critical. The gyro market in guidance, navigation, attitude, position, pointing, and tracking applications had been investigated for the EMERG, and its derivatives, and was found tobe approximately 140,000 gyros per year with a total market value of over $500 million. The current market is dominated by high cost commercial aircraft applications and moderate cost tactical missile applications. Over the next ten years the market sizewill nearly double, but the mix will change. It will be dominated by a much higher volume of low cost gyros for automotive applications, and munitions and projectiles. Much of the current development emphasis is on micro-electromechanical (MEMS) gyrosand low cost fiber optic gyros (FOG).The obvious market for the EMERG designed for the Advanced Inertial Reference Unit is in the high performance ABL, SBL, and space-based surveillance systems. However, lower cost versions of the EMERG are expected to fill the performance/cost niche thatexists between the potentially low cost, low performance MEMS gyros, and the higher cost, higher performance ring laser gyros (RLG) , fiber optic gyros (FOG), hemispherical resonator gyros (HRGs), and high performance dynamically tuned gyros (DTGs). Thisniche exists for a packaged inertial measurement unit (IMU) that includes up to three gyros and three accelerometers in a single package with digital output. The IMU must be priced to sell at less than $5,000 (@10,000/yr) per three axis IMU (3 gyros, 3accelerometers), and performance must include drift rates in the 0.1Â¿/hr range. An IMU at this price and performance will significantly differentiate the EMERG from the competing systems. The cost of FOG and RLG based IMUs is about $20,000 (in smallquantities), and the drift rate performance of a MEMS gyro based IMUs is typically greater than 30Â¿/hr.In general, the market segments in which the EMERG would successfully compete include munitions and projectiles, tactical missiles, and platform/sensor stabilization, and in aircraft, ship, and land navigation."

The phase shifter design builds upon existing RF MEMS capacitive technology by co-integrating MEMS switches with metamaterial unit cells. The metamterial unit cell design is versatile and allows significant degree of freedom in integration and design. It is compatible with existing MEMS fabrication technology that utilizes Microstrip design with solid ground plane. Preliminary Ka-band phase shifter designs show that all of the design goals set under this proposal can be met. This proposal carries out the development of phase shifter by comprehensively analyzing it from design, performance, manufacturability, and utilization. The joint team together brings more than 24years of industry and research experience in the areas of RFMEMS, microwave and millimeter wave designs. A large industry partner (Raytheon) has been identified who will be instrumental in the production and commercialization of the technology. The team brings a unique ability of metamaterial design, phase shifter design, and RF MEMS technology.BENEFIT: Low-loss, non-dispersive phase shifters have the potential to revolutionize the phased array market by reducing cost per element through die area reductions and reduced part count through the use of non-dispersive, broadband elements. Further, the low loss characteristics can greatly reduce the SWAP per subarray by reducing the number of PA's/LNA by moving these elements before the main power distribution."

Data contained in these databases will include text, graphics, sound, video, etc. The project will provide 2 kinds of services: 1. Index services to increase the ease and efficiency of locating information. 2. Retrieval services to present and conditionally deliver the selected data to the user. This project will simplify the task of accessing widely distributed databases and reduce both the costs and the time required to search them. The project speeds searching by building a mesh of index servers. This allows very rapid location of relevant resources, and the potential to keep the indices constantly updated. The project facilitates access and retrieval by caching resources located by a query, and allows the user to preview them before downloading them over low-bandwidth network links. The user sees a unified system instead of a large collection of databases. Anticipated Benefits: The government and private sectors can use this system to integrate databases on an enterprise-wide or even industry-wide scale. In addition, organizations can use the idexing service to track individual documents on an enterprise-wide basis or to provide a virtual searchable library of all of the organizations documents."

Despite the existence of several mint species and many cultivars, the U.S. Mint Oil Industry is based upon three sterile clones and their minor somatic variants. The narrow genetic base of these commercial varieties could endanger the stability of the mint industry if virulence of disease and/or large-scale fluctuations in weather occur. Extensive genetic diversity exists among other mint species and the U.S. mint industry is considering more effective future exploitation of this diversity to broaden the genetic base. Unfortunately, genetic diversity in mint is very poorly characterized, and the genetic relationships among known species and cultivars remain obscure. Here, we propose evaluating the utility of simple-sequence repeat (SSR or microsatellite) DNA fingerprinting techniques for answering the following questions: What are the relative levels of genetic diversity in extent mint species and cultivars? What are the genetic relationships among those species and cultivars? How well do SSR markers discriminate among closely related cultivars?"

Boundary scan technology was designed to improve the testability and diagnosability of electronics. Its use, however, has been primarily focused on finding manufacturing faults, such as shorts, opens, missing and dead components. Tools are also geared for manufacturing tests. Predominant failure modes in US Navy fielded units are usually caused by non-catastrophic and out of tolerance conditions and these are different than production defects. Boundary scan, however achieves testability by facilitating different configurations than the normal operational one. Special test configurations can improve diagnosability as well, though to date only the testability aspects have been utilized. We show how diagnosability is improved with existing standardized IEEE-1149.1 features, like SAMPLE and EXTEST. We also propose novel uses of boundary scan to augment BIT and further reduce diagnostic complications. These new instructions will further improve diagnosability without requiring circuit design or even test programming changes. They will, instead, involve the manipulation of boundary scan data to configure the system under test to increasingly more diagnosable configurations. We propose developing user friendly software that implements diagnostician commands and performs the cumbersome boundary scan data manipulations needed to achieve reconfigurations. Improvements will allow fault isolation to a single WRA in nearly 100% of the cases. They will also help other diagnostic complications, such as cannot duplicates, retest OK, no fault found, erroneous fault isolation and false alarms."

The proposed analyzer is unique in that it will be capable of functioning effectively on a wide variety of irregular and previously inaccessible surfaces of varied composition associated with pharmaceutical cleaning verification and aerospace maintenance applications. Specifically, the project will determine the optimum means to detect trace levels of active pharmaceutical ingredients on the various materials (i.e., Teflon and stainless steel) and irregular surface geometries in pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment, using an infrared spectrum analyzer.  The need to access locations deep in inside an object will drive the requirement to miniaturize this technology and to develop novel means of accessing particularly difficult locations. For example, in aircraft maintenance, the need to probe the molecular integrity of composite material in the fuselage of a plane will require a miniature analyzer coupled with highly sensitive detector and flexible sampling probe.  The outcome of this work will be the invention of a miniaturized FTIR-based surface analyzer, which will find application in a host of key industries.
The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is substantial and will benefit a number of manufacturing related industries. By understanding what is required to develop useful technology for characterizing a wide range of surfaces by infrared analysis, as well as miniaturizing the technology for use in non-lab environments, a host of industrial applications become accessible. For example, in the pharmaceutical industry the technology will lead to on-site cleaning verification that reduces manufacturing equipment down-time and the costs to produce pharmaceuticals. In the aerospace industry, many surfaces must be cleaned, and verified as clean, during manufacturing and maintenance in order to ensure that coatings, paints and primers are effectively applied to metal, polymer and composite surfaces. For devices as sophisticated as the next generation space shuttle or composite base commercial airlines, the need to know that surfaces are properly cleaned and/or prepared is critical as it impacts vehicle maintenance and safety."

Measurement periods for these applications can range from microseconds to several hundred milliseconds. Individual measurements must be made on the order of every microsecond or more frequent. A2Z Technologies Corporation proposes to design and develop instrumentation which is broadly applicable to high-speed temperature measurement applications for Government (i.e., DOD, NASA, DOE) and industrial applications (Engine manufactures, manufactures of explosives, etc.). Specific capabilities for the proposed thermal imager are 1) non-intrusive, high temperature measurements, 2) multiple point (256 x 256) simultaneous measurements, 3) time-resolved measurements with controllable sampling intervals (1 ms - 50 ms), and 4) operate in harsh physical and EMI environments. During the proposed 6 month effort, A2Z Technologies Corporation will perform initial measurements at Naval test facilities, test the interference environment produced by the pulsed x-ray sources, design the prototype instrument, and develop, test, and demonstrate a Phase I breadboard system. All Phase I activities are for the purpose of proving the system feasibility. In addition, a Phase I option is proposed that includes 1) additional system testing and 2) prototype system design."

Given the proposed system, non-spherical and/or non-center initiated blast waves are readily characterized . Basic components of the system are muliple sensor heads, electronics modules containing amplication and TDOA circuitry, and a IEEE-488 based network of digitizers, all of which is under local computer control. During Phase I, a breadboard system will be designed and tested, include live-fire testing at Eglin AFB.

These disinfection cycles can last anywhere from one hour (ethylene oxide) to up to 24 hours (heat treatment). Our mentors at the Tower Health Emergency Rooms in Philadelphia currently clean the CT room by hand, leading to approximately 2 hours of CT scanner downtime in-between patients and possibility of human error (and the exposure of the healthcare personnel). To address this high demand for a rapid CT scan rooms/equipment disinfection process that includes COVID-19 contamination, AAPlasma LLC proposes the development of a âcoldâ plasma-activated fog-based system to achieve in-between- patient decontamination of CT scan rooms and equipment in under 30 minutes. This would allow for rapid reuse of these invaluable tools during the current COVID-19 challenge and potential future pandemics. This technology will also eliminate the possibility of human error. The technology proposed in this DOE SBIR project is based on plasma-fogging technology that has been successfully commercialized as a result of our Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) funded project (contract SP4701-20-C-0028), capable of disinfecting personal protective equipment (PPE) in 20 minutes. In the proposed project, AAPlasma will use our existing connection with the FDA to support rapid deployment of the CT scanner room disinfection system with proper classification of our technology, approved for future use. Beyond the immediate threat of COVID-19, the technology being developed throughout this project will be useful for the future events and can be used by the hospital personnel to keep the rooms clean in the future. To address the immediate issues surrounding long turnaround times for CT scanner room at numerous hospitals, AAPlasma will design, validate, and optimize a plasma system for a CT scanner disinfection prototype (Phase I), and will use results from Phase I to construct and test a hospital-ready prototype system to apply the full FDA application, with our manufacturing partner Xenex Disinfection Services (Phase II). These undertakings are further broken up into the following respective technical objectives for the Phase I period of performance: (1) 3D CFD modeling of CT room layout and air mixing with the equipment inside the room, (2) design the plasma-activated fog (PAF) disinfection process flow, (3) design the air scrubbing process following PAF disinfection, (4) system performance evaluation including power requirements and safety analysis, (5) perform material compatibility testing, and (6) Phase II planning and preparation. Successful implementation of our technology into hospitals affected with stressed demand on clean CT scanner rooms due to the COVID-19 outbreak will be able to effectively reuse this equipment and alleviate issues due to long turnaround times."

Reliability testing techniques typically expose the electronic component to elevated temperatures for a period of time to accelerate the aging mechanism. Aging testing often does not take into account the effects of prolonged exposure to the oxidative environment and to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. We propose to construct a single unit that will offer a tunable, oxidative environment, regulated temperature delivery, and UV. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) can be synthesized by gliding arc discharge (GAD) plasma and introduced onto a target sample. Non-equilibrium plasmas generate RONS that are well-known for their ability to chemically etch materials. This process is similar to that observed by normal aging effects due to long-term exposure to the chemical composition of Earthâs atmosphere. Our team has extensive experience in working with various configurations of gliding arcs for the treatment of air, water, and surfaces. For this project, AAPlasma proposes to develop a gliding arc plasma system that can reliably simulate the aging effects of circuits in order to improve the time demands observed in standard aging evaluation processes. By exposing electronics components to controlled RONS, UV, and elevated temperature we are able to rapidly and precisely simulate a wide range of aging conditions for testing of electronic components. This innovative process is expected to achieve the desired aging effects in under 75% of the currently utilized aging validation process."

These trends, if continued, place a high importance on the safety aspect of seafood trade. Despite the lack of evidence supporting higher risk in imported food, many of the U.S. seafood import sources are located in tropical areas where bacteria and toxin hazards are greater. This concern is further exacerbated by the increasing trade deficit highlighted by the 2004 USDA Seafood Safety and Trade study. In 2001 alone, the United States imported $6.8 billion more than exported. The increasing amount of aquacultural activities around the world have also led to amplified antimicrobial action and, in some instances, heavy use of antibiotics. Although most countries with a significant aquaculture industry exercise responsible controlling action, there is still some concern over prophylactic use of antibiotics, rather than anaphylactic use, increasing the potential for proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in aquacultural environments. In addition, higher stresses on aquacultural facilities driven by the growing demand for seafood has exacerbated the number of pathogens and organic toxins that threaten fish, bivalves, and other aquatic organisms of interest.
Some water treatment processes can lyse bacteria, intact remnants of pathogenic genes are often released into the environment can eventually be taken up by other cells through natural transformation. A recent study published in Water Research, supports the probability that chemical agent water treatment such as chlorination can drastically intensify eARG uptake and increase ARB transmission. Furthermore, the removal efficiency of organic toxins and antibiotics themselves during water treatment is highly variable, depending on the toxinâs physicochemical properties and the design and water treatment conditions of the aquaculture site. In the framework of this SBIR Phase I project, AAPlasma will design, develop, and evaluate a pulsed spark discharge system for its implementation in aquacultural facilities to prevent proliferation of waterborne pathogenic microbes and to dissociate antibiotics. The main goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to investigate the efficacy of direct non-thermal plasma in water to inactivate pathogenic bacteria, dissociate toxins of concern, and evaluate the potential risks of this plasma-based approach on fish and similar in-demand marine organisms."""

These species can be synthesized by dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma and carried via charged water droplets before uniformly coating the target object (in this case, the surface of PPE items) due to electrostatic effects. Working with the scientists and students at Drexel University, AAPlasma has already validated this technology for the disinfection of fresh fruits and vegetables (FF&V) during transportation and is rapidly preparing to translate this technology for PPE targets under the discretion of our hospital partners and introduce these plasma-based systems into existing hospital setting as soon as possible to support the admirable efforts of hospital personnel to slow this pandemic. In previous testing, this technology was validated to be effective and affordable while garnering industrial support from both the DoD and domestic companies within the US agricultural industry. While we were able to demonstrate effectiveness FF&V shelf life extension and a high reduction rate of several bacterial pathogens on FF&V targets, there is a need to test this technology on viruses similar to COVID-19 and optimize the technology towards the demands of hospital settings in order to benefit infection prevention operations and epidemiology as a commercial product; this is the focus of this Direct to Phase II SBIR project. AAPlasma plans to leverage successful results from Phase I and II to rapidly develop and deploy PPE decontamination systems for between-patient use within current hospital operations. Plasma fogging technology has several advantages over currently employed PPE decontamination systems, the greatest of which is turnaround time (20-30 minutes). Successful implementation of our technology into hospitals affected with stressed demand for clean PPE items due to the COVID-19 outbreak will be able to effectively reuse this equipment and alleviate issues due to PPE shortages."

The work will address some key issues in the technology development such as selection of magnitude of tapping impact, frequency, noise reduction, transducer selection and detection criteria development. The Phase I work will be divided in two sections: base effort for experimental feasibility demonstration and optional work for numerical simulation to provide guidance for further prototype development. Successful accomplishment of the Phase I and Phase I optional work will provide us with a solid background to proceed into the full scale prototype development."

The system will use a pulsed laser to excite the container and a laser Doppler vibrometer for long stand-off vibratory (ultrasonic) signal detection. The detected signals will then be sent through an attached expert system, where the wave pattern will be recognized based on criteria established through both experimental data collection and numerical simulation. The inspection system may be used by explosive ordinance disposal teams or security personnel, such as TSA officers at traffic control points, to identify the contents of sealed containers as dangerous or hazardous without having to open the vessel or use a radioactive source like a Polarized Inelastic Neutron Scattering (PINS) device. The system also has a field-upgradable reference library to treat and remember the new materials encountered.

Most cases (70-80%) present with nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) [1, 2]. Intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), which elicits a nonspecific local immune response, is considered the standard first-line treatment. However, over 50% of NMIBC will recur. Several chemotherapeutics have been explored in the second-line setting with onlylimited efficacy, forcing many patients into a radical cystectomy. Because of high disease recurrence and morbidity, the cost per bladder cancer patient is among the highest of all cancers. Thus, the development of an effective molecularly targeted intravesical therapy is highly desirable. Inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway is a promising therapy for bladder cancer [3]. In a genetically engineered mouse bladder cancer model that recapitulates the human disease (developed by our collaborators at Columbia University), mTOR expression increased with disease progression, and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin effectively prevented tumor progression when administered intravesically [4]. Furthermore, rapamycin was found to potentiate the induction of a BCG-mediated immune response in mice [5]. Thus, we believe that intravesical therapy with rapamycin may have significant therapeutic value in the treatment of NMIBC as a rational molecularly targeted therapy. A novel injectable nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin was developed (nab-rapamycin) and in various xenograft tumor models, nab-rapamycin decreased downstream signaling and showed excellent efficacy [6-8]. In a phase 1 clinical study, intravenous nab-rapamycin was safe with evidence of responses and stable disease in a variety of solid tumors [internal data]. nab-rapamycin is in the process of being licensed to AADi, LLC, a start-up company, which is the applicant for this grant. We propose to conduct a combined phase 1/2 clinical trial to assess safety, toxicity, and efficacy of local intravesical administration of nab rapamycin in patients with NMIBC that have failed BCG treatment. Our specific aims are: Phase I portion - (1) in a clinical phase 1 study, establish safety and maximum tolerated dose of intravesical nab-rapamycin, (2) in a genetically engineered mouse bladder cancer model, evaluate efficacy of the combination of intravesical nab-rapamycin and BCG; Phase II portion - (3) in patients, evaluate blood and bladder tissue levels of nab-rapamycin, (4) evaluate potential predictive clinical biomarkers, (5) evaluate efficacy/safety in a clinical phase 2 study of single agent nab-rapamycin, and (6) evaluate efficacy/safety in a phase 2 combination with BCG. This proposal will present a unique opportunity to develop the first targeted molecular therapy with nab- rapamycin for intravesical treatment of bladder cancer. Our ultimate goal is to seek FDA approval.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With approximately 70,000 new bladder cancer cases in the United States, and almost 15,000 deaths every year and because of high disease recurrence and morbidity, the cost per bladder cancer patient is among the highest of all cancers. Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is a recurrent disease and an effective molecularly targeted intravesical therapy especially after failure of first line therapy is highly desirable as there are not proven effective options for patients in this setting. The relevance of this proposal lies in its potential to provide better outcomes in patients with NMIBC that have failed standard therapies."

Current treatment regimens with toxic chemotherapeutic drugs are too long, causing poor compliance which results in reduced efficacy and the emergence of drug-resistant strains due to incomplete clearance of the infection, resulting in over 1.7 million deaths annually. The WHO has now made the elimination of TB as one of its global development goals of the millennium. The key unmet needs/wants for TB therapy are to shorten the current 6-9 month treatment duration and maintain effectiveness against multidrugresistant TB. Mycobacterial Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase B (mPTPB) is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family of enzymes. TB bacteria encourage their engulfment by host cells of the innate immune system and then 'hide' from and interfere with host immune responses inside these cells. mPTPB is actively secreted into the cytoplasm of infected macrophages, where it undermines host antibacterial defense mechanisms by blocking the production of inflammatory cytokines and preventing the execution of the infected macrophage's 'Plan B', which is to undergo apoptosis to cause death of the infected cell (and its bacterial passengers) for the good of the organism as a whole. In collaboration with our academic cofounder Zhong-Yin Zhang, Aarden has discoveredand characterized several generations of mPTPB inhibitors of increasing potency and selectivity. The most advanced compounds, the L01-Z series, exhibit low nanomolar potency against mPTPB in biochemical and cellular activity assays and display a high degree of selectivity for mPTPB. The lead compound, L01-Z08, is active in a guinea pig model of TB infection. The primary objective of the current proposal is to complete the characterization and Lead Optimization of LO1-Z08, for the treatment of TB, leading to the nomination of L01-Z08 as a clinical development candidate for TB. The secondary objective is the discovery and initial characterization of one or more families of backup compounds with diverse chemical structures. The Specific Aims of the project are: (i) To determine the precise mechanisms of action of L01-Z08 and related compounds in cellular systems by multiple biochemical and recombinant approaches and characterize the activity of mPTPB inhibitors in TB-infected macrophages in vitro (ii) To complete pharmaceutics analyses of L01-Z08 and related compounds, including in vitro ADME, CEREP screen, genetox/micronucleus assays (iii) To synthesize 50-100g of L01-Z08, complete a standard screen to identify a clinical formulation, determine oral bioavailability and perform preliminary toxicology in the rat (iv) To identify potential backup compounds from pre-existing libraries of PTP inhibitors  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The need exists for a new, breakthrough therapeutic forTB - despite the disease burden and the loss of life caused by TB, no new class of drugs has been approved for the treatment of the disease since the 1970s. Current treatment regimens with toxic chemotherapy-type drugs are a too long, causing patient to stop taking the drugs too early, which leads to the emergence of drug-resistant strains of TB. Over a third of world's population is infected with TB, resulting in over 1.7 million deaths annually, and the WHO has now made the elimination of TB as one of its global development goals of the millennium."

SARAN supports the transparent instrumentation of entire Android APKs (i.e., both DEX bytecode and native libraries). DEX bytecode is instrumented using a static binary decompilation that lifts the bytecode into an intermediate representation that facilitates program analysis and transformation. Our proposed DEX bytecode instrumentation maintains transparency by intercepting and sanitizing reflective calls and provides completeness by supporting method proxies and dynamic class loading. Native libraries are instrumented by a custom version of the DynamoRIO dynamic binary instrumentation engine. DynamoRIO operates by shifting an application's execution from its original instructions to a code cache, where the instructions can be freely, and transparently, modified.DynamoRIO occupies the address space with the application and has full control over execution, taking over whenever control leaves the code cache or when the operating system directly transfers control to the application. DynamoRIO, and the SARAN modifications, go to great lengths to maintain instrumentation transparency. Specifically, SARAN ensures library (reentrancy), heap (data layout), thread (hides extra threads) and stack transparency.

An analysis of military mishap data showed that rollovers occur less frequently than frontal and rear impacts, but have the highest rate of injury and fatality. However, there are currently no military safety standards, and only the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration static roof crush, and interior padding requirements standards to regulate rollovers. The goal of this proposed SBIR effort is the development of a suite of new, proven, rollover-specific safety tests. These tests will have the greatest potential for understanding the kinematics, and reducing the hazards, of the rollover crash situations. The research will be conducted by gathering and analyzing existing literature, tests, and tools, and will ultimately lead to improved safety in vehicle during rollovers."

Increasing these osteoprogenitor cell populations through the use of ex vivo expansion technologies and combining these cells with a matrix material may significantly increase the amount and rate of new bone formation, and replace the need for autologous grafts. Phase I studies identified expansion variables for osteoprogenitor cell expansion and showed that this process can be scaled up into the automated clinical-scale cell culture system, the AastromReplicell(r) Cell Production System (ARS). In Aim 1 of the Phase II studies, optimization of the osteoprogenitor expansion process will continue. Optimization will be measured by not only biological performance in vitro and in vivo, but also the ease of commercialization of the expansion process. Specifically, the role of other cell populations in osteoprogenitor cell expansion and function will be determined, the minimal requirements for including exogenous factors in cultures will be identified, inoculation densities and maximized feeding schedules will be determined to support expansion from small volume bone marrow aspirates, the potential for expansion in an animal serum-free environment will be examined. In Aim 2, the angiogenic potential of these same cell products will be measured in vitro by colony assay and tube formation assays, as blood vessel formation is important for optimal bone regeneration. Aim 3 will validate optimal expansion processes in the ARS and evaluate bone and vascular regeneration in vivo in an ectopic mouse model.

The potential use of these populations, referred to as marrow stromal cells (MSC), in clinical applications to treat nonhematopoietic disorders is being intensely investigated. Ex vivo expansion is being used to increase the number of multipotent MSC available for cell and gene therapy applications. There are currently no standardized methodologies for the culture of these cells, however plating and culturing cell densities have been found to be critical in maintaining the multipotentiality of these cells. Aastrom has previously developed a proprietary single-pass perfusion (SPP) process that has successfully expands BM stem cells with demonstrated engraftment capability in humans. This process technology has been effectively implemented in an automated clinical culture system, the AastromReplicell (tm) Cell Production System (ARS), which enables cells to be produced in a single step process without pre-selection or step-cultures. The culture chamber of this system, along with the operating system software, can both be modified to apply for the growth of other cell types. Using this platform technology, the overall goal of the proposed studies is to develop a GMP compliant automated SPP culture process for the generation of large numbers of highly functional MSC suitable for clinical use. This process will be reliable and reproducible, and the unique combination of SPP and closed system automation should allow MSC production under GMP conditions with minimal manipulation. In Phase I, basic culture parameters known to significantly effect adherent cell proliferation and differentiation will be defined in small-scale cultures to optimize the number of functional MSC produced. MSC will be identified by flow cytometry, colony assays, and differentiation assays. Plastic surface characteristics, including roughness, patterning, and tissue-culture treatment, will be defined. Next, several serum-free media formulations and surface coatings will be examined. Initial studies on the effects of medium perfusion and oxygenation levels will also be performed.

For cell therapy to be practical in a clinical setting, simple, efficient, GMP compliant methods for cell production are needed. Aastrom has previously developed a single-pass perfusion (SPP) bioreactor technology, the AastromReplicell TM Cell Production System (ARS), designed for automated expansion of primary human cells for clinical use. In previous studies, SPP technology has been shown to enhance function and overall production of several cell types. Based on this technology, we will develop a GMP I compliant method for the ex vivo production of substantial numbers of EPC from a small volume of BM for use in cell therapy applications. First, we will identify and optimize EPC cell culture parameters in our small-scale SPP culture system. Parameters to be examined will include starting cell population, medium serum concentration, culture duration, starting cell density and frequency of medium exchange. EPC will be enumerated and output analyzed by immunostaining and in vitro assays. Optimal culture conditions from Aim 1 will be evaluated in an in vivo model for hind limb ischemia in Aim 2. Concurrently, we will begin studies in Aim 3 to develop the EPC culture process(es) in the clinical-scale ARS. Based on small-scale results, potential revisions to the current ARS platform technology will include cell bed surface modifications and software updates to accommodate optimized medium perfusion rates. These modifications will be made with the help of in-house engineers and product specialists. Cell output from the ARS will be compared to cell output from small-scale cultures. With the successful completion of Phase I studies, a Phase II program will involve continued culture optimization and in vivo evaluations of the expanded cell products in both small-scale and clinical-scale cultures to optimize the ARS for large-scale clinical trial commercialization. Once the ARS process is established, a clinical trial will be initiated for the treatment of vascular disease. Studies will also be initiated to develop EPC gene transfer protocols within the context of the ARS platform.

S. is expected to grow from a current rate of 15,000 per year to over 100,000 per year by 1995. This rapid expansion is due to the diversity in the types of bone marrow transplantation procedures and the number of clinical procedures that can be benefitted by a BMT. Major limiting factors in BMT therapy is the high cell number that is needed for reingraftment, traumatic procedure needed for cell aspiration, and the poor capability to handle cells ex vivo. Cells are basically frozen during ex vivo storage. Thus, significant need exists for the development of ex vivo hematopoietic cell expansion technologies. We have developed cell culture conditions under which human hematopoietic cells expand ex vivo. Based on this discovery, we wish to develop clinically useful systems to improve BMT procedures. The first step in the development of a clinical-scale system is to make small hematopoietic bioreactor systems that mimic and successfully reproduce the expansive cell culture conditions. We will develop and optimize such a prototype hematopoietic bioreactor system with Phase I funding. If Phase I goals are successfully met, we will pursue a Phase II study to develop clinically useful prototypes."

Mature cells are continuously produced from progenitor (or precursor) cells. Consequently, assays which detect these progenitor cells are vital in many research and clinical settings. The current assay procedures suffer from a number of shortcomings. First, they are carried out under suboptimal conditions which do not represent the in vivo environment. As a result, the assays are slow and the results may not be physiologically relevant. Furthermore, many current assay techniques do not ensure clonality; thereby, they preclude the harvest and study of the progeny of a single cell. Finally, most assays allow accessory cell interactions, and this often obscures the true action of the activity being assayed. These drawbacks can be overcome by the use of microencapsulation and rapid perfusion. We will demonstrate that single progenitor cells can be grown out clonally in a microcapsule. If this ability is demonstrated, then in Phase II the detailed dynamics of outgrowth, including kinetics, lineage reconstitution, and expansion of immature hematopoietic cells, will be established. This assay will be made available on a contract basis for growth factor screening, drug efficacy testing, toxicology studies and as a radiation assay."

Currently, $40b- $60b of tax payer dollars is spent in academic research. Yet, 80% of inventions that arise from this investment in academic research do not impact society as product(s) or revenue. The key deficiencies of current processes include, costly and time-consuming decision-making, and lack of training, education and work-flow. This ultimately has resulted in lack of best practices in academic innovation management. This project would result in products that would educate and cross- train inventors and invention managers, would produce automated and appropriate decisions for every invention and would streamline workflow, thus defining best-practices for the industry. This project would have several positive impacts, including lowering costs and increasing business partnerships for academic inventions. Such increase in business partnerships would increase products and revenue. Thus, as a result of this project, the potential of dormant inventions would be realized, which would in-turn creates jobs and fuel reinvestment into the innovation economy. Thus the product would leverage the billions invested in academic research. This project proposes to build a product for automated invention management and decision-making. The decision-making is empowered by information or data aggregated from disparate sources in several domains as well as by assimilation of personnel insights. This is accomplished by the design that allows collection of data from several sources in multiple domains and providing the most relevant data to the user in the context of the invention. The mathematical modeling used to develop the decision-making technology is based on objective criteria rather than on subjective criteria. The product resulting from this project will be hosted in the cloud with unique access points to several layers of users. The user-interfaces and the analytical output will be customized to the type of user. Moreover, the design accommodates multiple users at the different layers and will serve as a web-portal for collaboration. The overall goal of the research project is to provide an automated innovation decision-making product that is customizable to suit the risk profiles of different academic innovation centers. The goal of the Phase I project is to build a proof-of-concept product that can undergo testing."

The skeletal muscle wasting that occurs with cancer cachexia compromises
quality of life and is both directly and indirectly responsible for cancer mortalities. Tumor-derived and
tumor-responsive factors as well as many therapeutics themselves contribute to the cachectic state,
although nutritional support has little if any positive effect on restoring striated muscle mass or function.
Thus, novel tools for preventing muscle wasting in cancer patients could transform their treatment and
significantly improve their quality of life. Our research objective is to test a novel gene therapeutic for
enhancing muscle regeneration in a mouse model of tumor- and chemotherapy-induced cachexia and in
addition, to complete the GLP/toxicology studies required for IND filing. We hypothesize that attenuating
the intracellular signaling pathways responsible for muscle atrophy and impaired muscle regeneration will
in turn restore muscle mass and function and significantly delay mortality. In fact, Phase I-equivalent
data indicate that attenuating ActRIIB and Smad2/3 signaling with rAAV6:Smad7 (a.k.a. AVGN7)
significantly enhances muscle mass and function in wild-type mice and can completely prevent muscle
atrophy in different mouse models of cancer cachexia. Most importantly, this therapeutic does not
produce the serious off-target effects that have compromised development of competing technologies
that have either been shown to compromise blood vessel integrity or to possess this potential. Our
specific aims are to (i) test the hypothesis that rAAV6:Smad7 can prevent cancer- and chemotherapy-
induced muscle wasting, (ii) test the hypothesis that rAAV6:Smad7 reduces cancer mortality and (iii)
complete murine and non-human primate toxicology studies with rAAV6:Smad7. The proposed
approach is truly innovative as it utilizes a novel gene therapeutic and state-of-the art tools to
comprehensively assess muscle function at different scales. These studies are also highly significant as
they will provide a better mechanistic understanding of how tumor- and chemotherapy-induced muscle
wasting are independently affected by ActRIIB and Smad2/3 signaling. Most importantly, these
translational studies have the very real potential to impact clinical medicine and to advance clinical trials
of rAAV6:Smad7.RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH. The striated muscle wasting that occurs with cancer cachexia
compromises quality of life and is both directly and indirectly responsible for cancer mortalities. The
proposed studies will develop a novel gene therapy for preventing this wasting, whether it results from
tumor burden or chemotherapy. These studies will also advance the gene therapy towards clinical trials
by completing the required toxicology studies."

Abalone Bio will develop antibody (Ab) drugs that inhibit intestinal inflammation to treat inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD). IBD comprises chronic, debilitating, idiopathic inflammatory diseases that result in severe dam-
age to the gut wall, including Crohnandapos;s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The primary etiology is chronic
inflammation, which causes pain, diarrhea, weight loss, fever, bleeding ulcers, fistulas, and abscesses in the
abdomen and perianal region, and CD patients develop obstructive intestinal fibrosis that must be surgically
removed. There is an unmet need for long-acting, broadly applicable disease-modifying, and pain-reliev-
ing IBD therapies. There are currently immunomodulators effective as disease-modifying therapies; however,
some patients do not respond to them, they have adverse side effects, and their efficacies wane over time. To
address this need, we used our proprietary Ab discovery platform to identify first-of-their-kind Ab agonists for a
G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), the cannabinoid receptor CB2. CB2 has immunomodulatory functions in
many diseases that affect several body systems. In humans, CB2 is constitutively expressed in immune cells,
and its expression is broadly induced in IBD, including in the colon. Consistently, CB2 function has been firmly
linked to IBD: (1) CB2-KO mice are more susceptible to IBD in disease models, and (2) a common partial loss-
of-function CB2 allele has been associated with increased risk of IBD in humans. CB2 agonism has limited
adverse effects, and it can suppress inflammation in the gut and elsewhere, and, in contrast to CB1
agonism, it is not psychoactive. Abaloneâs CB2-specific agonist Abs have many advantages over small-mole-
cule CB2 agonist drug candidates, including CNS exclusion and high specificity, which minimize CB1 activation.
Furthermore, Abs are natural proteins; thus, they are unlikely to have unexpected adverse effects due to chem-
ical by-products. We will test the hypothesis that Abaloneâs CB2 agonist Abs are feasible pre-clinical IBD thera-
peutic candidates with anti-inflammatory effects. Our three major aims are (1) to engineer, produce, and char-
acterize CB2 agonist Ab variants based on previously isolated and characterized agonist hits; (2) to eval-
uate the anti-inflammatory activity of these CB2 agonist Abs on human immune cells; and (3) to assess
the effects of the top CB2 agonist Abs in two complementary IBD mouse models. Successful completion
of this Phase I project will validate this strategy for the treatment of IBD and will pave the way for further devel-
opment of these Ab drugs. Although this SBIR application focuses on IBD, Abaloneâs CB2 agonist Ab drugs are
applicable to other inflammatory, chronic pain, and fibrotic diseases. Compared with small-molecule drugs, bio-
logics have an excellent safety record, which supports development and approval for clinical trials and increased
odds of marketing.NARRATIVE
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are idiopathic, debilitating disorders caused by chronic intestinal inflamma-
tion, and life-disrupting symptoms include pain, diarrhea, weight loss, fever, bleeding ulcers, fistulas, abscesses
in the abdomen, and release of blood and mucus. While there are IBD therapeutics, some patients do not re-
spond to them, most have adverse side effects, and their efficacies wane over time. In this Phase I project,
Abalone Bio will develop innovative and highly specific CB2 antibody agonists that do not cross the blood-brain
barrier, making them safer and more effective IBD therapeutics with fewer side effects than small-molecule CB2
agonists currently in clinical trials."

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is an often long-lasting neurological condition that arises
frequently in cancer patients who receive broadly used chemotherapies such as taxanes. CIPN causes abnormal
pain and other symptoms that can limit chemotherapy dosage and significantly impact quality of life for years.
There are no drugs that prevent CIPN or treat it well. Duloxetine is the only clinically proven efficacious pain-
reducing agent, though it can cause significant side effects and its efficacy limited to a subset of patients. Opioids
are used off-label, but also carry serious side effects. Thus, there is a critical unmet need for drugs that safely
and effectively treat or prevent CIPN. Peripheral Cannabinoid 2 receptors (CB2) are a promising target for CIPN
treatment. CB2 is constitutively expressed on inflammatory immune cells and induced in peripheral neurons in
neuropathic conditions. Its activation has powerful neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects.
Rodent models of CIPN show that small molecule CB2 agonists alleviate neuropathic pain behavior, and when
administered prophylactically suppress CIPN both during dosing and for 100 days after. Several companies have
developed small molecule CB2 agonists that, unfortunately, are rapidly cleared, penetrate the blood-brain barrier
and/or have off-target effects (notably cognitive ones) mediated by the CB1 receptor. Abalone Bio used its
proprietary Functional Antibody Selection Technology (FAST) to isolate a selective CB2-activating nanobody
(VHH), which we converted into a VHH-Fc fusion lead antibody, ABt140, for in vivo studies. Phase I SBIR results
show that ABt140 rapidly and durably reversed allodynia in mice with CIPN. In this Phase II SBIR project,
Abalone Bio will first improve ABt140âs immunogenicity and manufacturability by rational engineering, and then
the FAST platform will be used to increase its potency to select durable agonists from millions of computationally-
designed variants. We will select 1 lead and at least 2 alternates using in vitro and in vivo assays. Using the
paclitaxel CIPN mouse model, we will assess the leadâs ability to prevent CIPN development, reduce in nerve
damage and inflammation, show no impairment of motor skills, and not affect chemotherapyâs anti-tumor
efficacy. Finally, we will determine the lead antibodyâs half-life and tissue distribution in mice, and using blood
markers and organs appearance and weight, we will assess its toxicity at high doses. Successful completion of
these aims will de-risk the project sufficiently to advance Abaloneâs antibody drug to IND-enabling studies and
eventually first in human trials for painful CIPN. Abaloneâs drug may also have broad utility for other neuropathic
pains and inflammatory conditions.NARRATIVE

Cirrhosis of the liver is among the top ten leading causes of death in the US, with more than 35,000 deaths
each year. A major underlying cause of cirrhosis is liver injury associated with liver fibrosis; the pathological
indication of cirrhosis is the development of scar tissue that replaces normal parenchyma. The scar tissue
blocks the flow of blood through the liver, raising blood pressure and disturbing normal function.
Current drugs that treat fibrosis are not always effective. Patients are often left with âlifestyle modificationsâ that
are difficult to sustain, and, at best, put patients in a race against disease progression. Small molecule agonists
of the cannabinoid receptor CB2 have reduced liver fibrosis in several established animal models. CB2
agonists achieve this by inhibiting hepatic immune cells and hepatic stellate cells. CB2 agonism is a
promising mode of action for treating liver fibrosis. However, small molecule CB2 agonists have
drawbacks that undercut their effectiveness and safety, including cross-reactivity with CB1, crossing the blood-
brain barrier and cross-activating CB1, causing the adverse cognitive effects of cannabinoids and rapid
elimination from the body. A highly specific CB2 agonist antibody that is long-lived and restricted to
peripheral tissues would be an ideal drug to test the CB2 agonism mode of action.
Abalone Bio proposes 3 aims to test the feasibility of using CB2 agonist antibody drugs to treat liver fibrosis.
(1) Engineer, produce, characterize CB2 agonist antibodies. VHH-Fc versions of identified hits will be made and
characterized using multiple non-liver in vitro cell-based assays. (2) Assess effects of CB2 agonist antibodies
on liver cells. In this aim, the antibodies from Aim 1 will be used to characterize anti-fibrotic effects in primary
liver cells and stable liver cell lines in vitro. The data will bridge receptor pharmacology in standard cell lines
with in vivo data from Aim 3 and can validate and expand biomarkers for fibrosis. (3) Assess anti-fibrotic effects
of a CB2 agonist antibody in an in vivo model of liver fibrosis (with leading liver fibrosis expert and Consortium
PI, Dr. Scott Friedman). This aim will test the feasibility of using CB2 agonism to treat liver fibrosis in
thioacetamide rat models by measuring the effects of the antibody on blood markers, collagen levels,
histopathology metrics, and gene expression.
Success in the Phase I project will lead to a safe and effective drug for liver fibrosis, increase scientific
understanding of liver disease, and define non-invasive biomarkers to monitor disease progression. Phase II
(including IND-enabling studies) will involve selecting and optimizing a lead antibody, with a focus on good
clinical and manufacturing attributes. This research will enable Abalone Bio to expand the impact of its CB2
antibody agonist drugs to other diseases involving fibrosis and inflammation, e.g., skin and lung diseases such
as scleroderma and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Narrative
A major underlying cause of cirrhosis is liver injury associated with liver fibrosis, which involves the
development of scar tissue that blocks the flow of blood through the liver, disturbing normal liver function.
There are no approved drugs to treat liver fibrosis, and unapproved treatments are not always effective. In this
Phase I project, Abalone Bio will develop an innovative cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) antibody agonist
therapeutic that is naturally restricted to peripheral tissues by the blood-brain barrier and very specific for CB2,
enabling a safe, effective antifibrogenic therapy for liver fibrosis with fewer side effects than CB2 small
molecules agonists in clinical trials."

The goal is to use antibodies to increase or decrease the activity of a type of cell signaling receptor called ""G protein-coupled receptors"" (GPCRs). There are more than 400 non-olfactory human GPCRs that are involved in all aspects of health and disease, including cancers, autoimmune diseases, pain, inflammation, and others. About 25% of GPCRs have been targeted by approved small molecule drugs, but efforts for the remaining have often failed because of the inability of small molecules to distinguish between similar GPCRs. Antibody drugs can overcome this hurdle because of their much higher specificity for their targets. This project will bring to commercialization the first technology that directly identifies antibodies that modulate GPCR function. These antibodies will impact healthcare by enabling therapies for diseases with poor or no current treatments. They also will impact scientific understanding by enabling the study of GPCR-related physiology and disease. The commercial impacts are potentially very large. The GPCR drug market is over $100B, and most antibody therapeutics have annual sales over $1B. The platform described here could enable dozens of novel GPCR antibody therapeutics, creating value for patients, society, and co-development partners. The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop a drug discovery technology for discovering antibodies that modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Current methods are limited because GPCR antigens are often not properly folded, and because antibodies are selected by how tightly they bind GPCRs, rather than by the effect they exert. Those that bind typically do not have any effect at all. This project will build on the successful proof-of-concept from Phase I that demonstrated the platform's ability to identify directly functional antibody agonists for a human GPCR. The proposal addresses the four main technical requirements that pharmaceutical customers cite as important: Ability to work on many types of GPCRs, ability to isolate antibodies with varied modulating effects, use of a highly diverse, high-quality scFv library, and a workflow that can quickly isolate, optimize and characterize dozens of candidates. The goals of this project are to improve how the platform's yeasts express GPCRs and functionally couple them to different selectable readouts, construct a proprietary scFv library, and optimize the workflow by incorporating sequencing bioinformatics and antibody characterization, including flow cytometric analysis of cell-binding and functional assays on cultured mammalian cells. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These therapies act by increasing or decreasing the activity of a type of cell signaling receptor, ""G protein-coupled receptors"" (GPCRs). Antibodies are highly specific for their targets, an important characteristic for GPCR drugs, as GPCRs comprise a large family of structurally similar proteins. In fact, small molecule drugs for GPCRs often are toxic due to side effects from acting on structurally similar but functionally unrelated GPCRs. This project will develop the first technology that directly identifies antibodies by their ability to modulate GPCR function. These antibodies will impact society's health by treating currently incurable diseases, and strongly impact scientific understanding by enabling the study of GPCR-related mammalian physiology and disease. The commercial impacts are potentially very large. The global GPCR drug market is over $100B, and over half of marketed antibody therapeutics have annual sales of over $1B. The platform described here has the potential to develop many GPCR antibody therapeutics, and thereby generate an enormous amount of value for patients, society at large, and co-development partners. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a platform for discovering GPCR-modulating antibodies. This platform could be critical for generating tools for studying GPCR-related biology and disease, and for developing therapeutics with fewer side effects than small molecule drugs to treat GPCR-related diseases. Developing functional GPCR antibodies using traditional methods is encumbered by the difficulty in producing antigens that represent the GPCR in a functional state, and a lack of high-throughput assays of GPCR function. The proposed platform and method expresses human GPCRs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast, couples activity to selectable phenotypes, and directly selects antibodies that modulate GPCR function in the same cells. The first objective aims to further characterize the activity and specificity of camelid antibodies (""nanobodies"") antagonists that inhibit the endogenous yeast GPCR, Ste2, and then perform agonist selections to identify at least one Ste2 agonist. The second objective aims to further develop the platform to enable interrogating a broader array of human GPCR targets using ScFv antibody libraries, and to identify at least one agonist or antagonist of a therapeutically relevant human GPCR. Positive results will demonstrate the feasibility of the platform."

This effort will investigate new mechanisms for automated correlation testing through a fundamental approach which begins by identifying the problems inherent with achieving fair fight and interoperability. The effort continues by defining metrics to be used in capturing individual correlation measures in the areas of terrain database physical representation and terrain services functionality. These correlation measures are aggregated to develop a high level correlation scoring system. Finally, this effort will look into a configurable mechanism where users can specify the measures, the relative weight or priorities of the measures, and the failure criteria for correlation testing and reporting."

The proposal is titled: Gene Expression Exon Array Biomarkers to Diagnose Schizophrenia . The National Institute of Mental Health is specifically seeking the development of biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. AbaStar MDx's long term aim is the development of a novel, innovative, commercially-viable means of genetically diagnosing and differentiating schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) from normal/healthy individuals (NC) with mRNA gene expression signatures from a blood sample. Results will address significant clinical issues, provide faster and more accurate diagnoses, add to the understanding of shared and unique pathophysiologies of each disorder. Future success in this effort may alter medical treatment by providing more effective drugs, appropriate early interventions for mental disorders. The specific objective of this pilot study is to demonstrate predictive and, consistent surrogate biomarkers to diagnose SZ with dysregulated mRNA gene expression signature from blood samples at three different time points over three months. We have shown, in NC, 20% of the RNA transcripts measured on Affymetrix exon array were not significantly changed over nine consecutive blood draws time points over 54 hours. The remaining 80% were changed significantly. Well-known episodic nature of the disease might lead to highly variable results depending on when blood is collected in relation to the severity of the disease/symptoms. Variables, such as time of day of the sample collection, day to day variability might have an impact on the expression profile. Also another challenge addressed is that several researchers have confirmed dysregulated RNA genes in blood sample of SZ compared to NC. However, the SZ gene sets don't overlap from one study to the next and to date all samples were collected at one time point. The study would reveal variability of alternative splicing and confirm that we have the best set of biomarker genes for diagnostic product development. These criticisms from prior submissions have been addressed with this study with multiple blood draws from the same individuals over longer time periods to show consistency of the proposed RNA screen. If successful, this unique diagnostic could address a significant clinical problem and lead to the first blood based test for SZ. We will continue to standardize the experimental process, analyze RNA gene expression data, along with covariates and establish the most consistent possible RNA gene expression biomarker set. These chronic dysregulated gene sets for the disorder can be identified in this proposal (and validated in future studies) with these proposed association studies. This will be accomplished by: Enrolling well characterized chronic SZ patients, ages 18-45 with SZ (n=30) and NC (n=30) subjects at one clinical sites in an institutional review board (IRB) approved clinical study; Conducting clinical assessment then collect whole blood samples from SZ and NC subjects at 3- visits, over 3 months; Extracting high quality RNA from the whole blood samples and measuring RNA gene expression using on Affymetrix exon array; Analyzing statistically RNA gene expression data and alternative splicing, along with covariates throughout to control for the likely effects of cell specific expression, psychiatric symptom assessment scales, clinical lab tests, medications, smoking, drug abuse, ethnic, gender, from three time points; and At the Conclusion: Upon completion of Aims, we expect to have identified a set of mRNA transcripts in SZ that are consistently dysregulated compared to NC overtime and thus are best potential biomarkers to develop diagnostic products. The final commercialized products derived from this approach after validation of the biomarker signatures will be CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) lab tests ordered by psychiatrists, and ultimately FDA-approved diagnostic kits for use in hospitals and clinical reference labs. This technological innovation will revolutionize diagnoses and therapy for many types of mental disorders, saving lives, ameliorating morbidity, and rewarding patients with substantially better care.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: AbaStar MDx RFA-OD-09-009, (R43), SBIR - Gene Expression Exon Array Biomarkers to Diagnose Schizophrenia Project Narrative The proposed effort is to demonstrate predictive and consistent surrogate biomarkers to diagnose SZ with dysregulated mRNA gene expression signature from blood samples at three different time points over three months. We expect to have identified a set of mRNA transcripts in SZ that are consistently dysregulated compared to NC over time. This will provide the best potential biomarkers to develop diagnostic products. This will establish new standards for treatment decisions for the 2.5 million American adults diagnosed with SZ. This technological innovation will revolutionize diagnoses and therapy for many types of mental disorders.

If successful, this transforming development will establish a revolutionary platform to address the myriad of other mental disorders affecting 57 million Americans for which no 'objective' clinical test yet exists."

The material can be hardened to above Rockwell 60, has much better corrosion resistance than austenitic or martensitic stainless steels, weights 15% less than steel and can flex a full 5% without any permanent deformation. Originally discovered by Dr. William Buehler of the Naval Research Laboratory fifty years ago, development was abandoned when insurmountable problems were encountered with cast material. To overcome the difficulties with cast material, Abbott Ball Company has devised a method of manufacturing Nitinol 60 using powder metal techniques. Working with NASA, we have made spheres, bearing races, and various other parts to characterize the material. The Nitinol 60 balls tested lower on coefficient of friction than other known bearing materials and durability tests proved that parts made of the material will stand up to vigorous use. We propose to solve the gear and corrosion problems being encountered by the Navy and others by making gears and ball bearings from Nitinol 60. NASA, among many other businesses, has pledged to support our efforts and complete materials characterization using parts supplied by Abbott. Additionally, Wedeven Laboratory has a large data bank on the existing materials and will run tests to evaluate the suitability of Nitinol 60 for gear and ball bearing applications."

Testing has been done by NASA, Timken, Kamatics and others. Our preliminary results demonstrate the superior corrosion resistance, resistance to wear, and low coefficient of friction in ball bearing applications. Since both Nickel and Titanium are expensive materials, present applications are limited to special needs applications. We noted early on that the material can be easily layered to produce a finished part which has better characteristics than either layered material. By developing a layered, composite material, cost would be substantially reduced and the material would be tougher. Aircraft engine and liftbox bearings will not only have immunity to corrosion and superior tribological characteristics on the working surfaces, but will also be competitive in cost.

deaths projected for 2020. Substantial progress in cancer treatment has been made in the past two decades,
largely through the development of highly targeted therapies, including development of antibody-drug conjugates
(ADCs). ADCs employ monoclonal antibodies with specificity for tumor-associated antigens to increase the
efficiency and selectivity of the delivery of anti-cancer toxins (i.e., payloads) to cancer cells. Although this
approach has proven to be successful, with 8 anti-cancer ADCs approved for use in the US (brentuximab vedotin,
trastuzumab emtansine, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, inotuzumab ozogamicin, polatuzumab vedotin, enfortumab
vedotin, trastuzumab deruxtecan, and sacituzumab govitecan), ADC therapies are often associated with
substantial off-target toxicity, narrow therapeutic windows, and high failure rates in clinical testing. Consideration
of the FDA-approved ADCs shows that these agents often allow a modest extension in average survival time,
but they very rarely cure a patient from their cancer. The development of adverse events prevents the
administration of ADC at dosages that are necessary to achieve tumor eradication. This project pursues a new
strategy to increase the tumor-selectivity of antibody-directed delivery of anti-cancer drugs. In our approach,
payload-binding antibody fragments, termed payload-binding selectivity enhancers (PBSE), are co-administered
with ADCs to decrease the exposure of healthy tissues to payload agents, thereby reducing the development of
off-target toxicity, increasing the tolerable dose of ADCs, and increasing ADC efficacy. The strategy is based on
the recognition that off-site ADC toxicity is primarily attributed to the released (âfreeâ) payload molecule, and also
on the hypothesis that PBSE may be employed to prevent cellular entry of free payload molecules in non-targeted
cells (by preventing diffusion across plasma membranes) without altering entry of ADCs into targeted cells (which
proceeds via receptor mediated endocytosis). Work on this project focuses on lead optimization for newly
developed anti-SN38 PBSE, which are expected to increase the safety and efficacy of SN38 ADC, including
sacituzumab govitecan. The project will develop optimized derivatives of our lead anti-SN38 PBSE, evaluate the
PBSE constructs for plasma, tissue, and tumor disposition, and conduct assessments of safety and efficacy in
mice bearing human breast cancer xenografts. In sum, work proposed in this Phase 1 project will enable the
identification of an optimized lead anti-SN38 PBSE, which will then advance through IND-enabling preclinical
investigations.Narrative
This project develops anti-SN38 antibody fragments for use as an adjunctive therapy to
decrease the toxicity of antibody-SN38 conjugates. The strategy introduced in this proposal, and
the optimized anti-SN38 agent to be developed, may be expected to increase the safety and
efficacy of SN38 antibody-drug conjugates, including sacituzumab govitecan. It is anticipated
that anti-SN38 and sacituzumab govitecan will be used as a combination therapy to treat
patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, which is associated with very poor
prognosis."

mortality rate between approximately 3-10% in adults and 12-25% in elderly patients in the United States.
Furthermore, pneumococcal disease devastates resource-poor countries, causing an estimated 476,000
people to succumb to pneumococcal infection annually (~32% of vaccine-preventable deaths in children below
age five). The most effective vaccines, polysaccharide protein conjugates, require a complicated process of
collecting polysaccharide antigens from pneumococci serotypes and conjugating them to a protein adjuvant.
Abcombi Biosciences has developed a pneumococcal vaccine using liposomal encapsulation of
polysaccharides (LEPS), which has demonstrated conjugate-like efficacy against 70+ serotypes of S.
pneumoniae via animal challenge models and opsonophagocytosis activity (OPA). Since receiving our prior
Phase I SBIR award, Abcombi Biosciences has completed all proposed milestones to address concerns
regarding the risk for potential negative side effects associated with the LEPS vaccineâs formulation.
Completion of this work has led to the development of a second generation LEPS vaccine. The enclosed
Direct Phase II SBIR proposal outlines the remaining preclinical studies necessary to reach our next major
milestone, a pre-IND meeting with the FDA. The completion of these studies will serve to address
important considerations of the FDA regarding vaccine manufacturing and characterization (i.e., chemistry
manufacturing and controls, CMC) and efficacy (i.e., the animal rule). Briefly, these studies will involve the
completion the following key developmental steps: 1) optimization of our encapsulation process for all
pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides (CPSs), 2) finalization of polysaccharide dosage, 3) evaluation of
vaccine stability, and 4) a repeated-dose toxicology study in mice and rabbits. Optimization of our
polysaccharide encapsulation process will be achieved by systematically varying our process conditions
across all 24 polysaccharides to ensure efficient and consistent encapsulation for each antigen. Upon
optimizing this process, we will then identify the optimal dosage of polysaccharide by measuring antibody
titers and OPA assay performance to determine the dosage of each polysaccharide required for sufficient
immunogenicity. We will then characterize the LEPS vaccine stability by evaluating protein pH and thermal
stability as well as the integrity of the liposomes when stored over 12 months. Lastly, we will evaluate
the vaccine for toxicity in a repeated dose study in mice and rabbits. Throughout the duration of this
study, serum will be collected to evaluate organ toxicity and quantify antibody titers. In addition, post-mortem
tissue samples will be extracted to visualize histopathology. Successful completion of this work will
prepare our vaccine candidate for a pre-IND meeting with the FDA and ensure a smooth transition into
clinical trials.PROJECT NARRATIVEThe proposed Direct Phase II SBIR project will finalize the formulation of Abcombi Bioscienceâs
liposome-based pneumococcal vaccine candidate to pre-IND meeting readiness. Success will achieve the

Water metal contamination is a ubiquitous problem due to the many industrialized processes that drive our economy. Examples include mining drainage, metal plating, semiconductor fabrication, and solar cell production. These examples straddle well-established and emerging industries but each pose significant environmental impact due to metal contamination potential. Furthermore, the loss of the associated metals carries an economic consequence as un-recovered material represents a significant missed opportunity in raw material utilization. The proposed technology in this Phase I project is poised to address these concerns. The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to produce a novel metal binding compound and to scale-up the water-metal removal prototypes based upon this compound. The project will develop a production system for producing a small molecule natural product capable of binding metal compounds with high affinity. This compound will be bound to a solid matrix which enables a heterogeneous means of removing metal content from contaminated water samples. Existing small-scale production and water treatment prototypes will be subjected to cellular and process engineering to scale up for water treatment applications. This scaling step is considered crucial to establishing the viability of the overall technology and approach. Metabolic engineering strategies will be utilized to improve cellular production of the metal binding compound. Process engineering will be applied to scale production of the compound and to assess subsequent packed-bed column operations designed to continuously remove metals from water samples. The team will work closely with a local metal plating company to demonstrate the technology with field wastewater samples.

The primary objective of this project is to establish the in vivo therapeutic potential for a new approach to treating
melanoma. Malignant melanoma is a lethal form of skin cancer resulting from the uncontrolled proliferation of
melanocytes. Melanoma is an aggressive malignancy that frequently metastasizes beyond its primary site,
making the disease more difficult to treat. Prognosis following metastasis is grim and median survival, even with
state-of-the-art immunotherapy treatment is less than one year. The current FDA-approved immune checkpoint
inhibitors nivolumab and ipilimumab have produced compelling results, however they are known to cause
significant adverse effects and only produce clinical benefit in a subset of patients. Barriers to advancing safer
and more effective stand-alone or adjuvant immune checkpoint therapies include difficulty identifying appropriate
target molecules with the potency and specificity to mount an immune response against cancer cells without
triggering of tumor escape. Abcuro has identified and characterized a protein cell surface marker for T cells
exhibited in the tumor microenvironment that aligns directly with the degree of T cell differentiation and is highly
exhibited in melanoma-derived tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. We have developed a monoclonal antibody
against this inhibitory receptor which we postulate is capable of precipitating an immune checkpoint blockade on
natural killer and T cells to reactivate effector T cell response against cancer cells. In this proposal we aim to
test whether two lead antibodies against the inhibitory receptor will result in amelioration of tumor pathology in
an animal model relevant to clinical human melanoma. To accomplish this, we will produce and characterize
recombinant humanized antibodies and measure the effect of antibody blockade of the target in a human
peripheral blood cell reconstituted immunodeficient murine melanoma model. In this way we are able to test the
efficacy of antibodies in reducing tumor growth and increasing survival in vivo using human lymphocytes. The
proposed project will establish animal proof of concept for Abcuroâs engineered antibodies in a murine
humanized melanoma model. If successful, we will have produced direct proof-of-concept evidence of the effect
of targeted blockade of this T cell activating co-inhibitory receptor for the treatment of melanoma, allowing us to
further develop our fully characterized lead antibody for clinical trials in human patients.NARRATIVE
Malignant melanoma is a type of skin cancer that results from overgrowth of pigment-producing cells and which
carries an extremely poor prognosis. We propose to develop a therapeutic antibody capable of modulating T
cells to reactivate the immune response against tumor growth. We will test our antibodies in an animal model of
melanoma that mimics the human immune system. This work will establish the potential of a novel antibody
capable of blocking mechanisms of tumor escape, opening new possibilities for cancer patients unresponsive to
currently available treatments."

The advent of fluorescent labeling technologies plus the plethora of sophisticated light
microscope techniques now available make studying dynamic processes in living cells almost commonplace. The ability to visualize, track, and quantify molecules and events in living cells with high spatial and temporal resolution is essential for understand
ing biological systems. The precise understanding of the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative processes could lead to new biological targets for developing leading new drugs that can be effectively used for the ultimate cure of these diseases. In neur
ological sciences, for example, understanding the translocation of proteins, or protein complexes, from one subcellular location to another is an important aspect for effectively developing novel drugs for various neurodegenerative diseases. Live-cell fluo
rescence imaging (in particular, high content analysis), however, is seriously limited by the availability of photostable fluorescent probes. The existing fluorescent probes are not appropriate for long- term live-cell imaging and tracing due to their poor
 photostability. Additionally, these probes are quite toxic to cells if used at high concentrations. Recently, quantum dots (Qdots) that are made from fluorescent semiconductor materials have been proposed for live-cell imaging due to their extremely high
photostability. However, their huge size seriously affects the activities of the biological target molecules that are tagged. Uniformity and reproducibility of Qdot labeling have been very challenging. Some of these fluorescent probes require excitation ne
ar UV wavelength that cause cell damage and early apoptosis and prevent these probes from being useful for long-term live-cell imaging. ABD Bioquest will collaborate with the Southern Research Institute to develop novel perylene-based fluorescent probes, w
hich have the following properties, for live cell imaging. 1) Small molecular weight. 2) Minimal toxic to cells. 3) High intensity emission with narrow bandwidth. 4) High photostability. 5) Visible wavelength (prefer near to red) excitation. 6) Easy conjug
ation with antibodies. Two specific aims will be addressed in this Phase I application. Specific Aim 1: Design, synthesize and characterize novel perylene-based fluorescent dyes Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the perylene dye&#039;s feasibility for live cell immunofl
uorescence imaging. The successful completion of these aims will produce a powerful fluorescent probe that can be used for exploring novel applications of high content analysis and screening in live cells."

A variety of techniques including interferometric microscopes, scanning electron microscopes (SEM), X-ray, and atomic force microscopes (AFM) are used in X-ray mirror manufacturing. The performance of any tool directly depends on the ability to characterize and tune it. Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) is the most comprehensive characteristic of any tool; however, it is rarely used because of the complexity of its implementation. There are no suitable test samples with the required spatial frequencies or software. The objective of this proposal is to develop and commercialize an automatic, turn-key solution to enable the calibration of top level metrological instrumentation used in the manufacturing of X-ray optical elements as well as in many other areas of metrology and nanosciences. The heart of this project lies in the design and fabrication of ideal test samples based on pseudo- random line widths. The power spectra of such samples are inherently flat. Any deviation of the measured data from the flat spectra characterizes the signature of the instrument over its entire dynamic range. We have successfully used nanofabrication technology to fabricate a variety of test samples; the worlds best resolution of 1.5 nm lines was achieved. The developed technique was applied to optimally focus and verify the super-high resolution of soft x-ray microscopes, and to precisely calibrate the instruments. The best ever resolution of soft x-ray microscopes was achieved when using our test samples. A variety of test samples suitable for the calibration of TEMs, SEMs, AFMs, optical microscopes and interferometers were also developed and fabricated. The fabrication technology has progressed so immensely: test samples with a resolution down to 250 nm demonstrated in the past are now extended to a resolution of 30 nm. All the test samples were measured using metrology instruments. In Phase II, a turnkey solution will be developed: Fabrication technologies based on nanoimprint will be developed to enable inexpensive manufacturing of pseudo-random test samples for each type of instrumentation, fully automatic software will be developed to calibrate a variety of metrological instrumentation; the software will be adjusted and tuned for each kind of instrumentation. The worlds top companies highly valued our results, requesting the test samples and software immediately after they become commercially available. The solution will improve reliability, exclude the ""human factor,"" and simplify and expedite the calibration.

Preliminary results of coupling lasers with holograms demonstrated a suppression of lateral modes, which enhances brightness and, additionally, narrows and stabilizes the laser spectrum. The successful introduction of this technology in the laser marketplace depends on the ability to fabricate planar holograms at a low cost and a simplification of their integration with laser diodes. The objective of this project is to develop and launch the commercialization of holographic lasers with higher a brightness and power. Phase I will consist of exploring a novel nano-manufacturing technology for low-cost fabrication of planar holograms by imprinting planar holograms into sol-gel films. The research will explore the issue of correlating the imprint process parameters with the sol-gel material properties to replicate computer-generated holograms with high performance. Phase II will demonstrate the monolithic integration of imprinted planar holograms into commercial laser diodes. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the brightness and power density of current, high-power laser diodes can be increased, while retaining their compact size and low cost. Semiconductor diode lasers have achieved high output power, allowing them to transition from special scientific items into true industrial tools. There is a huge interest worldwide in major industrial applications of semiconductor lasers such as direct materials processing and pump sources for industrial solid-state lasers and optical fiber lasers. Development of laser diodes with higher performance is being pursued by all major laser manufacturers and will have direct applications in multi-billion dollar markets, such as material processing and the semiconductor industry. The proposed nanofabrication process will allow the low-cost fabrication of digital planar holograms and will simplify their future monolithic integration with commercial laser diodes.

Obese individuals are more likely to acquire a variety of secondary diseases including diabetes, heartproblems, immune deficiencies, some types of cancer, and osteoarthritis and they die younger than non-obese individuals. Obesity results from the development of too many fat cells (adipocytes) and the enlargement of existing fat cells throughout the body.Reducing caloric intake and increasing physical activity are often not sustainable and there are few safe alternative treatments. There are no treatments that take advantage of modern molecular medicine's advances in immunotherapy. Therapeutic applications of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) offer a way to target treatments to specific tissues. However, despite substantial work showing that mAbs to adipocyte plasma membrane antigens (PMAs) may be used to suppress fat development in animal models, there are currently no mAbs for either therapeutic or diagnostic applications in human obesity. Thus, the immediate goal for this Phase I project is to use Abeome's rapid and efficient DiSH (Direct Selection of Hybridomas) technology to isolate a battery of mAbs specific for PMAs on the surface of human visceral preadipocytes and adipocytes. Our long-term goal is to develop immuno-therapeutics that offer a variety of adipocyte- targeted outcomes, such as stimulating transdifferentiation of white adipocytes to brown adipocytes, inhibiting adipogenesis, or inducing apoptosis. Our Phase I Specific Aims are as follows. #1. Immunize 20 mice with human visceral preadipocytes and identify 10 mice with the best antibody titers to PMAs of human visceral preadipocytes and adipocytes. #2. Isolate at least one hundred hybridomas making antibodies to human visceral preadipocytes and adipocytes using Abeome's DiSH-PMA protocol. #3. Using whole cell ELISAs and immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM) identify 20 mAb reagents that react with surface PMAs on human visceral preadipocytes and adipocytes but not with human adipocyte derived stem cells (ADSC), human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC), human subcutaneous preadipocytes or adipocytes, or control cells from other human tissues. Abeome and its academic collaborators plan to submit a Phase II proposal to further develop adipocyte- specific mAbs as therapeutic, diagnostic and research agents. We will identify specific human mAbs that can be stably coupled to drug delivery agents and testedin vitro. The most appropriate drug delivery method will be tested in vivo to deliver a compound that stimulates transdifferentiation of white adipocytes to brown-like adipocytes or a compound that specifically inhibits adipogenesis or that induces apoptosis. Antibody targeted drug delivery will then be tested in appropriate animal models. The data generated in these studies will serve as the basis for clinical evaluation of this immuno-therapeutic approach to treating obesity.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Therapeutic and diagnostic applications of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) offer a way to target treatments to specific tissues and more critically assess disease status; however, despite substantial work showing that mAbs specific for adipocytes may be used to suppress fat development in animal models, there are currently no mAbs for either therapeutic or diagnostic applications in human obesity. Thus, the immediate goal for this Phase I project is to use Abeome's rapid and efficient DiSH (Direct Selection of Hybridomas) technology to isolate mAbs specific for human preadipocytes and adipocytes. Our long-term goal is to develop immuno-therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of obesity."

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are arguably the most important biological reagents used in biomedical research, diagnostics, and therapeutics, and the demand for them is increasing exponentially. MAbs are secreted from hybridoma cells that are fusions of antibody-producing lymphocytes (B cells) and immortal myeloma cells. Abeome's patented Direct Selection of Hybridoma (DiSHTM) technology represents a significant improvement to hybridoma technology. Through the use of a novel myeloma parent, genetically engineered for the constitutive expression of transgenic Ig-receptor proteins Ig-alpha and Ig-beta, all of the derived B cell hybridomas express a complete B cell receptor (BCR) complex on the cell surface. Specific hybridomas of interest are subsequently selected and cloned by Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) after labeling the BCR with fluorescent antigen. There remain, however, limitations within hybridoma technology that prevent efficient sampling of the full repertoire of plasmacytes, the lymphocytes producing the highest affinity antibodies. Herein, we are proposing an extension of DiSH technology that will allow the Targeted Selection of Plasmacytes (TSP). The TSP concept is founded on the transgenic expression of Ig-receptor proteins Ig-alpha and Ig-beta in engineered mice. TSP technology will result in surface expression of the BCR complex directly on antibody-secreting plasmacytes in mice, which can then be isolated using FACS based on expression of the BCR complex and its reaction with fluorescently labeled antigen. This Phase I project proposes to establish a colony of TSP transgenic mice, demonstrate expression of the transgene, and show that these mice are immunologically functional and thereby accomplish a major milestone towards a significant commercially feasible improvement in monoclonal antibody technology.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Monoclonal antibodies represent some of the most successful research and diagnostic tools available to scientists and clinicians. More importantly, their high specificity and sensitivity, coupled with favorable pharmacokinetics and safety, make them highly attractive therapeutic agents. The Applicant proposes the generation of transgenic mice that would greatly facilitate the isolation of antigen-specific plasma cells directly from immunized animals, thereby improving the speed and efficiency of obtaining monoclonal antibodies. The proposed project represents a major milestone towards the ultimate goal of generating transgenic mice that eliminate the requirement for the currently required myeloma-B cell fusion step."

The ability to detect airway obstruction early respiratory interoception helps individuals with asthma to manage their symptoms, to decide when to take inhaled medications. Impaired respiratory interoception, conversely, commonly delays treatment and impedes clinicians decisions regarding inhaled medicine. We developed breath-controlled video games as a means of pulmonary rehabilitation for individuals with chronic lung disease. Our experience with this approach in patients with cystic fibrosis shows that adolescents not only enjoy using a spirometer (a device traditionally used to measure inspiratory and expiratory flow rates) as a video game controller when playing an eye breath coordination task but they also learn to improve breath awareness. This finding has encouraged us to apply the breath-controlled video game approach to the problem of impaired respiratory interoception in asthma. Here we propose to further develop hardware and software for breath-controlled videogames that will function as an adjunct to respiratory therapy in asthma as well as for other chronic respiratory diseases. Programming of breath-controlled video games will incorporate a breath biofeedback educational process that promotes breath awareness by presenting the player with modulated representations of their own breathing patterns (Breath Biofeedback System and Method, US Patent pending). We will design and prototype a breath-game controller modeled after digital spirometers used for clinical diagnosis. Hardware and software assets created through this project will be used in a field trial of the effect of breath- controlled video games may also favorably impact asthma-related quality of life, as well as technique in, and adherence to, self-administration of inhaled medications. By embedding explicit educational messages within breath-controlled games, we expect this approach to promote self-management and effective use of health care resources on several levels. This project will also provide a foundation for studies of breath-controlled video games for adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mis-perception of asthma symptoms represents a common problem for millions of individuals who suffer this chronic respiratory condition. For unknown reasons, those with the most dangerous kind of asthma have the most difficulty with sensing the severity of their airway obstruction. In this project we develop technology for a novel, breath-controlled video game that will improve awareness of symptoms, and of respiratory wellness, in people with asthma."

Falling is common among individuals age 65 and over, one in three people fall at least once in a calendar year and Parkinson's patients are twice as likely to fall as their counterparts. It is expected that the proposed technology will provide a holistic view of a patient's health. The real-time data detected by the integrated sensors offers information that consumers and caretakers can use to plan health strategies at home and with their physicians. The proposed technology is expected to fit seamlessly into the lives of consumers so that they benefit from the power of technology without the difficulty utilizing it. Several fall detection systems are currently on the market; however, the two main issues with these systems are compliance and detection. No existing fall prevention devices determine when a patient's risk of falling is elevated. The proposed technology has the potential to enter the personal emergency response systems (PERS) market, which is estimated to grow to $1.86 billion by 2017. The proposed project addresses consumers' need to monitor and be proactive about their chronic health symptoms, particularly as they relate to falls. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and commercialize a device that predicts when a fall is likely to occur and to provide actionable feedback. We will use machine learning to achieve the proposed research objective by analyzing data collected from sensors embedded in a back brace to develop algorithms that will predict symptom onset and alert Parkinson's patients and caretakers to increased fall risk. The algorithms developed to analyze the data collected from the sensors on the proposed technology are the intellectual merit of this project. The machine learning algorithms will be used to find a correlation between sensor readings and symptoms the individual is experiencing. The anticipated results are that the correlations found in the data will lead to a better understanding of the individual's symptoms, disease progression, and which sensor readings indicate increased fall risk. Understanding the mechanisms that cause individuals with Parkinson's to fall will develop better alert systems and improve fall prevention. The results from data collection and analysis could also lead to better detection of early warning signs of Parkinson's progression."

Over 5 million Americans suffer from Alzheimerâs Disease (AD). The approved therapies available for AD only
treat symptoms and do not address the underlying neurodegeneration. Importantly, disease-modifying
therapeutics (DMT) to delay onset or progression of AD could reduce up to 50% of AD cases. However, the
major hurdle to developing DMTs for AD is the largely impermeable blood brain barrier (BBB). 98% of all
systemically administered therapeutics and virtually all antibodies fail to reach the brain, and thus are ineffective
at treating AD. Members of BBB transporters have been previously used to transport nanoparticle formulations,
but are associated with significant scientific complexity and toxicity risk. Abilita Bio will circumvent these risks by
using its proprietary and innovative platform, Enabled Membrane ProteinTM (EMP), to develop single domain
antibodies (sdAbs) that will latch onto transporters without altering their natural function, enter the BBB via
endocytosis, then into the brain via exocytosis. However, expression level of transporters and their efficiency
widely vary. Therefore, Abilita Bio will take a multi-target approach to identify a strong candidate. We have
identified transporters from 4 different functional subfamilies to test as novel antibody targets to deliver AD
therapeutics through the BBB.
The goal of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to develop sdAbs of our 4 identified targets and perform proof-of-
concept of BBB transport in vitro. This will be accomplished through the execution of 3 aims. In Aim 1, we will
use our EMP platform to evolve the 4 targets to generate variants with enhanced properties while maintaining
wildtype function. In Aim 2, we will immunize llamas with our EMP variants to develop sdAbs against each target.
We will test sdAb hits for specificity and affinity. With our two top hits, we will perform in vitro proof of concept
studies using a microfluidic-based BBB model. This model provides more complexity than simple transwell
systems and will provide more relevant data to support future in vivo studies. Successful completion of this Phase
I program will develop potentially two candidates with in vitro efficacy. This data will inform in vivo efficacy and
safety studies in a Phase II program where we will combine our novel BBB transporter sdAb with Abilita Bioâs
AD therapeutic that is currently under investigation. Ultimately, the development of this BBB transporter has the
potential to improve AD patient outcomes.NARRATIVE
Alzheimerâs Disease (AD) affects over 5 million people in the US and many therapeutics developed to treat the
underlying neurodegeneration of AD are unable to reach the brain because of the largely impermeable blood-
brain barrier (BBB). To address this unmet need, Abilita Bio is using its proprietary technology platform to develop
an antibody against BBB transporters that can serve as a delivery system for AD therapeutics. This antibody has
the potential to enable both previously unsuccessful and newly developed therapeutics to reach the brain and
improve AD patient outcomes."

Abilita Bio AB  an innovation driven biotechnology company requests SBIR Phase I funding for the
discovery of novel therapeutic antibodies targeting G protein coupled receptors GPCRs for the treatment
of metastatic breast cancer
In cancer therapy each treatment modality has its own limitations Clinical studies clearly indicate that
immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors PD  PD L  CTLA  etc  can achieve a persistent immune
response with improved clinical outcomes However this approach is especially effective when administered
in combination therapy with targeted therapy aiming at essential components of tumor spreading homing
and growth especially in metastatic cancer Metastasis is the major factor limiting survival in cancer patients
Therefore interfering with the molecular mechanisms controlling the metastatic behavior of tumor cells is
essential for successfully treating cancer
Experimental and clinical evidence supports the notion that one of the most important mechanisms
operating in metastasis involves homeostatic chemokines and their receptors Breast cancer is
characterized by a distinct metastatic pattern involving the regional lymph nodes bone marrow lung and
liver Tumor cell migration from the primary tumor site to the metastatic homing sites shares many similarities
with leukocyte trafficking which is critically regulated by chemokine binding GPCRs Interestingly several
studies have established that prostaglandin E  PGE  secretion by breast cancer cells can upregulate
CCR expression via activation of prostaglandin binding GPCRs EP and EP  This proposal focuses on
targeting key GPCRs critically involved in tumor cells metastatic migration and organ specific invasion using
therapeutic antibodies
The use of therapeutic antibodies to target GPCRs has a tremendous potential for the treatment of cancer
because of their high affinity exquisite specificity and low toxicity relative to small molecules However
GPCRs therapeutic antibody discovery is extremely challenging because of their inherent low stability low
expression and conformational heterogeneity outside their natural membrane environment In fact only
GPCR targeting antibody has been approved to date and only in Japan In order to overcome the afore
mentioned barriers Abilita Bio offers an innovative solution through the generation of Enabled Membrane
Proteins EMPsrepresenting structurally and functionally enhanced versions of natural receptors with
significant improved expression and thermostability The availability of highly expressing stable and
functionally folded EMPs will enable the isolation of novel therapeutic antibodies using in vitro antibody

variants using our directed evolution system  b characterize variants for expression function and
enhanced stability in mammalian cells  c develop biopanning assay tools using evolved EMPs as antigens

ABSTRACT
Significance Spinal cord injuries SCI cause costly and morbid chronic conditions such as
lack of voluntary movement increased chance of pressure sores problematic spasticity loss of
bowel bladder and sexual function and more physical impairments which result in a lower
quality of life and lack of independence Approximately people in the U S have SCI
with new patients added each year Current treatment options include an array of
electrical stimulation interventions or high intensity fitness regimens but all share one common
limitation of being episodic in their treatment delivery There is a compelling need for a
treatment option that can be used daily improves Activities of Daily Living ADL s  allows for in
home rehab and most importantly provides patient independence Enabling technology exists
often proven in other medical device applications that can facilitate the design of an upper limb
orthotic system to deliver the functional performance required by SCI patients The OlympEX
Medical Actively Powered Exoskeleton APEX device can meet the functional movement
requirements will be designed for in home use and be affordable to the user
Hypothesis We hypothesize that the APEX orthotic system will achieve clinically meaningful
improvement in a SCI patient s range of motion ROM capability to perform ADL s and to
perform upper limb rehab in an in home setting Preliminary Work The APEX orthotic system
will be the third generation of orthotic device system to be developed by OlympEX Medical
Generations  and  are passively powered device systems that have provided the OlympEX
design engineering team experience with mechanical apparatus requirements to elevate an
upper limb Likewise the team has developed capabilities in advanced materials for the body
chassis for these devices The APEX orthotic system evolves from these product platforms to
introduce system features in device guidance and user control only obtainable with an actively
powered system Specific Aims This project entails the APEX hardware electronic
architecture development and the acute pre clinical evaluation of the system on N  patients to
evaluate patient safety and device feasibility In Specific Aim  we will design fabricate and
evaluate the APEX mechanical design with electronic architecture A subset of the APEX
functional arm movements will be developed to demonstrate feasibility in performing a limited
number of high priority ADL s In Specific Aim  we will evaluate the performance of this subset
of ADL s on  SCI patients Success criteria will be Pass Fail as evaluated by clinicians In
addition an initial patient safety assessment will be completed Safety factors including
discomfort or pain before and after the fitting of the device and no uncontrolled arm movements
will be evaluated Together these studies will demonstrate the feasibility of APEX device to
guide arm movements required to complete ADL s and therapeutic arm movements in an
ambulatory setting
!Project Narrative
Those with cervical spinal cord injuries SCI have reduced ability to voluntarily move and use
their arms and hands which results in the inability to accomplish many activities of daily living
OlympEX Medical proposes to develop and test an active powered upper extremity exoskeleton
to help people with SCI and other neuromuscular conditions with their upper limb function and

and loss of independence, burden, and costs to affected individuals, family caregivers, and health care
systems. Despite the rapidly growing aging population and the high cost and consequences of AD and mild
cognitive impairment (MCI), AD and MCI clinical trials have been largely unsuccessful, costly, and have not
been able to demonstrate clinically meaningful effects such as delaying the onset or progression of clinical
symptoms. One significant barrier to successful dementia prevention is that currently available outcome
measures used in MCI clinical trials are unable to detect meaningful changes in cognition and function that
occur in MCI, resulting in small effect sizes that require large sample sizes for clinical trials. Development of
new assessment tools that are sensitive to the earliest changes in clinically meaningful cognition and function
are desperately needed to transform MCI clinical trials and lead to successful dementia prevention.To address the critical need for improved outcome measures for MCI clinical trials that incorporate
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations and National Institute on Aging (NIA) strategic
priorities, we will design, develop, and test a novel computerized assessment tool that combines clinically
meaningful cognition and function to improve outcome measures in MCI clinical trials. The âCognition and
Function in an IADL Taskâ (C-FIT) Assessment Tool will be easy to self-administer via speech or touchscreen
input; reliable and repeatable; and effective in detecting early and meaningful cognitive and functional changes
in older adults with MCI. The goal of the C-FIT assessment tool is to improve early detection of meaningful
change in cognition and function in MCI clinical trials. In this SBIR Phase I project we will execute three aims:
Aim 1: Design and develop the C-FIT assessment tool. Aim 2: Initial test of the C-FIT assessment tool. Aim 3:
Demonstrate initial reliability and validity of the C-FIT assessment tool.To achieve these aims, we will design a novel computerized assessment that evaluates key cognitive
and functional domains that are most sensitive to MCI. We will test the C-FIT assessment tool with 10 adults
ages 65 or older: 5 who are cognitively healthy and 5 who have a clinical diagnosis of MCI. We will utilize a
user-centered design process and iteratively improve the C-FIT assessment using participant feedback. We
will conduct psychometric testing with a new sample of 30 adults ages 65 or older: 15 who are cognitively
healthy and 15 who have a clinical diagnosis of MCI. To assess test-retest reliability, participants will complete
the C-FIT assessment twice, two weeks apart. Scores at each timepoint will be compared using intraclass
correlation coefficients. To assess concurrent validity, participants will complete validated cognitive and
functional tests used in MCI clinical trials. Scores will be compared using Pearson correlation coefficients.PROJECT NARRATIVEThe prevention of Alzheimerâs disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) is a top public health
priority due to the devastating socioeconomic consequences of AD/ADRD, and yet clinical trials for dementia
prevention have been costly and largely unsuccessful. New assessment tools that are sensitive to the earliest
changes in clinically meaningful cognition and function in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can address a critical
unmet need in clinical trials for dementia prevention. The proposed project will design, develop, and test the
âCognition and Function in an IADL Taskâ (C-FIT) Assessment Tool to improve early detection of meaningful
cognitive and functional changes in MCI Clinical Trials."

The device will be a less traumatic alternative to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the current standard of care for these patients. The target patient population is in the age and weight range of 3 mos - 3 yrs and 5-15 kg. The Pediatric Impellasystem will be designed to unload the left ventricle and promote cardiac recovery, providing blood flow in the range of 0.5-2 lpm for up to 2 wks of support. Reviewers pointed out in discussion that the device is not as minimally invasive as claimed and will require more anticoagulation than is suggested in the application. Since there are only a few devices in the field for this problem, this proposal addresses a great unmet clinical need and has high significance.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that approximately 9,000 infants born with congenital heart defects each year in the U.S. require some form of invasive intervention during the first years of life. Many of these children require mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to recovery or to transplant. Shorter duration of support (for days to at most a few weeks) for acute, generally recoverable heart failure is mostly provided by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). ECMO is highly invasive and is associated with a host of complications including blood clots, bleeding, ongoing heart failure, and strokes. Therefore, a strong unmet clinical need exists for a minimally invasive ventricular assist device (VAD) that can supplant ECMO for treatment of acute heart failure in pediatricpatients."

Chronic congestive heart failure is the largest unsolved problem in cardiac care today. There are over 5.5 million people in the United States with this diagnosis and the number of patients is expected to double over the course of this decade. ABIOMED's key innovation will be an apically placed implantable partial left ventricular assist device (LVAD) system designed for copulsation, called the Apical Copulsation Device (ACD). Synchronizing assist with the heart will reduce the work required by the heart during systole and unload the left ventricle during diastole. Phase I proved the feasibility of the ACD both in bench testing using a specially designed mock loop and in three in vivo animal studies. The system control is based on the left ventricular pressure and it successfully and consistently ejected 30 ml of blood during systole after the native ventricle opened the aortic valve and completed this ejection before the valve closed. No dilatation was observed and the ACD reduced the mechanical external work required by the ventricle up to 45% with no significant increase in end-systolic pressure compared to baseline. This device can be implanted through a thoracotomy and without cardiopulmonary support, reducing the risks associated with more invasive techniques. Phase II of the program will focus on developing a durable, integrated system for extended use and characterizing its effects on the heart. There is currently no published chronic in vivo data for copulsation therapy and studies will be conducted to assess the system's hemocompatibility and how the body reacts to this type of support over time.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic heart failure (CHF) affects over 5 million Americans, with 550,000 new cases diagnosed annually. The associated mortality rates are high with CHF patients under age 65, 80% of men and 70% of women die within 8 yrs. The 1-yr mortality rate is 20%, and that figure jumps to 60% for patients with end-stage (decompensated or New York Heart Association Class IV) heart failure. There are few treatment options for end-stage CHF and medical management is the first line of treatment with limited results. Heart transplantation can provide significant individual benefit, but its impact is limited by the number of donor organs available; worldwide, less than 2900 heart transplants occurred in 2005. Over the past 15 years, mechanical circulatory support has become an established means of treating end- stage CHF. A ventricular assist device (VAD) is a blood pump that is designed to assist or replace the function of either the left or right ventricle. The device is most commonly deployed on the left side (i.e. as an LVAD), where blood is withdrawn from either the left atrium or the apex of the left ventricle. The blood then passes through the pump and is returned to the ascending aorta. The Apical Copulsation Device (ACD) proposed here affords a very effective ventricular decompression and unloading without requiring cardiopulmonary bypass or a sternotomy. The role of VADs has evolved since their clinical introduction. For end-stage CHF patients, the Thoratec HeartMate LVAD that originally received approval for bridge-to-transplant (BTT) use is now approved for alternative-to-transplant (destination therapy or DT). The results from the REMATCH study showed that for patients who are not candidates for cardiac transplantation, mechanical support increased not only the survival rate, but also scores on physical and emotional tests at one year compared to patients treated with medication. While extending the life of these patients is important, the quality of this life is paramount. Earlier treatment of HF using the ACD approach provides the opportunity to treat many more patients and may also be more effective in preserving end organ function and restoring quality of life. With over 100,000 patients in the United States receiving biventricular pacemakers each year, it is anticipated that up to 50,000 patients may be candidates for chronic copulsation therapy. The market for copulsation technologies is a sizable portion of the moderate to severe HF patient population (represented by approximately 250,000 to 300,000 annual cases in the U.S. alone) and, hypothetically, may have a very significant total market potential (estimated at 0.8 to 1.0 billion)."

Key innovations include improved durability and hemodynamic properties, lower manufacturing costs, and simplified delivery over existing transcatheter bioprosthetic valves. The polymeric valve is less susceptible to damage upon crimping, while the polyurethane material does not require glutaraldehyde fixation, unlike biological tissue. Abiomed has developed a solvent-cast polyurethane valve platform technology that has performed well in ventricular assist devices (VADs) and a total artificial heart (TAH) and is currently being evaluated as valve prosthesis for conventional open-chest surgical implantation. A prototype low-profile percutaneous valve was developed using Abiomed's proprietary polyurethane (Angioflexj). The specific aims of Phase I include: 1. Further Development of a Polymeric Percutaneous Valve Prototype: o Optimize attachment to either a self-expanding or balloon-expandable stent o Determine anchoring mechanism for secure implantation o Optimize valve incorporation with existing 18 F or less delivery catheter 2. In Vitro Evaluation: o Simulated placement testing o Hydrodynamic characterization o Commence accelerated life testing Phase II will incorporate feedback from the in vitro evaluation of the prototype device and subsequent animal studies will evaluate device delivery, validate valve fixation within the aortic annulus, assess paravalvular leakage, and assess valve clearance of coronary ostia and hemodynamic performance. Further animal studies will evaluate transcatheter deliverability using either a retrograde femoral approach for aortic placement or antegrade transapical approach for placement in the aortic or mitral valve position. Thromboresistance of the valve and supporting stent structure, and assessment valve durability relative to calcification or other physical degradation will be performed in Phase II.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We anticipate that improved durability and hemodynamic properties, and simplified delivery of a polymeric percutaneous valve will have significant advantages over existing percutaneous valves. We further anticipate a significant cost reduction when compared to existing percutaneous valves, while manufacturability in a wider range of clinically relevant diameters will be possible. Development of polymeric percutaneous valve technology in Phase I will permit in vivo evaluation in Phase II before proceeding to initial clinical studies. In summary, the valve proposed in this research will lead to a new generation of percutaneous heart valves that improves upon the shortcomings of existing valves, reduces the cost burden on the health care system and improves the standard of care for patients with valvular heart disease."

The device will be a less traumatic alternative to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the current standard of care for these patients. The target patient population is in the age and weight range of 3 mos - 3 yrs and 5-15 kg. The Pediatric Impella system will be designed to unload the left ventricle and promote cardiac recovery, providing blood flow in the range of 0.5-2 lpm for up to 2 wks of support. Reviewers pointed out in discussion that the device is not as minimally invasive as claimed and will require more anticoagulation than is suggested in the application. Since there are only a few devices in the field for this problem, this proposal addresses a great unmet clinical need and has high significance.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that approximately 9,000 infants born with congenital heart defects each year in the U.S. require some form of invasive intervention during the first years of life. Many of these children require mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to recovery or to transplant. Shorter duration of support (for days to at most a few weeks) for acute, generally recoverable heart failure is mostly provided by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). ECMO is highly invasive and is associated with a host of complications including blood clots, bleeding, ongoing heart failure, and strokes. Therefore, a strong unmet clinical need exists for a minimally invasive ventricular assist device (VAD) that can supplant ECMO for treatment of acute heart failure in pediatric patients."

The use of the device can provide an alternative procedure to the current manual suturing methods, with the potential of yielding anastomoses having better and more reproducible performance, and with reduced cross-clamping or bypass time requirements. The immediate application of this device is in making an end-to-side anastomosis between a graft/cannula and the aorta, for example, as the outflow conduit for a VAD. Under Phase I of the program, a feasibility prototype will be designed, fabricated, and characterized via both ex vivo and acute in vivo studies. Based upon the success of our Phase I studies, Phase II of the program would focus on the development of a tool with integrated functions, chronic in vivo studies for biocompatibility, and design optimization for ease of use and manufacturing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The stapler will improve the quality of large vascular anastomoses and reduce the operating time requirements. There are numerous surgical applications that could benefit from a rapid and repeatable method of placing large (i.e. greater than 5 mm diameter) synthetic vascular grafts, especially a method that reduces the rate of bleeding complications. These include ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation, arteriovenous (AV) fistula placement for renal dialysis, aortic arch reconstruction, and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. This vascular stapler may be applicable to 100,000 procedures per year in the U.S. alone."

This type of ventricular assist device (VAD) will provide the optimal support for recovery for acute heart failure patients, and may be useful for a select group of chronic heart failure patients supported on VADs. Phase I of the program will demonstrate the feasibility of an innovative VAD system designed to permit rapid insertion and to provide hemodynamic tunability for optimizing ventricular recovery. Key design milestones will include prototype construction, in vitro characterization and in vivo feasibility testing. Following the successful completion of the Phase I studies, Phase 2 of the program will focus on further developing the system for extended use and characterizing its use for ventricular recovery. The Phase 2 results will permit a timely commercial introduction of this technology. This device&#039;s ability to tailor support from complete decompression, to gradual reloading, and finally to normalization of the myocyte stress environment will provide heart failure patients the best chance for cardiac recovery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A growing trend in mechanical circulatory support is the application of ventricular assist devices (VADs) to bridge-to-recovery (BTR), where the goal is to recover the native heart. LVADs provide profound LV volume and pressure unloading while simultaneously restoring both coronary and systemic blood flow. In cases of acute heart failure, it is frequently observed that the rested but well perfused myocardium experiences healing and ultimately a restoration of function. As a result, a strong clinical need exists for a VAD that is easy to implant and tunable to optimize the hemodynamic conditions for recovery. The innovative VAD system proposed here will permit a rapid insertion along with hemodynamic tunabilty to optimize the conditions for recovery. With the proposed device, patients will have mechanical support tailored to their evolving needs: complete decompression early on, then gradual reloading of the heart, and finally normalization of the myocyte stress environment after cardiac recovery. The proposed system would be directly applicable to acute heart failure patients (e.g. those suffering from cardiogenic shock subsequent to acute myocardial infarction, myocarditis, or open heart surgery), which includes approximately 100,000 patients per year in the U.S. It may also promote myocardial recovery in those chronic heart failure patients who require VAD support."

This integrated power system will be adapt
able to a host of next generation fully implantable mechanical circulatory support (MCS) systems. To date, fully implantable systems (i.e. the combination of an implantable electric MCS system and a TET system allowing electrical power transfer across the
intact skin) appear to be the most promising approach to eliminating the risk of exit site infection altogether. Most MCS systems in clinical use today require either cannulae (if the blood pump is extracorporeal) or drivelines (if the blood pump is intrac
orporeal) to cross the patient&#039;s skin. With such percutaneous designs, infection at the exit site is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality during long term management of patients. Under Phase I of the program, the feasibility of the digital, fault-tol
erant TET system was demonstrated. Abiomed&#039;s analog TET system for the FDA-approved AbioCor Implantable Replacement Heart was redesigned using digital circuits, enhanced for fault-tolerance, and reconfigured for improved spatial coupling. Digital versions
of both the implanted TET (iTET) and external TET (eTET) electronics were prototyped and tested. A preferred TET configuration was then selected as the basis for the Phase II program. Under the proposed Phase II program, Abiomed&#039;s key innovation will be a
universal TET system, integrated with an implantable battery pack having very high capacity (60 Wh) and cycle life (gt1,000 charge/discharge cycles). A digital, fault-tolerant TET architecture and novel solid state lithium battery chemistry will be employe
d. Sold as an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) product, this flexible power system will bring the survival and quality of life benefits of fully implantable technology to an increased number of patients through a host of MCS systems. Under the continu
ed program, the design and feasibility testing of the universal TET system will be completed. Based on the success of our Phase II program, private funding would enable further development and design qualification activities in anticipation of commercial l
aunch of the universal TET product. Abiomed would partner with at least one other company to integrate the universal TET system into the partner&#039;s MCS system; transfer the universal TET system to manufacturing and produce clinical units for the partner; an
d provide technical support while the partner completes system-level safety and compliance testing, conducts clinical trials, and seeks regulatory approval for its MCS system. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE: Existing schemes for powering implantable mechanical ci
rculatory support (MCS) systems pose the risk of infection at cable exit sites, particularly during long term use. Transcutaneous energy transmission (TET) systems reduce this risk by delivering electrical power across the intact skin, but this technology
has not yet come into widespread use. The universal TET system and high performance implantable battery proposed in this research would offer a general purpose, highly reliable means of powering a host of next generation MCSSs. This original equipment manu
facturer (OEM) product would therefore both improve patient quality-of-life and enhance commercialization of MCS technology for long term applications."

Existing replacement valves suffer from several shortcomings. Specifically, biological tissue fixation and methods used to mount the tissue to the supporting stent of bioprostheses cause time dependent structural changes such as calcification and leaflet wear, which lead to valve failure. The flow disturbances created by mechanical valves include high velocity jets, turbulence and areas of stagnation, which cause blood cell damage, lead to thrombus formation and necessitate the use of anticoagulation for the rest of the patient&#039;s life. The trileaflet polyurethane valve, originally developed in the design of the AbioCor replacement heart has demonstrated excellent durability and hemocompatibility in clinical evaluation. This type of valve has the potential to address both the blood compatibility problem of mechanical valves and the durability problem of bioprostheses. The changes necessary for adapting the AbioCor trileaflet valve design to the requirements of a prosthetic replacement valve was the focus of the Phase I project. The novel methods for reducing the forward flow pressure loss ensure superior hemodynamic performance without compromising valve efficiency, durability and fluid flow patterns through the valve. Phase II studies will be primarily concerned with optimizing the design of the polyurethane replacement valve, and completing the necessary requirements to support a submission for clinical trials. We will be also be evaluating valves made from bisphosphonate-modified polyurethanes, which have displayed substantial resistance to calcification. The valve design will be optimized to address potential issues with calcification and blood compatibility. A novel dynamic in vitro calcification model and an in vitro blood compatibility model will also be used to compare polyurethane valves with tissue valves. In depth fluid dynamic studies on critical areas are planned to quantify any potential for thrombus formation (stagnation) and red blood cell damage (high shear regions). Finally, in vivo animal experiments are planned to verify both hemocompatibility and calcification resistance provided by the polyurethane valve design. Existing replacement valves suffer from several shortcomings. We anticipate that the anticoagulation therapy requirements of mechanical valves can be substantially reduced by using a polyurethane trileaflet valve. We further anticipate that a polyurethane valve design can potentially mitigate the calcification and durability problems of bioprostheses associated with tissue fixation and leaflet mounting. Finally, a polyurethane valve can be manufactured at a substantially reduced cost compared to existing valves. In summary, the valve proposed in this research will lead to a new generation of replacement heart valves that improves upon the shortcomings of existing replacement valves, reduces the cost burden on the health care system and improves the survival rate of patients with heart valve prostheses"

Although VADs, both implantable and paracorporeal, have become an important surgical option for adult patients with myocardial failure unresponsive to less aggressive therapy, no VADs are commercially available for short-term use in small infants who are critically ill with heart failure. This is in spite of the fact that most cases for cardiac support via extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are for infants following complex surgical reconstructions for congenital defects. An aggressive development schedule for a pediatric VAD is proposed. The necessary characterization of the VAD will be completed for a submission to the FDA for approval as a humanitarian use device (HUD). The clinical indication sought for the device will be for short-term use to bridge to recovery following complex surgical reconstruction for congenital defects. Specifically, the target population is neonates with a single functional ventricle anatomy undergoing life saving surgery. A significant fraction of these patients either have difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, or have cardiac failure after coming off bypass requiring the use of high levels of inotropes. The VAD is a pericardial wrap that contracts around the ventricle to provide cardiac support. The use of a short term, minimally invasive VAD should have a major benefit for these weakened patients. The device developed here will be implanted either at the time of surgery, or on an emergent basis for cardiac rescue and assist. The device developed will fill a large hole in the current public health care system. Pediatric VADs for the neonate population are neither currently available nor being developed for clinical use, despite this patient population having the highest need. The current technology used for this patient population, ECMO has an associated high morbidity. Funding the development of the neonate VAD will follow recent federal guidelines related to orphan product development of necessary medical devices with relatively small market potential. ABIOMED, as a leader in cardiac assist, will provide the technical expertise to develop the needed device."

With an increase in the use of long-term cardiac assist devices, there is also a need for the short-term ""bridge to recovery"" application. This application is intended to provide a low-cost temporary support for patients whose heart is capable of recovering. This ""patient screen"" can provide a group of patients the possibility of retaining their natural hearts, as well as lower the overall financial burden on the health care system by reducing the initial use of the more expensive long-term support. The ultimate objective of this proposed research is to develop a novel cannula system for ""bridge to recovery"" application. Abiomed is currently using a conventional cannulation system for this application, with both AB5000 and BVS 5000 ventricular assist systems. Although robust and effective, this cannula system is prone to occasional bleeding and can not be removed by a minimally invasive procedure. Both the elimination of bleeding and introduction of minimal invasive removal are expected to significantly improve the patient outcome and are critical quality of life issues for patients. Starting with the current Abiomed cannulae as a base, detailed studies in phase I will develop and test (in vivo) our novel cannulation system that will eliminate bleeding and allow for a minimally invasive removal. Phase II studies comprise a development program to commercialize the system and will include more detailed animal studies to examine the long-term characteristics of the cannula in situ. The need for a less invasive cannula system is very visible in our sector, and will become increasingly important as the sector poises to address larger populations. For these patients a robust, complication-free cannulation system will play a critical role in saving their lives."

Although VADs are becoming an important therapeutic option for patients in heart failure, serious problems persist secondary to thromboembolic complications and continue to be a challenge at times to clinicians, despite aggressive anti-coagulation regimens. Anti-coagulant (i.e., heparin) coatings are currently being used for short-term use. These coatings either dissolve rapidly, or are eventually covered by proteins resulting in reduced bioactivity. The polymer developed here will provide a slow, in situ release or anti-coagulants at the blood: surface interface, thereby changing the local coagulation properties.
The bioactive polymer will be optimized, and characterized in Phase I. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that anti-coagulants can be incorporated in to a biomedical polyurethane currently used in several different cardiac assist devices. An optimal polymer formulation, based on key properties for use in a VAD design will be developed. The release rates of the anti-coagulant from the polymer will also be measured. Key components manufactured from the bioactive polymer will be tested for long-term use to determine any impact on the overall device reliability. Finally, several prototype VADs will be built to demonstrate that current manufacturing procedures are transferable to the bioactive polymer.
The Phase I study will demonstrate the compatibility of the bioactive polymer with a VAD design. Phase II will primarily involve testing of a VAD constructed with the polymer. Readiness testing will be completed to verify the long-term device reliability. This will include detailed pre-clinical animal studies to determine the benefits of the use of a bioactive polymer for long-term VAD implantation."

Although, VADs, both implantable and paracorporeal, have become an important surgical option for adult patients with myocardial failure unresponsive to less aggressive therapy, no VADs are commercially available for short-term use in children or small infants who are critically ill with heart failure. This may be primarily due to the fact that the potential number of total cases remains small, especially in regard to the high costs necessary for the development of a viable commercially available product. An aggressive product development program for a pediatric VAD is proposed here. The end-point of the program will be an FDA submission for the first ever U.S. clinical trial for a pediatric VAD to be tested at a leading pediatric cardiac surgical center. The clinical indication for the device will be for temporary use either to allow myocardial healing and/or recovery (so-called bridge-to-recovery (B2R)), or to provide adequate blood flow in patients suffering from irreversible heart failure while awaiting heart transplantation (so-called bridge-to-transplantation (B2T)). The VAD being developed here will have several advantages over the current method used for short-term pediatric cardiac support (i.e., centrifugal pumps, usually with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)). The design chosen will provide pulsatile flow without issues related to either blood volume or thrombus formation. The Phase I study will demonstrate feasibility of the VAD design.

AF is the most common heart rhythm disorder, afflicting 5 million Americans, in whom it may cause symptoms from irregular heartbeats, stroke, heart failure, and even death. Unfortunately, AF therapy remains limited. Therapy with anti- arrhythmic drugs is poorly tolerated, has frequent side effects and does not reduce complications since AF is not cured. Ablation is a minimally invasive therapy that has attracted considerable recent attention, because it may potentially eliminate AF. Unfortunately, ablation is not widely adopted because it is technically difficult, lengthy (4+ hours), has only lt 60 % success (compared to gt90% for mostother arrhythmias), and a 5-10% risk of serious complications. A major cause of these limitations is that AF on the ECG represents many different rhythm disorders (arrhythmia mechanisms), that currently cannot be diagnosed in each patient. As a result, AFablation cannot be directed to them, and is empiric with extensive destruction of the atrium. Our products represent a disruptive technology that will dramatically improve and simplify AF ablation, rapidly widening its adoption. Our products quickly andaccurately diagnose the causal arrhythmias for AF in each individual. Once identified, ablation can be targeted directly at these AF sources for cure. We have substantial preliminary data to support this paradigm. Our AFSourceTM product has for the first time diagnosed localized electrical rotors or repetitive focal beats as the AF mechanism in 42/53 AF patients. Patients in whom these mechanisms were ablated had significantly higher freedom from AF than those in whom ablation did not bisect these sites (92% vs 62% at 2 years, plt 0.001). Prospectively, ablation at these sites (known as Focal Impulse and Rotor Modulation therapy, or FIRM) was able to terminate AF in as little as 5.5 minutes (vs. hours for conventional ablation). This project will finalize our technology for commercialization. Proposed studies address 3 Aims: 1) To perform mechanistic studies to diagnose rotors/focal beats and identify those that are primary sources for AF; 2) To perform a pilot clinical study comparing direct ablation at AFarrhythmia mechanisms diagnosed by AFSourceTM (FIRM therapy) to conventional ablation; and 3) To prepare a formal report for Phase II SBIR and FDA applications. Successful completion of our Aims will, scientifically, demonstrate for the first time that rotors and focal beats sustain human AF and, clinically, define a treatment paradigm for rapid simple AF cure. Our product and FIRM treatment may cause a paradigm-shift in the standard of care for AF. By improving and simplifying AF ablation, procedures willbe shortened and better tolerated, with potentially fewer complications, better facility and personnel utilization, and lower overall costs. These factors are likely to widen adoption, enabling more patients to access curative therapy for AF.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem that affects 5 million Americans, causing morbidity or death from stroke, rapid heartbeats and heart failure. This phase I SBIR sets out to prove that small regions of the heart detected by inventions directly cause AF, and that physicians can modify these regions for a rapid and simple cure. This high impact project will result in a paradigm-shift in AF therapy."

Based on Harley Boat Corporations patented technology; improvements to the existing patent; and information gathered from previously tested designs, the innovative craft is expected to achieve up to 4 to 5 times the efficiency of conventional catamaran hull vessels. Under Phase 1, a goal will be to show that the design will be superior to conventional skirted hovercraft. The proposed connector craft will have far better seals and will more efficiently create the needed lift. In addition to the rear air cushions, the SES also generates lift from the dynamic the V-Hull forward. The low loss aft air cushions and the forward V-Hull work together to create a far higher lift than previous vessels. Under the Phase 1 Option, the team will study the augmentation of the SES design through the use of power ram augmented technology, such as the Power Augmented Ram Landing Craft (PARLC)."

From this perspective, the challenge of the proposed work is to identify a set of haptic patterns that are of the greatest value to the soldier, and which can be readily perceived without time-consuming training and without cognitive loading. Certainly the soldier must not perceive the haptic information to interfere with concentration on critical tasks: Rather, it should assist in the effective performance of tasks."

Parents and other professionals do not identify the same needs as youth, and failure to engage youth with DD in healthcare evaluation compromises healthcare quality and outcomes. The market demand for a PROM for this population is high given the prevalence of DD and the significant healthcare costs for this population, of which the largest proportion with a genetic etiology is DS. In Phase I, we demonstrated that our technology can help youth with DD and related cognitive impairments complete PROMs. The PEDI-PRO prototype demonstrated strong internal reliability and elicited consistent scores from 56 youth ages 14-22 with DD and cognitive impairments. In fact, the Phase I award demonstrated ease-of-use of the survey in youth with an IQ range of 47-75 (of which 14% of the sample had DS), and the test-retest reliability and internal validity in those with an IQ range of 30-110 (of which 12.7% had DS). Clinicians across the country (n =14) established the usability of the PEDI-PRO prototype. This Phase II STTR will build a clinically robust PEDI-PRO Assessment Software to address the market gap in PROMs for youth with DD including DS. Specific aims: 1) Transform the Phase I PEDI-PRO concept prototype into a robust, fully functioning assessment software system for use in rehabilitation. 2) Test and optimize the psychometric properties of the PEDI-PRO item bank to ensure valid and reliable measurement. 3) Design a clinically interpretable score report that accurately characterizes youthâs functional performance.The Phase II study design adheres to the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) framework to establish the validity and reliability of the PEDI-PRO. We will continue our partnership with a Youth Panel (n = 5) and Advisory Board (n = 8). We will design the PEDI-PRO Clinical Management System (PCMS: a HIPPA compliant clinician administrative dashboard) and incorporate 45 additional items (15 per domain, selected by the Youth Panel and Advisory Board) into the PEDI-PRO. Second, 300 youth with DD will complete the PEDI-PRO, including 50 individuals with DS, thus exceeding the prevalence estimates that individuals with DS make up 15-20% of those with an intellectual disability. We will adhere to COSMIN standards and examine the structural validity and internal reliability using both classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). We will also use hypothesis testing to establish known groups and convergent validity. Third, we will incorporate automatic scoring into the PEDI-PRO Assessment Software; we will use a mixed methods to design and evaluate two score report prototypes. This Phase II will enable AbleLink Technologies to aggressively pursue commercialization through a 9 month to market timeline and distribute the PEDI-PRO Assessment Software for a variety of platforms.The lack of patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) appropriate for youth with DD poses a significant problem; research indicates proxy respondents do not identify the same needs as youth, and patient advocates and funders are increasingly calling for services considerate of patient-reported outcomes. Technology is now available that can scaffold the cognitive processes needed to self-report, yet many currently available PROMs use outdated paper and pencil forms that are not designed to meet the unique needs of youth with DD. This Phase II STTR will leverage our teamâs Phase I research and build a clinically robust PEDI-PRO Assessment Software to address the market gap in PROMs for youth with DD."

provide a multimedia (e.g., voice recording, icons, text to speech) interface, a customizable filtering tool to limit screen features, and computer-generated prompts to guide the user using Facebookâs Software Development Kit (SDK) and open development opportunities. It will culminate in a feasibility study to determine if the simplified multimedia interface approach can significantly increase independent access to the most commonly used Facebook features for
students and adults with intellectual disabilities."

The World Health Organization reports that 50% of
people with diabetes die of cardiovascular disease, and the overall risk of dying among people with diabetes is at least double the risk of their peers without diabetes. The literature further emphasizes the roles of education and self-management as key interventions in managing the disease. However, due to literacy deficits and a lifelong lack of opportunities to practice self direction, individuals with ID have not had the opportunity to utilize these key interventions. Therefore, this project proposes research, development and evaluation of a universally designed educational and prompting software application that integrates extensive multimedia and proven interface design techniques for independent usability by people with ID. Phase I will develop

While this population can offer revealing insights given their unique perspectives, self-expression often occurs in the dependent context of transcription by another person, or, perhaps too often, not at all. To address this issue, this project proposes to design, develop and test a universally designed digital story telling (DST) application designed to provide a format for independent self-expression and documentation. The system will provide system generated prompts to guide the user through a simplified process for recording, saving, organizing, retrieving, and distributing user-authored multimedia documents. Unlike the limited existing systems that provide proprietary outputs, the DST system output will be in the form of universally sharable video formats such as MPEG-4 (e.g., mp4) which is supported in iPad, Android and Windows environments. In Phase I we will determine the feasibility of the approach for providing a format to allow students with intellectual disabilities to independently create, save, and share a series of personal digital stories in comparison to one or more
mainstream multimedia documentation systems."

The cognitive challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities (ID) create even greater barriers in understanding the complexity of nutritional concepts such as the food groups, caloric values, saturated fats, cholesterol, daily recommended allowances, special diets, etc. Despite these barriers, various state and federal regulations require agenciesto provide evidence of client participation in menu planning and other nutritional processes. This has resulted in a high level of dependency on staff for nutrition planning, and ultimately results in significant health disparities related to excess weight issues in students and adults with ID-and particularly those with Down syndrome. The proposed research will evaluate the utility of an intelligent system multimedia software approach for supporting self-directed menu planning, grocery list development, nutritional education, and meal preparation. The long term goals of the project are to use live audio, video, digital images, animated graphics, and nutrition-based algorithms to: 1) guide users with ID through the process of independently planning and preparing nutritionally healthy menus; 2) generate a more independently usable multimedia shopping list based upon those menus, and; 3) provide an interactive, game-like format for engaging in nutritional education. Specific objectives for Phase I include development and evaluation of a prototype Menu Planning Module. The prototype system will be tested for usability and efficacy in comparison to a highly rated mainstream menu planning software system that is noted for its ease of use. The Phase I hypothesis is that the prototype system will allow individuals with Down syndrome to complete menu planning tasks with significantly less assistance than when using the mainstream system, and will result in menus that are at least as nutritious as those generated whenusing the mainstream system. AbleLink Technologies will build upon several previously conducted research projects to guide prototype development. There are three primary project tasks: 1) development and documentation of system requirements; 2) to conductsoftware development of the Phase I system prototype, and; 3) to use that prototype in a usability study to determine the efficacy of the approach to improve independence and engagement in the menu planning process. Phase II plans include finalizing and implementing a comprehensive set of menu planning options and features to support different dietary needs; development of the system's nutritional algorithms that will track and compare nutritional values during menu planning to individual nutritional goalsto provide an intelligent system approach toward promoting healthier menus; to design and develop the nutrition education module; to complete user login and data tracking/reporting/customization features; and to conduct a real-world field evaluation to determine the efficacy of the system over time in terms of weight loss/gain and other health related outcome measures.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will result in MyNutritionPlanner, a cognitively accessible software application that will operate on a wide variety of existing Android and iOS (e.g., iPad, iPhone) devices to enable greater independence, self-direction, and knowledge in nutritional planning and execution.

Concurrent with the dramatic increase in the numbers of seniors with disabling conditions, the Medicare system is expected continue to reduce services due to economic conditions and budgetary constraints. Additionally, the rate of demand for professional health care and direct-care workers is expected to dramatically outpace supply over the next decade. Consequently, community-based care of seniorswith disabilities will be more and more in the hands of the individuals themselves and their family caregivers receiving limited guidance from professional care organizations. One of the biggest issues that face home care agencies is the lack of consistency in care giving caused by inexperienced or changing caregivers and the high cost of home visits to monitor health plan compliance. The result of these inadequacies is that all too often many seniors with disabilities are prematurely moved to more restrictive, expensive and institutional living environments that would not be necessary if home health care was provided in a more consistent manner with predictable quality. One approach to help avoid premature removal from community living arrangements is to use new technologies to help improve self-directed personal health care compliance along with remote health monitoring tools for professional caregivers to enable seniors to age in place while maximizing quality of care for seniors with disabilities. Therefore, in this project we will build on the successful results of Phase I to develop HealthCare Manager, a personal healthcare support system using powerful mobile computer devices to make it easier for seniors to perform personal health care activities, such as knowing when and how to take medications or comply with therapy routines, and to track health care actions that have been completed. This innovative approach will help enable elderly individuals to age in place, maximize the consistency and quality of self-care, and avoid premature relocation to institutional settings. This approach uses new technologies to help seniors engage in self-directed personal health care while also employing remote health monitoring tools for caregivers and health professionals. A prototype system was developed in Phase I and tested for usability with 32 seniors by AbleLink's project partner, the University of Colorado's Gerontology Center. The results provided strong preliminary support demonstrating the utility and usability of the HCA system. For example, when using the HCA technology seniors performed a novel task at a 99.1 percent accuracy rate, with no prior knowledge of how to complete the specific health care task. Additionally, seniors using the HCA system were able to respond to the time-based reminders to perform a specific health care task 100 percent of the time, even with the mild distraction of watching a nature film during the testing period.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objectives of this project areto research, design and develop HealthCare Manager (HCM), a software system for improving consistency and quality of implementing home health care regimens for seniors living in their own homes. This relates to the mission of NIH by providing a support tool that will enable seniors to perform personal health care tasks more consistently and accurately, thus promoting individual health and quality of life."

However, opportunities for enhanced self-determination and independence as a result of computer use for individuals with intellectual disabilities are now being recognized and documented in the research literature. A new challenge that is emerging for special education and human services professionals is the need to assess the skills and abilities of individuals with intellectual disabilities with regard to technology use. Such assessments are considered an essential pre-requisite to equipping individuals with the right technology solutions given their needs and abilities. There are currently no assessment tools that address the unique computer use and interface needs of individuals with intellectual disabilities.



In response to a growing need, AbleLink Technologies proposes to develop and evaluate the Computer Technology Assessment System (CTAS), a self-directed assessment system for ongoing evaluation of computer skills and abilities of individuals with intellectual disabilities to foster successful technology use. This will be accomplished through field evaluation of a CTAS prototype that will be developed and tested in a pilot study. Forty students will be solicited for participation in the study comparing the results of CTAS assessment with traditional computer skills assessment results conducted previously by assessment professionals. Pearson correlation coefficients will be calculated using the assessment score from each of the assessment approaches. Correlations will be tested for significance at the .05 level. It is hypothesized that the CTAS administration time retirements will be significantly reduced due to the multimedia and universal design approaches that will be used in its development to promote independent usability.</p>"

Due to the fragmentation of the current health care system and lack of funding, no one single entity is responsible for providing or coordinating training and support for family caregivers. Family caregivers have difficulty getting to trainings and classes that would greatly benefit them and their ability to be a better caregiver because they have no one to relieve them from giving care while still maintaining other commitments. A portable health care support system that provides both recorded audio and picture-based instructions for each step in a home health care procedure could be a significant aid to alleviating this problem by providing a consistent, central source of information on the services provided to each individual. Very recently new computer devices, such as Tablet PCs, have been introduced that can provide powerful, portable computer systems for use in human service settings. Tablet PCs are fully functional PCs running a version of the Windows XP operating system, but with special features designed for portable use. The entire system is approximately the size of a notebook and users interact with the system through the touch screen display, rather than having to use a mouse or keyboard. These devices are lightweight, portable and can be used to present detailed instructions to family members on how to accomplish health care activities correctly while in the home. In Phase I of this project, we demonstrated the technical merit and feasibility of HomeCare Assistant for making it easier for family caregivers to perform health care services and keep track of the services that have been provided. The pilot study results showed significant reduction in caregiver stress for eight participating families as compared to eight control group subjects which received no experimental implementation (P<.05). In this Phase II project we will fully develop the HomeCare Assistant system and result in a system that is ready for commercialization in a Phase III project which will immediately follow Phase II. It is anticipated that this system will significantly increase the ability for family health care providers to confidently provide health care services to their family members, as well as experience sustained levels of reduced stress associated with the burden of family caregiving."

While there are approximately 8 million individuals with intellectual disabilities (e.g., mental retardation) in the US, there is no data specific to the subset of this population whose cognitive limitations prohibit the acquisition of functional reading skills. For these students and adults, absence of reading skills in our largely text-based society puts substantial emphasis on development of listening comprehension/auditory recall skills as primary for independent functioning in community environments (e.g., school, work, social activities). Current tools and methods for assessing and instructing listening skills involve a facilitated process with a high implementation cost associated with one-to-one facilitator/student ratios and therefore do not afford much opportunity for independent practice.

There is a great need for innovative solutions to rectify this disparity and make available the educational and recreational benefits offered by electronic books and materials to individuals with intellectual disabilities. Phase I provided substantive empirical support for the contention that the Rocket Reader system can be used by individuals with intellectual disabilities to access electronic books significantly more independently as compared to two leading electronic book programs. Phase II will build on these results to develop a palmtop computer based application that will enable individuals with intellectual disabilities to access electronic documents of their own choosing.

This, combined with the complex and text based interfaces of mainstream computer programs and operating systems, makes typical keyboard input largely inaccessible to this population. Voice recognition technology offers promise to overcoming this barrier, but currently provides the same barriers of excess complexity and text-based interfaces that prohibit access to those with limited conceptualization abilities and reading skills. For example, typical voice recognition software applications employ feature-rich text based dropdown menus and require users to read extensive on-screen text as a means of training the system to their unique voice qualities. This project is proposed to address these issues by employing proven multimedia, error minimization and other universal design software development techniques to create a simplified voice recognition application that is independently usable by individuals with a range of intellectual disabilities. Specifically, this project proposes research, development and feasibility evaluation of an Accessible Voice Recognition System (AVRS) that will enable students and adults with significant cognitive impairments to more independently control and navigate through computer operating systems and to create a variety of personal text documents."

indicates that 4-6% of adults in the United States have insufficient reading skills to even attempt
participation in the NAALâs literacy assessment in 1992 (Literacy in the Labor Force, p. 310-
320). While there are approximately 8 million individuals with intellectual disabilities (e.g.,
mental retardation) in the United States, there is no data specific to the subset of this population
whose cognitive limitations prohibit the acquisition of functional reading skills. For these
students and adults, the lack of reading skills in our largely text-based society puts substantial
emphasis on development of listening comprehension skills as primary to independent
functioning in community environments such as schools and work settings. Research and
development of assessment and instructional tools in this area have been targeted at populations
such as English as a second language (ESL) learners or individuals with learning disabilities, all
predicated on the assumption of the inherent ability to eventually acquire functional reading
skills. However, as school children with significant intellectual disabilities proceed through
elementary grades, it becomes increasingly apparent for many of these individuals that
functional literacy is not an attainable goal. This gap, combined with recent initiatives such as
the No Child Left Behind Act, demonstrates a significant need for research that focuses on
evaluating and improving listening comprehension skills within this underserved population.
Current tools and methods of assessing and instructing listening comprehension skills generally
involve a facilitated process such as requiring an evaluator to read passages, ask questions and
record responses. Predominant response methods may include multiple choice, auditory response, or gesturing (e.g., pointing at a designated picture), while response content can proceed from simple fact recall to the ability to make logical inferences from passages. However, this method involves the high cost associated with one-to-one facilitator/learner ratios, which may be in part attributable to the lack of attention toward this problem. To address these issues, this project proposes development and evaluation of an internet-based multimedia Listening Comprehension Assessment and Instruction (LCAI) system that is independently usable by individuals whose intellectual or other cognitive disabilities have prohibited the acquisition of functional reading skills. The project will build upon proven multimedia and error minimization
software development techniques and will involve three specific tasks, including 1) system
requirements development, 2) prototype design and software development, and 3) a pilot study to
assess the efficacy of the approach. The long term goal will be to develop and test a
comprehensive system that provides age-appropriate, independently usable multimedia software
modules that enable self-paced listening comprehension instruction and progress assessment for
students and adults whose cognitive limitations prohibit the acquisition of functional literacy
skills."

For further enhancements in power densities it is highly desirable to use High Temperature Superconductors with a greatly enhanced critical current densigy Jc at 3T at 77K, which would allow the use of liquid nitrogen as a coolant. Under these operating conditions the superconductor YBa2Cu30x (YBCO) can become the enabling material for these devices as it has excellent magnetic field retention of Jc at 77K. For high Jc-YBCO the superconductor needs to be bi-axially textured, achievable by epitaxial deposition of a buffer and YBCO layer on a bi-axially textured metal substrate. This substrate shoud be non-magnetic to reduce ac losses, and thin to obtain high engineering critical current densities Je and rduce conductor cost. This Project will produce long lengths of very thin, non-magnetic substrates with excellent control over substrate dimensions and texture quality. In the Phase I one meter lengths will be coated with an epitaxial buffer and MOD YBCO layer, aiming at a Je of 2500 A/cm2 at 77K, 3T.

To meet these requirements, CTI proposes a solid state Raman laser (SSRL) with an innovative architecture that produces 1.5 um output in short 1 ns length pulses. This architecture is calculated to compress the pump laser pulse by factors of five or greater thereby eliminating the need for short pulse pump lasers. Moreover, this Raman laser provides beam cleanup, efficiently converting and improving the spatial beam quality of the pump laser. The pump laser design is based on previous work at CTI and is a rugged, efficient design suited for pumping this SSRL. The architecture can also be modified to produce adaptive waveforms such as the pulse doublet, permitting microDoppler and wind measurement capability with the same transmitter and therefore multipurpose instrument capability. This program will tie together our experience in flightworthy lidar systems with recent advances in SSRLs. The proposed effort will model and design the 1ns transmitter, produce 1 ns long pulses by compression of the pump pulses in a lab demonstration, and perform a preliminary transceiver design."

The difficulty with current siRNA delivery is that the enzymes in the body degrade the siRNA before it can reach its target. Most current siRNA technologies on the market are based on permanent modifications to the RNA itself to enable delivery. These modifications typically involve changes to the internal linkages of the siRNA which often decreases the gene silencing ability. Ablitech&#039;s Poly-RNA system involves making reversible modifications to the siRNA solely for attachment to our polymer network; the backbone structure of the siRNA itself is left unchanged. This will allow for the delivery of the most effective siRNA units rather than sacrificing efficacy for enzymatic stability. We plan to specifically target pancreatic cancer as this form of cancer is one of the most aggressive, and it is estimated that over 37,000 people will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer this year. Pancreatic cancer has an extremely high mortality rate, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%. The average life expectancy after diagnosis with metastatic pancreatic cancer is only 3-6 months. Commercially, this research is anticipated to result in a marketable platform technology for gene therapy for the treatment of a variety of diseases such as cancer, HIV, and other diseases resulting from genetic abnormalities. The initial target market for Ablitech&#039;s Poly-RNA is the cancer therapy market, which is expected to
generate $55-$70 billion in sales by 2010. Currently, large pharmaceutical companies such as Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, and others that possess large marketing and distribution channels dominate this market and in recent years have commercialized technologies licensed from small, innovative companies. Ablitech seeks to follow this model for the commercialization of Poly-RNA."

The material is expected to provide higher drug loading with a controlled drug release profile, as well as tunable mechanical properties over the lifetime of the stent. This will be accomplished using block terpolymers of specific composition to which drug molecules will be covalently attached.  Recent advances in DES technology have increased the success rate of CHD treatment; however, restenosis (re-blockage of the artery through the stent) occurs in 10% of the implanted stents. Also currently available drug eluting coatings deliver the bulk of the loaded drug within the first 48 hours of stent placement, with little to no delivery after 30 days.

This technology would enable the integration of the metal /semiconductor junction into nanostructures that perform like singular solar cells. The advantage is that each nanostructure has its own collector. Assembling these nanostructures into a solar cell array will allow maximizing the surface for light adsorption. Additionally, this specific design accelerates the flow carrier by providing an ordered, nanoscale tailored, interface with direct channels to electrodes. Scattering at the internal interfaces of the proposed nanostructures will increase the optical path through the cell and thus enhance the optical absorbance, allowing for a further reduction of the absorber thickness. Besides, semiconductor structures at extreme nanoscale dimensions exhibit distinctly different physical properties than the bulk material, such as optical band offset and increase in band gap. This novel nanostructured solar cell will use a template synthesis that will be easy to incorporate into today&#039;s thin film technology. The proposed technology is versatile and the nanostructures can be made on virtually any substrate (conductive, nonconductive, rigid, flexible etc). Employing of CdTe/Au nanocables opens new avenue in fabrication of new nanocomposite materials exhibiting quite a number of unique physical properties. The proposed technology is applicable to fabrication of solar cells with improved efficiency. The simple and cost-effective process can be performed at room temperature. It does not require any expensive clean room facilities."

No device for non-destructively imaging the interiors of these specimens is generally available. The long-term goal at ABQMR, Inc. is to utilize unique capabilities in the field of miniaturized NMR and MRI instrumentation to develop new devices to overcome such problems in biomedical research and other fields. The objective for this application is a mature Ultra- Compact MRI (UC-MRI) prototype, ready for deployment in research labs, optimized in size, cost, and complexity to match the constraints of Xenopus embryology research. Preliminary experiments on phantoms, oocytes, and fixed embryos show that images at the necessary spatial and temporal resolutions are within reach of the current generation of miniaturized hardware. The central hypothesis driving this effort is that a fully miniaturized UC-MRI device can be constructed and operated in the biology research laboratory to produce images of live embryos of sufficient quality to answer important questions in Xenopus research. The rationale for this work is that the availability of a Xenopus-optimized UC-MRI device willdramatically increase the access to non-destructive MRI technology, improving data quality and enabling new types of research experiments utilizing Xenopus in a wide range of biomedical fields. The project has three staged specific aims. First, build a next generation UC-MRI prototype that meets the needs of Xenopus embryology research. Preliminary work indicates the required basic improvements: increased magnetic field gradient strength, lower temperature operation at 15: C and enhanced tissue contrast via selective fatty tissue excitation. Second, demonstrate that the UC-MRI can acquire research-quality Xenopus embryo images. Working in the RandD lab with slow growing late-stage embryos, the operating protocol of the Xenopus-optimized UC-MRI will be adjusted to provide images of sufficient quality to allow reproduction of published research analyses. Third, demonstrate the acquisition of research-quality images in a research setting. Images of fast growing early- stage embryos will be acquired by developmental biologists in their own lab. Given that existing prototypes are very small, rugged, and of modest cost, the accomplishment of these aims will show that this new, technically innovative miniaturization of MRI technology is fully capable of research-quality imaging in the hands of typical researchers. The ultimate product, a highly miniaturized UC-MRI device optimized in all respects for use in Developmental Biology, is significant because it establishes universal access to MRI instrumentation, instrumentation that overcomes the essential limitation imposed by opacity, yielding new and better data in Xenopus embryo research, and positively impacting many of the biomedical research areas funded by the NIH.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it develops an important, currently missing tool for Xenopus embryology research, non-destructive imaging, which will further enhance the utility of this organism for addressing the fundamental biology of human disease. The project is relevant to the mission of the NCRR because it will establish a new resource for research, the Ultra-Compact MRI, which will allow scientists to advance their understanding of a wide range of diseases."

More than 60,000 new cases of bladder cancer are diagnosed each year in the U.S. It is the fourth most common cancer among men and the 10th among women, with a prevalence of about 500,000 in the US. Our compact NMR device will provide a rapid, accurate differential diagnosis of bladder cancer by detecting the tumor cells in urine that have sloughed off the bladder wall. Our device will excel at finding very rare cancer cells, and the identification of cells in our device will be more sensitive than the morphological identification used in cytology. Our procedure will be quick (tens of minutes as against several hours for cytology) and may not require a pathologist, thus reducing the time and cost of the test. We will achieve this high performance in a compact, cost-effective, ease-to-use device, enabling point of care diagnostics and offering earlier bladder cancer detection in those who might be ill for the first time and, especially, to individuals susceptible to recurrence of the disease. The device proposed here represents possibly the world&#039;s smallest NMR. A prototype has been built wherein the magnet (with field strength of 1T) and the sample probe together weigh significantly less than 1 kg, as shown in Preliminary Results. Thus, provided it performs as intended to sensitively detect bladder cancer cells, this will be an attractive and affordable device to be used even at points of care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bladder cancer is a common and costly disease. We propose to build a compact and inexpensive NMR device which will provide a rapid, accurate diagnosis of bladder cancer in urine that have sloughed off the bladder wall. This development will enable point of care diagnostics and will offer earlier bladder cancer detection in those who might be ill for the first time and, especially, to individuals susceptible to recurrence of the disease."

They will enhance medical care and address the growing crisis of sepsis in hospitals. The devices are based on a combination of technologies - microcoil NMR and biochemical labeling by magnetic nanoparticles. The research will extend the performance boundaries of this technology, resulting in a detector for extremely dilute, immuno-magnetically labeled, pathogens. The broader impacts of this research are based on the importance of early detection of dilute concentration of pathogens and other cells that would permit more timely diagnosis of diseases, thereby enhancing healthcare outcomes. Early detection also reduces costs, as patients recover faster and require less intervention. Blood culture is a workhorse of the diagnostic lab, so there is a demand for a device that substantially improves its performance. Sepsis is a growing public health problem with significant consequences, so the motivation to adopt new tools for the detection and treatment of this condition is strong. The NMR device proposed here achieves enhanced performance in sensitivity, speed, size, and cost that will permit new uses in the future, including in the primary care setting and in the field."

Such imagers will benefit public health by improving laboratory animal research. Unlike other soft tissues, lungs are difficult to image with MRI because the signal decays rapidly. However, good MRI will allow serial progression studies of diseases and treatment of live animals, eliminating the need to use a large number of animals. Furthermore, the statistics of the results will be more reliable in serial over parallel studies. New Mexico Resonance, the research institution of this proposal, has perfected the technique to make high resolution images of in vivo lungs using a large 1.9T superconducting magnet based MRI system. There are many reasons for wishing to perform small animal lung imaging in animal facilities rather than in MRI facilities. There are quarantine issues associated with not wanting to take animals out and bring them back into the animal facility. Furthermore, the animal researchers can make measurements at will. ABQMR, the submitting company, together with New Mexico Resonance, has worked with MRTechnology, a Japanese company specializing in permanent magnet based MRI. These MRI systems perform standard imaging capably and are compact, low cost, and maintenance free. This proposal will combine the technical expertise of lung imaging by New Mexico Resonance with the permanent magnet technology being used by ABQMR. The Phase I goal is to obtain high resolution in vivo pulmonary MRI with a compact permanent magnet. In Phase II, we will integrate the permanent magnet with compact electronics to create a prototype small animal imaging system."

Beyond addressing the thromboelastography needs, the proposed broad-spectrum portable hemostasis platform can be extended to other coagulation tests based on fluid mechanical characterization of a blood sample, including prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and activated clotting time. This project will demonstrate the implementation of a blood coagulation test in a portable POC system.

The goal is to develop a brain-monitor to be used in the operating room to ascertain if a patient&#039;s level of anesthesia has become too light, such that the patient can experience pain, and understand what is occurring in the operating room, and remember the experience. Such an event is rare, but traumatic. No present brain-analysis system accurately distinguishes the boundary in light anesthesia, between that level in which there will be explicit-memory and that level in which explicit-memory is missing. The fundamental scientific goal is to provide a tool for further investigations of the mechanisms of explicit memory, in animals as well as humans. If the goal were achieved, it would offer the chance to develop a clinical tool for analysis, diagnosis, or prognosis of medical conditions involving changes in memory (for which present tools are often inadequate). The project is health-related in that it addresses a problem in clinical medicine, and will provide a solution to that problem, if successful.

If the ABR could be used to detect tumors, it would reduce overall medical costs and also provide a means to judge rate of tumor progression. This project proposes to improve the sensitivity of the ABR to nerve compression by acoustic neuromas by two means: 1) using a new chirp-stimulus recently published, which provides stimulation of all VIIIth nerve fibers, including those subserving low-frequencies. 2) stimulating at very high stimulus repetition-rates. A new method has been developed by Abratech Corporation which permits recording the ABR at the high stimulus repetition-rates likely to be needed for detection of small tumors. The research proposed will test the sensitivity of the new method combined with the new chirp-stimulus, in patients who have small acoustic neuromas. This proposal is health-related because it is directed towards a known health-problem: the diagnosis and monitoring of acoustic neuromas."

These errors are essentially due to incorrect weighing constantsin the computation of the relationship between source dipole parameters and the surface potential. Sucherrors occur when head model simplifications are used, such as a one-shell as contrasted to a morerealistic 3-shell model, and when a spherical model is employed instead of a more realistic head model.Errors in single dipole localization are magnified when multiple dipoles are required to model the sourcesof brain potentials. A relatively simple method for estimating misspecification errors has been devised(called the AB-plane technique) and examined using simulated data for models using one or two dipoles.The method permits the identification of models that are insufficiently accurate to produce valid DSL,and to compare models for their relative accuracy. In order to use the method on real (as contrasted tosimulated) data in which the contributions of each dipole is unknown an extension of the AB-planeestimation technique called the EF-plane method will be used. Although accurate definition of the EFplane is not possible, since the variables that define it are unknown, it is proposed that a close enoughestimate might be obtained using singular value decomposition. It is indicated that even if this approachis not entirely accurate, that it will nevertheless be sufficiently close to the AB-plane estimate to disclosemodel misspecification errors."

Some strains, including the Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) are able to produce a toxin (Shiga toxin), which can lead to serious human illnesses from mild diarrhea to life threatening conditions, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). A report from the CDC shows that non-O157 STEC infections are more common than illnesses caused by E. coli O157:H7. A review of records for non-O157 STEC isolates forwarded by state public health labs to the CDC between 1983-2002 showed that six serogroups: O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145, of the 61 serogroups identified accounted for 71% of the isolates recovered in the USA. In Europe a recent outbreak of STEC O104 infected approximately 4,000 people, led to over 800 cases of HUS, and caused the death of about 45 people. Other STEC serogroups, including STEC O104,O91, O113, O55, O118, O165, O128, and O8 also are an important cause of illness in the U.S. and in other countries, and public health authorities are monitoring for illness caused by these STEC serogroups. Transmission of STEC infection mainly occurs through contaminated food or water, and from contact with animals. Various types of animals, in particular cattle and other ruminants, can be healthy carriers of human-pathogenic STEC. During processing, fecal contamination of the carcass or transfer of bacteria found on the animal hide to the carcass can facilitate transmission of STEC into the food supply. Preventing the threats by all Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) will reduce the cost of illness and death. According to the USDA Economic Research Service, during 2009 there were 73,480 cases due to E. coli O157:H7 costing $478 million, the cost of acute and chronic illness due to the non-O157 has not been calculated. The USDA Economic Research Service has also estimated the cost due to E. coli O157:H7 to be $488 million during 2010, while the cost of acute and chronic illness due to the non-O157 has not yet been reported. However, based on CDCs estimated cases of 31,229 on the non-O157 STEC from all sources, each case costs $6652 and it totals to $208 million. There are additional costs such as long-term health effects; price paid by the food or foodservice industries to issue a recall, dispose of product, and by public health agencies that have to investigate the outbreaks; PR campaign to restore a company's reputation, and the after-effects that a major crisis can have on sales for the whole industry. In 1994, the USDA-FSIS declared E. coli O157:H7 an adulterant in beef products, and on September 2011 E. coli serogroups O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145 (top 6 non-O157 serogroups) were declared as adulterants on raw, non-intact beef products or components in the same manner as E. coli O157:H7. The USDA-FSIS performs a verification sampling program to test for these pathogens in samples collected from federally inspected establishments and retail stores. The testing protocol mandated by the USDA-FSIS is described in the USDA-FSIS, MLG Chapter 5B.03 ""Detection and Isolation of non-O157 Shiga-Toxin Producing Escherichia coli Strains (STEC) from Meat Products"""

The availability of a screening method to determine if compost is safe to be used in crops and ornamental flowers will greatly help protect the composting industry from law suits and growers from damaged crops. This project will also help reduce the adverse impact of animal manure on the environment, assure that crops labeled as organic are free of pyridine carboxylic acid herbicide chemical inputs, and to help optimize manure management. Current analytical methods for quantifying the concentration of pyrimidine carboxylic acid herbicides in compost and waste products, include solvent extraction, followed by instrumental analysis. These methods are time consuming, labor intensive, and require in some cases the use of flammable and/or toxic solvents. A faster, customer/environmentally friendly and less expensive method such as a lateral flow immunochromatographic device (dipsticks) for the detection of pyrimidine carboxylic acid herbicides could find a broad application in the composting, agricultural (crops) and environmental monitoring (water) markets. The proposed analytical test will allow establishment of efficient and cost-effective screening programs that could be used quickly on-site for the analysis of compost ad other environmental matrices, therefore protecting compost producers, users, and the environment. The strategy in this proposal will be performed in 2 phases. Phase I, focuses on creating polyclonal antibodies and several hybridoma cell lines that produce monoclonal antibodies, which react with the pyridine carboxylic acid herbicides of interest with sufficient selectivity, affinity and avidity to be utilized in a commercial dipstick type immunoassay system. Once these antibodies are developed, phase II will be started, this phase will involve the development and validation of a commercial dipstick immunoassay format for on-site testing, to detect the target herbicides in animal waste such as compost, solid manure, farmyard waste and manure slurry, as well the required extraction procedures to be able to quickly and easily analyze the extracts from those matrices. One of our approaches to obtain broad selectivity of the immunoreagents towards the 4 target analytes will be to prepare antibody cocktails. The proposed research is in line with several of USDA&#039;s strategic goals: 1) will expand domestic marketing opportunities for compost and manure byproducts and strengthen risk management by allowing to monitor those product for contamination with pyridine carboxylic acid herbicides that have potential to destroy crops, therefore, helping farmers, researchers and compost facilities in their decision-making process; 2) develop alternative markets for agricultural byproducts; 3) safeguard agriculture from herbicide threats i. e. if contaminated manure were to be used as fertilizer."

Anatoxin-a is also know as Â¿the very fast death factorÂ¿ (LD50 for mice is 200 ug/Kg with 4-7 minute survival), wild and domestic animals poisoned through ingestion have been observed in the field to be staggering, gasping and suffering convulsions, following by death within minutes to hours."

Effective environmental and health protection requires the sensitive and efficient detection of PFOA in various sample matrices such as foods, water, soil, sediment, blood, etc. Therefore, faster and less expensive analytical methods such as ELISA for the detection of PFOA are ideal for the establishment of efficient and cost-effective screening programs for these compounds.

Viruses have significant commercial application as vectors for gene and cell therapy as well as vaccines for
cancer treatment and infectious diseases The purification of commercial viruses is a major area of bioprocess
development Current methods are mostly based on filtration and chromatography both of which scale poorly
and require clean feed streams to perform well Viral particles are difficult to recover from culture supernatants
or cell lysates because they are similar in size to cell debris A large amount of expensive high quality
nuclease Benzonase is typically needed to reduce the viscosity of the lysate sufficiently for efficient
membrane and column operations Affinity based vector purification has been developed for only one type of
vector some strains of adeno associated virus  and is also very expensive In summary virus purification is
challenging and significant amounts of valuable product are lost in inefficient filters
We have developed a novel DNA based avidity reagent termed DeNAno that can provide a significant
advance in the development and manufacturing of commercial viruses with applicability to a variety of viral
vectors DeNAno uses massive avidity rather than affinity to capture biologic targets such as viruses DeNAno
particles are composed of a single stranded DNA concatemer which contains several hundred copies of a
template oligonucleotide The goal of this project is to develop DeNAno particles that bind to a target virus and
then use the DeNAno as a capture reagent for virus purification DeNAno libraries are produced by rolling
circle replication of a circular oligonucleotide template containing a random sequence and specific viral
binders are recovered by a biopanning process DeNAno particles can be released from their targets by
disrupting their secondary structure through divalent cation removal they can also be labeled with nano
particulate magnetite or coated onto micron sized magnetite to allow their use as magnetic capture reagents
We have already performed a selection on adenovirus coated beads and obtained a pool of DeNAno particles
that bind the target virus The specific aims of this project are to characterize DeNAno particles that bind to
the model virus adenovirus anddemonstrate their use as a purification tool by attaching them to magnetite
so that they can be used in magnetic capture The virus will be released following capture by divalent cation
removal and the magnetic DeNAno cleared from the viral preparation again by magnet We will assess the
capture efficiency virus yield and infectivity residual DeNAno contamination and the presence of host cell
proteins in the final preparation If successful this project will demonstrate the potential of the DeNAno
technology to streamline virus production and pave the way for additional DeNAno based applications
targeting other commercially important viruses One application of viruses is as a treatment for different diseases including cancer but these viruses are
difficult and expensive to manufacture at sufficient purity This project will develop a new technique that
replaces several cumbersome virus production steps with a simpler and cheaper method of purifying viruses
from their cellular source material"

At a high level many parts are created today customized to a specific users need and a small handful of humans have the knowhow and access to machines to create such customized parts on their own. The complexity of this can be mitigated by creating tools for translation of information from people?s ideas to machine output with much less error and cost. By creating a means to simplify the process of getting from idea to customized fabricated parts, the proposed tool can help achieve balance between creativity and production more easily for Maker Manufacturing. Upon successfully deploying a uniformed solution to the overly complex mesh of fabrication processes used today, hundreds of thousands of new machines can be employed at any end point by interchangeable people to bring to bear goods at any level of precision needed. The end goal is creation of a portal and toolset for fabricators to take and fulfill small batch manufacturing of parts. Success will mean that hundreds to thousands of times more people will be able to create tangible goods from ideas and concept combinations. This is a project to unify CAD/CAM (Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Machining) across all digital fabrication tools and reduce the complexity of machining designs. While 3D printing may bring an idea of simplicity and access to everyone, laser cutting, CNC (Computer Numeric Controlled or Robotic), injection molding, vacuum forming, and other tools of mass production can likewise also be made more accessible. The project is a software tool embodying a single process for which any design can start at one end and any machine be placed at the other end. At least in showing how much of the same end result, if any, each machine is capable of producing of the intended output. This project will produce a part plus material algorithm by which any part that can be fabricated can be proposed to the algorithm and all of the machines capable of producing them can be identified. From there the scale - both in size of part and number - of copies of the part can be added in and thus sort the machines by best part quality, price, and overall speed of production at any volume. The goal of the research is to capture all existing manufacturing practices in machine shops and Maker places, and assure that none of today?s capabilities are lost while creating a living algorithm that allows for future capabilities to be added to any fabrication process."

PI, Dr. Hanbae Yang, is using novel engineered glass-metal hybrid materials developed by ABSMaterials, Inc. of Wooster, Ohio to remediate environmental pollutants. Runoff control is an immediate and growing concern in the US. Stormwater often laden with nutrients, hydrocarbons, herbicides, and pharmaceuticals, damaging surface water and carrying persistent chemicals impacting humans and ecosystems. Dr. Yang's innovations for controlling runoff pollutants using engineered glass (Osorb)-metal composites mixed into bioretention systems have demonstrated effectiveness on atrazine, estradiol, endocrine disruptors, BTEX, and nutrients. The Osorb-metal composites combine two advanced remediation materials: (1) a high-capacity organosilica sorbent, Osorb, and (2) reactive embedded metals. The composite materials absorb pollutants by removing them from the water and degrade the pollutants within the glass. The key technology developments to be achieved in Phase II include (1) formula optimization field testing with clients, (2) formulation performance improvements, and (3) development of commercial and modular bioretention packages. Compared to older bioretention systems, it is expected some of these systems will see orders-of-magnitude improvement in effective stormwater pollutant remediation and set new standards for best management practice. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project conducted by Dr. Yang and ABSMaterials will include: (1) providing an entirely new tool for resolving combined sewer overflow challenges with green infrastructure for dozens of cities, (2) substantial reduction of environmental pollution with lower treatment cost for contaminated stormwater, (3) improvement of aquatic and human health, and (4) facilitation of green stormwater reuse. The EPA and state governments are mandating many stormwater programs control non-point-source/CSO pollution. The tools for runoff treatment are often lacking to meet stricter regulations. Developing economical and effective Osorb-based stormwater solutions will substantially reduce negative effects of runoff pollutants on human and aquatic health. Seattle estimates economic impact of uncontrolled stormwater runoff at $113M and plans to build 12,000 bioretention systems to reduce urban runoff by 16,000,000 gallons annually. Other cities, including Cleveland, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New York, are developing similar green infrastructure strategies. ABSMaterials is further developing an integrated curriculum for science courses at high schools and colleges and providing internships and training experiences involving advanced materials and water remediation. The company expects to create 6 new full-time positions working directly on the commercial activities during the period of this grant."

Storm water runoff is a major component of non-point source pollution. The presence of excessive nutrients, metals, hydrocarbons, herbicides, and pharmaceuticals in surface, ground and drinking water is of particular concern due to their persistence and toxicity. Controlling runoff pollutants will be accomplished using engineered glass (Osorb)-metal composites mixed into bio-retention systems. Osorb physically absorbs a wide variety of volatile organic pollutants from water. Osorb will chemically remediate pollutants with embedded particles of catalytic metals. Breakdown byproducts of pollutants can be biologically mineralized in bio-retention systems or consumed as foods by the biotic community. It is expected that Osorb-metal composites amended soils will have significantly improved removal efficiency of multiple runoff pollutants without compromising hydraulic performance of the systems. The broader/commercial impacts of this research include: Substantial reduction of local toxic runoffs, protection from flooding and property damage by improving plant health and water-retainment of soils, improvement of aquatic and human health, and facilitation of sustainable water reuse. It is estimated by US EPA, runoff pollutants result in a multitude of economic losses in the US annually including; $30 million + annual direct losses for fishing industries, $2 billion + annual losses for beach tourism due to toxic closures and $17 million+ extra treatment costs in drinking water treatment plants. The state and federal governments are mandating local storm water programs to control storm water pollution and the cost of storm water runoff treatment is expected to significantly increase with a stricter regulatory climate. Developing cost-effective and effective storm water best management practice (BMP) would substantially reduce negative effects of runoff pollutants on human and aquatic health. The City of Seattle recently released a 2010 study which estimated the economic impact of uncontrolled storm-water runoffs at $113M. These costs combined the demonstrated losses to wildlife, human access to water resources, added costs of water treatment and 3 documented additional costs in human health care. The City of Cleveland and the local area watersheds have released a preliminary report reaching similar per-capita costs of pollutants in runoff waters."

Produced water is the water that is co-extracted from oil and gas production and is often ten times as voluminous as the extracted hydrocarbon. Phase II efforts will be focused on scale-up to fabricate a 200 gallon-per-minute produced water treatment system to effectively mine hydrocarbons from the fluid. The process uses a newly developed nano-engineered organosilica that rapidly and reversibly swells when exposed to organics, yet is hydrophobic and does not absorb water. The organosilica material is unique that it acts as a nanomechanical sponge extracting dispersed and dissolved hydrocarbons. The captured hydrocarbons can be recovered from the silica and the sorbent material re-used. Successful development of these water purification systems will allow for an entire new mechanism for produced water management. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project development is tied to the ability to treat numerous produced water streams which are currently difficult or expensive to treat, and to obtain a higher yield in the recovery of valuable products. Approximately 800 billion gallons of produced water must be managed annually in petroleum operations around the world. This treatment process will allow existing oil and gas production fields to meet existing or higher environmental discharge standards at a lower overall cost. The system will also reduce the impact or potential impact of the discharge of produced water in emerging markets with sensitive environmental concerns. From an economic impact the system will result in a higher yield for many oil and gas fields, by capturing for refinement valuable hydrocarbons which would otherwise have been disposed of as waste. Phase I results showed that 0.4-3.5% of a typical ""waste"" stream is composed of potentially valuable hydrocarbons which are not recoverable with existing technology. The recovery of these hydrocarbons, which are often the lightest and most energy-valuable compounds, such as toluene and octane, will increase the value of every producing well using this system."

Each of these permits will result in fracture operations needing 150,000 -1 million barrels of water. Frost and Sullivan, the market analysis firm estimates approximately 120 million bbl of water will have to be used in fracturing operations annually through 2025 to fully exploit the available and desired natural gas. A reasonable estimate is that 30% of this water, 40 million bbl, will return to the surface as flow back water. Flow back water contains a significant amounts of dissolved solids, chemical additives, and in late stages, hydrocarbons from the formation. ABSMaterials is developing water treatment system that removes organic contaminants from flow back water for recycling or reuse. The system can be used alone or to create treated feed water for membrane systems that can remove dissolved solids. The technology is based on Osorb, a patented swellable nano-engineered material with the ability to capture up to 8 times its weight in organics via reversible swelling. In Phase I of the project, a skid-mounted 4 gpm and trailer-mounted 60 gpm fluidized bed system were fabricated and tested with major oil service companies on the ABSMaterials campus. Results showed that & gt;95% organics were removed including hydrocarbons and surfactants. In addition, we began work to expand the use of Osorb to capture of metal ions from flow back water. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will convert pilot scale systems to treat flow back water to commercial-scale manufactured units. In Phase II, the 60 gpm pilot scale system will be enhanced and tested at several sites in North America to refine our system. In addition, a second larger ~250 gpm pilot system will be built as part of this project as the first prototype of a manufactured commercial system for field operations. It is anticipated that a system that can continuously operate and treat flow back water for $6-7/bbl will be achieved in 24 months. Key focus areas will be engineering and Osorb regeneration methods."

Treatment of produced water will be accomplished using swellable organic modified silica (SOMS) which can rapidly expand to five times its dry weight with organics, but which does not absorb water. The swelling process is completely reversible, allowing SOMS to act as a nanomolecular sponge for absorption of water contaminants. Pilot phase testing of SOMS in conjunction with oil majors and oil field service companies is the focus of the research. In addition, new advanced versions of SOMS will be developed to target specific contaminants, including the capture of barium.

This proposal has two strategic objectives: (1) develop and improve identified technologies to remediate produced water; and (2) develop process of production to make these technologies commercially viable. Produced Water (PW) is a term given to aqueous waste streams and chemical waters which are a by-product of petroleum exploration and recovery. In 2007, the Produced Water Society estimated 800 billion gallons of produced water were created from petroleum extraction activities around the world. The large volumes of produced water often result form an average of 11-fold excess of water compared to the amount of hydrocarbon recovered. Near the end of life of some wells, Produced Water can be as high as 98% of the total volume of liquids extracted. Costs associated with produced water management are often a key component to wells being taken of-line. On-shore or land-based, produced water is handled in four basic ways: 1) Treated and re-used in Oil Services for fracking or other well production activity, 2) Sequestered by re-injection below the water-table in unused or dead wells. I, 3) Dumped into existing waste water treatment plants, and 4) Dumped in disused mines or other locations believed to pose minimum risk to surface waters. Off-shore produced water is handled in one of three ways: 1) Untreated or partly treated it is discharged into the ocean, 2) Near-shore platforms may pump PW to land for treatment as on-shore PW, and 3) In rare circumstances off-shore re-injection is conducted. There are a number of environmental concerns with all existing practices of discharge. One of the most pressing concerns in the management of near-shore treatment on late-cycle fields PW.  Near-shore platforms are those which are within site of shorelines or strongly impacting coastline marine systems and other human activity.  These fields are commonly older.  Commonly are producing 20 barrels of PW per 1 barrel of oil.  The PW is generally highly saturated in organic acids, dissolved organics and in many cases radioactive minerals such as barium.

The proposed project consists of a highly accurate method to generate valuable utility end-user behavior data in hot, humid environments. Public and private organizations can use the data to design better policies and best practices. Moreover, the occupancy detection technology can be used for other applications where difficult ambient conditions prevent the use of conventional sensors. In addition to the economic and environmental benefits to the user, the business will create engineering, sales, and customer support jobs. The proposed project will eliminate behavioral water waste occurring when a bather leaves a shower unoccupied even after water warm-up. Project objectives include development of: (1) a device that can accurately sense shower occupancy across multiple shower/bathtub layouts; (2) a low energy circuit and algorithm for long battery life; and (3) systems engineering of a designed enclosure resilient to a shower's hot and humid environment. Project tasks include signal analysis for sensor accuracy, in-situ pilot testing across all rooms of multiple buildings, industrial design and accelerated aging tests. Technical milestones include: (1) Design a sensor that detects human presence within a 1% error margin when tested across at least 25 different hotel bathtub/shower layouts, (2) Complete live user-sponsored pilot tests in the rooms of at least 3 hotels for at least 1 year, and (3) Demonstrate that the amount of shower water and energy saved is at least 20% when compared to the baseline.

Â Commercial adoption of this technology at scale will save 200 billion gallons of water and at least 1 trillion kWh of energy in the U.S. every year. Â Reducing waste water and energy use decreases the strain on municipal water and energy infrastructure. Â Lower energy use will also have a significant impact on carbon emissions associated with electric generation. The innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding by developing a highly-accurate novel sensing technology that works in hot and humid conditions. Moreover, the occupancy detection technology can be used for other applications where difficult ambient conditions prevent the use of conventional sensors. The IoT device will generate valuable end-user utility use behavior data which public institutions and private industry will use to design better policies and best practices. In addition to the economic, technological and environmental benefits, this research also promotes jobs by providing enough utility savings to commercial buildings for them to increase their staff. The proposed project will eliminate behavioral water waste which occurs when a bather leaves a shower unoccupied even after the water has warmed-up. Â Developing the technology requires: (1) a device that can accurately sense shower occupancy, (2) a compact enclosure resilient to a shower?s hot and humid environment and, (3) low energy circuitry and algorithms for long battery life. Â Methods to achieve the project objectives include acoustic signal analysis for sensor accuracy, in-situ pilot testing, CAD design and prototyping to achieve device size constraints, and accelerated aging tests to ensure reliability and durability. Â The overarching goal of this phase I feasibility effort is to validate the novel utility savings methodology, occupancy sensor accuracy and calibration over at least 5 years, and a device battery life of at least 2 years. Â This project will be deemed successful if the following key technical objectives are met: (1) The sensor performs within at least a 1% error margin after relevant nondestructive, accelerated aging tests, (2) The amount of water and energy saved is at least 20% when compared to baseline during live hotel pilot tests, and (3) The device?s battery life is at least 2 years."

The intelligent processing of diverse types of data provides a target assessment technology that can more robustly deal with a greater number battlefield scenarios and provide a real-time capability. This proposal presents an innovative approach to automatically developing target assessment models. A development tool is proposed, the Automated Target Assessment Development Environment (ATADE). The target assessment models produced by ATADE will intelligently combines multi-sensor data and non-sensor information using several advanced computing technologies [24-28]. ATADE itself will take advantage of a synergistic integration of expert systems and abductive polynomial network technologies. The result will be a well-defined methodology to extract high-level decision knowledge from low-level sensor imagery for complex battlefield decision-aiding tasks. The proposed effort uses a multi-technology approach to provided several levels of target assessment information, including position identification, capability, and significance determination. Initial feasibility of this synergistic methodology has been demonstrated under ongoing federal funding. Anticipated Benefits: ATADE will have direct applicability to other civilian and military all-source information fusion challenges, such as those for commercial and private fixed-wing aircraft, air traffic control, and air combat.

The timely and cost-effective leveraging of information provides a signficant advantage over adversaries not possessing comparable information processing capabilties. Among these is automatic target recognition (ATR). Under previous and current Federal funding, AbTech has developed an innovative, robust, and effective approach to automatic target recognition The approach combines the numeric processing capabilities of abductive polynomial networks with the symbolic processing power of expert systems. The result is an ATR system that intelligently processes multi-spectral imagery (i.e., laser radar, FLIR) and non-sensor information (e.g., intelligence, mission objectives) to provide a wide range of target assessment information including detection, classification, and identification. While this sytem has been developed using actual military sensor imagery, it currently operates in an engineering environment. Issues concerning its implementation on actual avionics processors have not been addressed. Therefore, ADEPT, a VHDL-based approach for determining the actual processing requirements for informatin processing algorithms, will be used to determine the implementation feasibility of the ATR system. Also, the applicability of the ASAAT methodology for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has not been considered. A complementary objective of this effort is to identify the dual-use and commercial potential for ASAAT technology."

Automated discovery of causal or deterministic behavior in sampled data provides a model of the underlying system that produces the data. Such a model can then be used to interpolate or forecast the behavior of the system under a variety of operating conditions. The ability to accurately model sampled data has a wide variety of high-payoff avioncs, electronic warfare, and other military applications. This proposal presents two existing methodologies for finding causality or patterns in data. Pattern Theory provides a framework for analytically determining the degree of ""pattern-ness"" of an existing function.

decades, however, many challenging targets remain undrugged due to limitations of
these technologies. Phage display technology presents a solution to discovering antibodies to
targets that do not elicit a strong immune response in animals, are toxic, or are difficult to
produce in large quantities in the correct conformation. Synthetic libraries, in which antibodies
are designed in silico, are a promising approach that does not rely on animal immunizations or
donors. However, most synthetic libraries in use today were constructed by fixing certain
regions of the antibody while generating random sequences from position-specific amino acid
frequencies for antigen-binding regions. This departure from the space of natural antibodies
results in antibodies with poor biophysical characteristics such as low melting temperature,
aggregation propensity, or general âstickinessâ.Digital Proteomics has developed a computational workflow for natural antibody
repertoire analysis, harnessing the throughput of next-generation sequencing of immune cells,
that will be used to design a better synthetic library for therapeutic antibody discovery. Rules of
natural antibody development will be incorporated into the design of a synthetic antibody library,
thereby retaining the biophysical property profile of natural antibodies. Antibody genes develop
through a sequential process involving site-specific genome recombination and somatic
hypermutation, which will be modeled in silico. While in conventional antibodies, this process
occurs at two independent loci (a heavy and light chain that must interact), the proof-of-concept
will be applied to the single chain antibodies produced by camelids. Using an improved
synthetic library framework, the computational design of an antibody library optimized for
therapeutic discovery will contain antibodies that display superior biophysical properties and
reduced sequence liabilities. The library will be an invaluable tool for rapid discovery of
therapeutic antibodies to a wide range of diseases.Mining large antibody libraries enables the rapid discovery of therapeutics against challenging
targets, however, current libraries have had limited success in delivering antibody therapeutics
due to poor biophysical characteristics such as low melting temperatures, aggregation
propensity, or general âstickinessâ. We propose the computational design of a better library that
uses an in silico model of natural antibody development. Combined with computational filters to
remove liabilities that preclude development as a therapeutic, our synthetic library will deliver
antibodies to treat a myriad of conditions including cancer, infectious diseases, and autoimmune
diseases."

cells, including an adaptive response to select and secrete antibodies into circulation.
Individuals who have recovered from a pathogenic infection retain immune memory and
continue to circulate pathogen-specific antibodies. For many infectious diseases like respiratory
syncytial virus, Ebola, and poxviruses, antibodies with neutralizing activity to multiple viral
strains have been discovered from human survivors. The discovered antibodies are highly
valuable as potential biologic therapeutics for the broader population, as the antibodies have
been naturally optimized to defend against human pathogens.Efforts to discover antibodies from humans recovering from coronavirus infection are
underway, SARS-CoV-2 in particular, but are hampered by the limitations of existing antibody
discovery platforms. Current approaches require screening for live B cells actively producing
pathogen-specific antibodies, which are sensitive to cell death and rarely found in blood. In
contrast, antibody protein is stable and pathogen-reactive antibodies are abundant in serum.
While protein is the ideal material to start with, characterization of polyclonal antibody (pAb)
protein presents new challenges.Recent advances in mass spectrometry and analysis have shown individual antibody
candidates can be derived from affinity-purified pAb proteins when a sufficiently matched B-cell
genetic antibody repertoire is provided. We aim to develop algorithms to supplant the need of a
genetic antibody repertoire, and de novo identify antibody candidates from limited complexity
pAb samples. This is achieved by improvements to de novo peptide sequencing using machine
learning, and targeted assembly of specificity determining regions (CDR3s) and antibody
frameworks using de Bruijn graphs. The proposed software will provide estimates of clonal
diversity and candidate sequences that can be synthesized and tested for reactivity. In addition
to addressing needs for infectious diseases, as demonstrated with an urgent unmet need to
stop the COVID-19 pandemic, the software also applies to clinical and biomedical research
needs in autoimmune disease, and commercial interests in replacing polyclonal antibody
reagents with highly reproducible monoclonal antibody equivalents.The antibody repertoire circulating in serum is the most active component to an immune
response, yet is unable to be directly queried without aid from the genetic antibody repertoire
from cells. Our innovative algorithms enable querying and sequencing of antibodies directly
from protein - opening the door to previously inaccessible autoimmune and infectious disease
research and therapeutic antibody discovery."

critical component in identifying foreign agents for removal within an organism. Produced by B
cells, antibodies have an enormously diverse set of possible compositions, created by somatic
recombination and hypermutation processes that are specific to these types of immune cells.
Due to their incredible diversity, studying them for the purpose of antibody discovery or disease
characterization, becomes a difficult task.Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have been successfully
applied to study the diverse repertoire of antibodies produced by B cells. This technology has
proven incredible for understanding this component of the immune response in a new level of
detail. Unfortunately, NGS produced strings contain errors as part of the process. These errors
can be confused as true sequence diversity, and can confound downstream analysis and
interpretation. Furthermore, structuring such deep sequenced antibody repertoire data for
answering questions about the immune response is non-trivial and compute resource intensive;
problems that not many labs are well suited to address.Our proposal seeks to break down barriers for entry of these repertoire sequencing
assays by providing innovative informatics approaches to error correction and analysis,
delivering results in an interactive cloud platform. Our service will be the first to offer
non-human/mouse species support, as well as support for transgenic animals, critical for many
drug discovery companies.Project Narrative
Antibody molecules are created by the immune system used to target cancer, pathogens, and
other foreign agents. Understanding the population of antibody molecules within a single
individual requires sequencing their nucleotide composition. This process can generate millions
of unique strings of nucleotides, of which a small proportion are erroneous. Tools for correcting,
analyzing, and visualizing such intricate datasets require improved informatics approaches to
make decisions in research and development of vaccines and drugs."

camelids and cartilagenous fish. Unlike conventional antibodies that consist of two heavy
chains and two light chains, HCAbs consist only of heavy chains. The antigen-binding portion of
the camelid HCAb, called the VHH, is a polypeptide fragment with wide utility across
crystallography, imaging, and therapeutics. The small size and comparatively simple structure
of the VHH as compared to conventional antibodies makes them economical to produce and
structurally stable at a wider pH and temperature range.Growing evidence suggests that the epitopes targeted by HCAbs are distinct from those
targeted by conventional antibodies. Concave domains, such as enzyme active sites, are one
category that are preferentially targeted by HCAbs than conventional antibodies. This is in part
due to the ability of VHHs to produce convex conformations which enables targeting of sites
that are inaccessible to conventional antibodies.Phage display is the predominant method for discovering novel VHHs. HCAb transcripts
are cloned into phagemids, and phages that express a VHH that binds the target are enriched
through the process of panning. Attrition at cloning, panning, or final selection reduces the
accessible diversity of the immune system, and delivers antibodies that may not be as diverse
as the response mounted by the original host organism.In contrast to display-based methods, Alicanto combines next-generation sequencing
and mass spectrometry to directly identify antigen-specific circulating HCAbs from camelids.
Assessment of circulating HCAbs in serum is the primary method by which an immunization is
determined to be successful. While the serum is discarded after screening in the phage display
workflow, Alicanto uses mass spectrometry to identify the individual HCAbs comprising the
target-specific circulating antibodies. This enables Alicanto to discover low abundance
antibodies against challenging targets such as peptides and small molecules. By constructing
an in silico library of HCAb sequences using next-generation sequencing, Alicanto precludes the
need to clone into an intermediate host such as phages. Through direct analysis of the immune
response of llamas, Alicanto will deliver more, high affinity VHHs for use in research,
diagnostics, and therapeutics.Single chain antibodies derived from camelids are a unique class of molecules ideally suited for
a broad range of applications including therapeutics, structural biology, and histology. Alicanto
is a novel platform for discovering single chain antibodies from llamas that rapidly delivers more,
high affinity single chain antibodies than currently available technologies. Alicanto will enable
broader use of these unique molecules across research, diagnostics, and therapeutics."

utility in many scenarios. This proposal aims to comprehensively characterize
glycoproteins, including novel and unexpected glycans, with Digital Proteomicsâ Quorum
mass spectrometry data analysis software, and enable further glycoprotein
characterization through the development of antibodies targeting discovered
glycopeptides.The Quorum software builds on the spectral networking paradigm that posits that
structurally similar molecules produce similar mass spectra. In Quorum for glycopeptide
analysis, networked spectra represent different glycan structures on the same glycosite
of a protein. Similar to traditional approaches to glycopeptide identification, Quorum
matches glycopeptide spectra to a protein sequence database and glycan structure
database. Unlike traditional approaches, Quorum employs a rigorous false-discovery
rate calculation based on variant glycan structures in target-decoy analysis. In addition,
Quorum increases the identification rate of glycopeptides by propagating identifications
along edges in the network, enabling the discovery of glycan structures that are not in
the structure database and may be completely novel.Quorum will be benchmarked on glycoprotein standards, well-characterized
NIST monoclonal antibody reference material, and total IgG which will establish a
baseline for spectral network variant glycopeptide discovery. The Quorum software is
deployed to the cloud, as part of our extensible platform Quorum Cloud, where the
glycoprotein analysis is a plugin to generic spectral networking analysis. Enlisted testers
of the cloud platform have applications in glycoengineering, glycoenrichment assays,
and therapeutic development.Glycans are key modulators of protein stability and function, and play critical roles in
host-pathogen interactions, cancer metastasis, and immunology. Research into protein
glycosylation is hampered by inadequate tools to identify the full diversity of glycan structures on

destruction and severe disability if untreated. There is no cure for RA and up to 50% of RA patients do not
respond to anti-TNF therapies as circulating Th-17/IL-17 levels are highly elevated subsequent to TNF
blockade. For this subset of RA patients, disruption of a novel pathway that impairs the synergy between TNF
(M1 macrophages) and IL-17 (Th-17 cells) cascades may resolve the critical barrier in RA treatment. Hence
objective of this project is to develop a therapeutic human TLR5 antibody (Ab) for RA patients whose disease
is driven by the cross-talk between the effector macrophages and T cells.We documented that ligation of TLR5 to its natural ligand expressed in the joints, transforms RA
peripheral blood (PB) cells into proinflammatory M1 macrophages which produce high levels of TNF, IL-1 and
IL-6. In addition, IL-6 produced from TLR5 driven M1 macrophages can differentiate the naÃ¯ve T cells into
inflammatory RA TH-17 cells that secrete IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, IL-24, IL-26, CCL20 and GM-CSF. In mice,
systemic and local injection of a TLR5 agonist exacerbates joint swelling; conversely anti-TLR5 Ab treatment
alleviates collagen induced arthritis (CIA) joint inflammation.To investigate the role of TLR5 Ab as a potential treatment for RA, we have partnered with scientists at
Abwiz Inc. Using a TLR5 antigen, a human fragment antigen-binding (Fab) phage display library was screened
for TLR5 high affinity binders. Up to 40 positive clones were sequenced and 10 selected TLR5 Fab clones
were expressed, purified and assessed by ELISA for TLR5 binding and cross reactivity. Ten Fab clones were
examined by the Shahrara lab for TLR5 neutralization capacity in human and murine cells and one was
selected based on its superior blocking capacity.The overall goal of this project is to develop an anti-TLR5 Ab for RA therapy. In Phase I, our approach
is to enhance the affinity of anti-TLR5 Ab in order to reach a Kd value that is within the range of commercially
available Abs. Candidates provided through site directed mutagenesis using phage-display Ab library, will be
tested for their TLR5 blocking affinity in human cells. Subsequently, the most promising candidates will be
tested for their ability to abrogate RA synovial fluid from promoting inflammatory response in humanized RA
mouse model. The long term goal of this project is to generate a safe and completely novel TLR5 Ab for RA
patients that do not respond to the current therapies.A receptor has been identified in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, which can strongly promote joint
inflammation and bone erosion. We show strong evidence that blocking the function of this receptor potently
alleviates the inflammatory response and bone loss in RA and preclinical models. The goal of this proposal is
to engineer a highly specific antibody against the identified receptor so that it can be used as a potential
therapy in RA patients."

Central Nervous System (CNS) physical injuries, including bacterial or viral infection, can induce
chronic neuroinflammation that is believed to persist for the lifetime of an individual. Among the other
inflammatory events, it is recognized that both acute and chronic activation of the complement pathway plays a
role in the development of secondary brain injuries by inducing neuronal cell loss and synaptic pruning.
Complement over-activation is also firmly implicated in the pathology that underlies the irreversible progression
of multiple sclerosis (MS), a common inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the CNS. We hypothesize
that therapeutic inhibition of the complement system and concurrent stimulation of nerve growth may prevent
CNS tissue damage and slow or even block the progression of MS.
Currently, the main obstacle for drug delivery to the CNS is the presence of a selectively permeable blood-brain
barrier (BBB), limiting blood-borne proteinsandapos; entryinto the CNS. To overcome this issue, we have recently
developed several potent camelid-derived nanobodies. The first group of nanobodies can inhibit complement
activation, whereas the second group comprises tyrosine kinase receptor TrkB agonists that mimic the action of
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a growth factor in the brain that promotes neuronal survival, synaptic
plasticity and neurogenesis. Here, we propose to engineer these nanobodies further to facilitate their crossing
of the BBB, thereby gaining the ability to more effectively inhibit the complement cascade and/or stimulate nerve
growth within the CNS.
During phase I, bispecific nanobodies will be produced and validated in in vitro cellular functional assays.
Therapeutic efficacy will be further validated in a well-characterized murine model of progressive MS, the
Theilerandapos;s murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD). To this end, mice will be
treated with control nanobodies, a complement inhibitor nanobody, TrkB agonistic nanobody, or a combination
of the latter two. Once therapeutic efficacy is confirmed in TMEV-IDD, the camelid-derived nanobodies will be
humanized to reduce antigenicity in humans.
Statistically significant improvement in treated mice monitored as an impact on disability progression and CNS
pathology will be the foundation for a phase II submission. The goals of phase II are 1) revalidate the therapeutic
efficacy of humanized antibodies in more extensive experiments, including a detailed analysis of the effect of
sex, age, dose-ranges and delayed treatments, i.e., later than 30 days post-infection, on disability progression,
disease pathology and recovery; 2) to establish manufacturing protocols under current Good Manufacturing
Practice conditions and; 3) to define the biological response, PK/PD, dose-ranging and toxicology in multiple
model animals, including toxicology studies in non-human primates.Narrative: As result of this project, first in class complement inhibiting and neurotropic antibody therapeutics
capable of crossing the blood brain barrier for treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis will be obtained."

Each day, global poultry industry staff would ideally like to determine the gender of > 150 million newly hatched birds. Currently, this can be done only manually at the hatchery, which is a virtually impossible undertaking. Automated gender sorting of eggs prior to hatching could resolve many problems associated with manual gender segregation. Previously, we and others have shown that the estrogen concentration in allantoic fluids of embryonated eggs is sex-dependent. In this proposal, the development of instant estrogen sensors is proposed, which will offer the poultry industry the potential to standardize and to automate gender sorting prior to hatching. In Phase I, we will be develop allosteric riboswitch estrogen sensors which are composed of an estrogen-binding RNA aptamer domain juxtaposed to a ribozyme domain capable of self-cleavage in the presence of its target molecule. The sensors will be validated for estrogen detection in vitro using male and female allantoic fluids from 17-day embryonated eggs. In Phase II, the sensors will be validated and optimized for differentiating female embryos from male embryos by directly injecting the sensors into allantoic fluid chambers and the emitted fluorescent signal will be detected. By the end of phase II, the sensors will be produced in a large scale and undergo extensive field test.As the result of this project, a novel technology platform for automation sex-sorting eggs prior hatching will be developed. The sensors will provide a low cost mean to automatically segregate male from female eggs in the poultry industry to gain feed efficiency, improve production management and significantly increase profitability."

Low calorie sweeteners like Saccharin, Aspartame, Cyclamate and Acesulfame K are popular with patients affected by diseases caused by the consumption of sugar, e.g. diabetes, hyperlipemia, caries, obesity etc. Unfortunately, these sweeteners are linked to serious side effects such as psychological problems, mental disorders, bladder cancer, heart failure and brain tumors. Naturally occurring sweet and taste modifying proteins that are a thousand times sweeter than sucrose have been identified in several exotic fruits and are seen as potential replacements for the currently available artificial low calorie sweeteners. Hence, the project goal is to develop a low cost approach to produce a sweet protein. During phase I, probiotic yeast will be engineered for high yield production of either secreted protein or protein displayed on the yeast cell surface that are accessible to taste receptors. The sweetening activity of purified sweet protein and yeast with surface displayed sweet protein will be validated by a sensory panel. This work will be the foundation for full product development (Phase II) and eventual commercialization that will be completed within a 2-year period. The unique value proposition of the product lies in low cost production of heat stable sweet proteins by probiotic microorganism to replace sugar in sugary foods and drinks. The products will have a highly beneficial impact on the reduction of carbohydrate consumption without compromising the sweet taste.

While antiretroviral therapy is effective and increasingly available, the standard of care requires periodic monitoring of patients' viral load to individualize treatment and to control the emergence and spread of drug- resistant strains of HIV. Currently, viral-load is most commonly assessed with quantitative PCR-based or branched chain DNA assays, which require expensive equipment, infrastructure, and skilled technicians, which are not readily available in resource-limited settings. As a result, man HIV patients are not subjected to the recommended periodic, viral load testing. AC Diagnostics (ACD), in collaboration with University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), will develop inexpensive, automated, fully-integrated, point of care devices for molecular-based detection and quantification of HIV-1 in blood. The core of the technology is a novel, multifunctional, isothermal enzymatic amplification reactor for nucleic acid detection that utilizes a membrane capture scaffold to isolate nucleic acids from complex samples without prior purification and without a need for elution, thereby greatly simplifying flow control andenabling molecular diagnostic devices that are just slightly more complicated than dipsticks and, yet, have nearly comparable performance of benchtop equipment. Our preliminary experiments indicate that the proposed device can detect as few as 10 HIV copies per sample (i.e., less than 100 copies/ml of blood) in less than 60 minutes. Competing technologies currently under development utilize expensive and complex processors and may be unaffordable in many regions of the world. Phase I will provide proof of concept and target clade B and clade C HIV-1 subtypes. By appropriate selection of primers and without any modifications in hardware, the device can be modified to detect other clades according to the region of use. The proposed technology will also enableearly detection of HIV-1 during the highly contagious pre- seroconversion acute-stage of infection to facilitate early treatment and minimize the spread of the disease (which is particularly important with increasing emphasize on test-and-treat and treatment-as-prevention concepts). Yet another important application is the diagnosis of infection in babies born to HIV-infected mothers since persistent maternal antibody makes traditional testing impossible. Such babies are typically started on therapy without testing, resulting in overtreatment of the majority to save the few infected. Our technology can help prevent unneeded exposure and expense. Although the proposed technology is particularly needed in developing countries, it is anticipated that both the instrumented (quantitative) and qualitative devices will also have market niche in the developed world, especially in places located far from major medical centers; in settings when real-time decisions based on viral load measures may be beneficial, and would likely improve efficiency, patients' convenience, adherence to drug therapy, and enable more timely, treatment decisions. Our devices can also be used for home testing to provide early detection.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed STTR effort will lead to a new generation of point-of-care (POC), molecular (nucleic acid)-based diagnostic devices that will enable the monitoring of the viral load of HIV in patients undergoing therapy and screening for HIV infection in individuals at risk during the seroconversion period and in babies born to AIDS- infected mothers when antibody tests are ineffective. The proposed device will foster improved healthcare both in resource-poor settings and in developed countries."

Microbial infections and outbreaks threaten the survival or utility of biomedical animal models used in current and future research. It is therefore crucial to accurately and timely identify current and emerging pathogens in labanimal populations and facilities to assure pathogen-free biological resources. Current diagnostic methods for the animal pathogens are time-consuming and expensive, and are therefore mainly limited to large research or diagnostic laboratories. There is nocommercial product available for routine applications. Consequently, automated, simple-to- operate technologies as standardized or user configurable commercial products are urgently needed for rapid, reliable and cost-effective detection and identification of the pathogenic microbes in laboratory animal populations and settings. The technology proposed in this project integrates automated viral RNA isolation from raw samples and real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) detection into asensitive, reliable and low-cost (lt  10) diagnostic system. We anticipate a limit of detection of less than 10 viruses, and test times within 60 minutes. The primary specific aims of Phase I are to develop a prototype assay system and demonstrate its feasibility for detecting animal viruses in blood. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an on-site assay device which is consisted of single-use (disposable) self-contained credit-card sized assay cassette and a fully- automated portable detector for completely automated detection of laboratory animal viruses. The final product will be fully developed and validated in the Phase II of this project. The successful completion of this project will significantly advance animal virus detection, and provide a simple on-site assay device with minimum operator attention or skill requirement. The same technology can also be used as a platform for other pathogens such as viruses in nonhuman primates and bacterial pathogens, and as a part of standardized operation procedures in daily laboratory animal care. 1 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The successful completion of this project will significantly advance the technique of virus detection, and provide a general platform for the detection of other animal pathogens such as viruses in nonhuman primates and bacterial pathogens. This novel device will have widespread applicability as a standardized and streamlined commercial product and procedure for rapid, reliable and cost-effective detection and identificationof the microbes in laboratory animal cares. Therefore it will meet the requirements for establishing pathogen-free biological resources for current and future biomedical research needs."

Early and accurate detection of HLB pathogens in infected asymptomatic citrus plants is a crucial step for implementing timely measures to eliminate bacterial infections and prevent further epidemic spread among crops. Current detection methods such as conventional PCR may not provide the sensitivity needed for asymptomatic citrus samples. Nested-PCR is costly and time-consuming, and more importantly, has a high risk of cross-contamination. In this proposal, we propose to develop a novel surveillance system, a single-tube nested real-time PCR for ultrasensitive detection of HLB Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus in the citrus samples with extremely low bacterial titer. With the proposed technology, the PCR assay procedure is greatly simplified, and the cost of processing each sample is significantly reduced. This makes it possible to process large numbers of samples in a relative short time period in a high through-put diagnostic system. This system will be designed to provide a useful and accurate diagnostic tool for the management and prevention of HLB diseases. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a reliable diagnostic system to meet the challenges and demands for sensitive and cost-effective detection of HLB, currently the most devastating disease of citrus. The final product of the surveillance system is a single-tube nested-PCR test kit for sensitive detection of HLB pathogen. The HLB diagnostic kit will include all assay components in a ready-to-use format, which allows an entire PCR assay, from target RNA amplification to amplicon detection, to be performed in a single reaction tube. A prototype assay system will be developed in Phase I, and will be optimized and validated with field samples in Phase II. The goal of this proposal is to develop the HLB surveillance system with sensitive, reliable and user-friendly commercial products for HLB detection and monitoring. This HLB assay system will be useful in national citrus certification programs, plant diagnostic network systems, pathogen elimination programs, state and federal plant quarantine programs, as well as routine application in research and diagnostic laboratories."

The first line of defense against such devastating viral diseases is the early and sensitive detection of the viruses before they are introduced into the U.S, or once in the U.S. before it has become widespread. Since there is no effective method to cure plant of virus diseases, eradication of introduced virus inoculum sources through early detection may prevent the harmful pathogens from further spreading into existing and newly planted crops, and thus reducing production costs and environmental impacts of introduced viruses. It has long been a challenging task to develop timely and accurate diagnostic tests for diseases caused by viruses or virus-like agents in plants in agriculture production. Traditional methods for detecting plant pathogenic viruses include biological assay on indicator plants, serological tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immuno-strips, and electron microscopy. Biological indexing assays are time-consuming taking weeks or even months to complete. Serological tests may not provide the sensitivity that is needed to detect low concentrations of viruses in seeds and plant tissues. Modern technologies such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) provide very sensitive diagnostic assays for plant virus detection. However, these molecular techniques require lab-intensive and expensive procedures of pre-sample extraction and post-PCR detection, which make it very difficult or infeasible to test large numbers of samples. By combining two widely used virus detection methods, ELISA and RT-PCR, Immunocapture Real-time RT-PCR is proposed for the detection of plant viruses in this SBIR project. The advantages of this assay system over conventional RT-PCR include eliminating pre- and post-PCR manipulations, improving sensitivity, reducing risks from contamination, and shortening the time needed for an accurate disease diagnosis. Savings on labor and materials in sample preparation significantly reduces the total cost for each test. This immunocapture Real-time RT-PCR assay will provide one of the most sensitive diagnostic tools for detection of plant viruses in many economically important crops. Sensitive, reliable and user-friendly commercial products will be developed based on this technology. It allows us to perform an entire assay in a single PCR reaction tube within a relatively short time. This cost-effective diagnostic system will be of benefit to research scientists, inspectors, growers and diagnosticians, and thus, improve crop protection, increase production efficiency and increase environmental benefits. Therefore, it will directly enhance protection and safety of the nation's agriculture and food supply, and also indirectly enhance international competitiveness of American agriculture and protect the nation's natural resource base and environment."

Early and accurate detection of pant viruses in infested seeds and stock plants is a crucial step to eliminate virus infections and prevent further epidemiological spread among crop plants. Current virus detection is generally performed through the use of biological indexing on indicator plants, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In general, bio-indexing is time consuming and labor intensive. Although conventional RT-PCR offers greater sensitivity, it is not cost-effective and difficult to scale-up for high throughput samples. Currently, ELISA remains to be one of the best methods for plant virus detection. A sensitive immunocapture Real-time RT-PCR assay combines the advantages from two widely used virus detection methods, ELISA and RT-PCR to achieve timely and sensitive detection of plant viruses with simple sample preparation by immunocapture technology. This technology provides numerous advantages, including improving sensitivity, reducing contamination risks, eliminating pre- and post-PCR manipulations, and shortening the time needed for large sample diagnosis. This proposal presents the development of a sensitive and early surveillance system for plant viruses in crop plants using this technology. The first objective is to determine the factors affecting the efficient immunocapture of Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) for Real-time RT-PCR analysis of tomato seed and plant tissues. The second objective is to develop a sensitive and early surveillance system to a panel of 14 tomato viruses using immunocapture Real-time RT-PCR. Once the phase I project is successful, this same strategy could be applied to develop disease surveillance systems for plant viruses in many of the economically important vegetables, fruits, ornamentals and agronomical crops. The goal of this proposal is to develop sensitive, reliable and user-friendly commercial products for routine plant virus detection basin on immunocapture Real-time RT-PCR. This cost-effective and use-friendly detection system will greatly benefit to the growers or companies with limited sources at their diagnostic labs. This novel diagnostic technology based on the immunocapture Real-time RT-PCR will significantly improve plant disease diagnostics by accurate, rapid and cost-effective identification of causal agents in agronomic or specialty crop plants at the earliest possible time relative to manifestation of disease. Therefore, it will improve crop protection resulting in reduced production costs and increased environmental benefits, and enhance protection and safety of the nation&#039;s agriculture and food supply."

In the United States, disproportionately high rates of sexually transmitted infection (STI) and unplanned pregnancy among adolescents suggest the continuing need for evidence-based sexuality education. Efforts to address sexual health through traditional educational venues, principally schools, play an important role in targeting this recalcitrant problem; however, there remains a substantial gap between current sexual health understanding, current epidemiological outcomes, and targeted objectives. Other emerging venues appear to offer an opportunity to increase delivery of accurate and appropriate sexual health information and educational activities. Moving beyond traditional educational providers, community-based organizations (CBOs) have been identified as venues with significant potential to promote adolescent sexual health. Within CBOs, youth development professionals (YDP) are important sources of sexuality education for adolescents; however, recent research documents a need for systematic training and accessible resources for YDP and indicates that the YDP themselves desire ongoing education and support. CBO-based YDP are called upon to conduct reactive sexual health education-to respond to questions. They also frequently participate in proactive efforts-conducting workshops and outreach. Moreover, they, and their organizations, have little support in doing so. Innovation. To address the unique opportunity afforded by CBO-based YDP, we propose to extendemerging research, conducted by members of our team, by examining roles CBO-based YDP play in sexual health education, counseling, and support. Based on the results of those research efforts, we will develop and validate a CBO implementation toolkit: a wide ranging set of resources to enhance effective CBO implementation of proactive and reactive sexual health education and counseling. The toolkit will address issues from organizational readiness to YDP education to materials and resources for provision toCBO clients and client- parents. Although the effort will make use of innovative media and technologies-including multimedia, interactivity, social networking, and smart phone compatible delivery-the emphasis, and innovation, is the specific health problemand the holistic, educationally and behaviorally sound, integrated, approach to this problem, with technologies as tools to augment adoption and implementation to the extent that the technologies are accessible by CBO's, the YDPs, and their clients, and where supportive of targeted outcomes. Phase I will extend current YDP research by using community-based participatory research methods with a national sample of YDP from a broad range of organizations, design the overall CBO toolkit, develop a subset of these educational and support tools, and test those materials formatively within single-subject usability sessions and in a summative field trial. Phase II will develop the entire suite of materials and conduct a large- scale trial to validate them prior towidespread dissemination. Our proposed effort will: Specific Aim 1. Improve upon what is known about the role of YDP as sexual health educators by examining their information and skills needs, their understanding of evidence-based sexual health for adolescents, and the sexual health program/intervention needs of their organizations (CBOs). Specific Aim 2. Improve sexual health efforts of CBO-based YDP by developing resources to address: a. Reactive Education: Increase YDP efficacy for evidence-based responses to sexual health questions and increase YDP capacity to use behavioral change messages and interventions. b. Proactive Education: Increase frequency, accuracy, and effectiveness of outreach and educational efforts by YDP; increase YDP awareness of selves as sexual health models. c. Organizational Adoption: Enable CBOs, as organizations, to assess readiness, to assess effectiveness, and to develop a systematic approach to providing evidence-based sexual health programming. The proposed research effortwill be an important contribution to the understanding of CBO-based YDP sexual health educational efforts and will also lead to the development and validation of innovative educational and performance support tools in an area where none currently exist."

Faith leaders and clergy have been identified in national strategic public health documents as important front-line gatekeepers for suicide prevention. Preliminary research by the Indiana Partnership to Prevent Violent Injury and Death (IPPVID) has identified strong interest among clergy in training materials regarding suicide prevention. However, to date, no evidence-based training materials are available to facilitate adoption of suicide-related risk reduction and mitigation behaviors among faith leaders. The goal of this project is to fill this need by developing and validating evidence-based and theory-driven training materials to increase suicide awareness and suicide prevention skills among faith leaders. Across both phases, a multipronged approach will be used to generate the content of the faith leaders&#039; suicide prevention curriculum: the effort will (1) capitalize on a pilot curriculum developed by our research partner (IPPVID), (2) draw upon emerging suicide prevention training programs for mental health professionals and general audiences that can be tailored to the specific practical and sociocultural needs of faith leaders, and (3) involve stakeholders and subject-matter experts in the articulation and validation of the curriculum outlines, lessons, and learning activities. Design and development of educational lessons and activities will be guided by a constructivist pedagogical theory, an integrated performance support model, and a well- established instructional design process. Phase I will deliver an overall curriculum design document by conducting structured audience analysis regarding faith leaders&#039; needs, barriers, and common situations as well as content analysis of existing suicide training curricula. Interviews (n=20) with clergy will elicit factors affecting engagement in the target behaviors and will gather reactions to existing curricula; a survey (n=200) of identified beliefs will be conducted, and the results of the survey will drive motivational and other elements of the media. Content from IPPVID pilot trials will be further refined through the multipronged approach described above. Phase I will then develop prototype web-based interactive lessons and activities focusing primarily on awareness and risk identification. The resulting lessons and activities will be evaluated in a small scale RCT (n=60).PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Suicide prevention is a vital public health concern. A large number of individuals use religious leaders as their first and often primary source of mental health support. Faith leaders have been identified as important points of leverage for addressing suicide through their ability to directly and immediately engage in identification, brief diffusion, and referral of individuals at risk. Yet faith leaders are often not adequately prepared for this role. There currently exist no evidence-based suicide prevention educational programs tailored for faith leaders&#039; particular practical, organizational, and cultural workplace needs. This project will develop a suicide prevention professional development curriculum customized to the unique needs of faith leaders. The curriculum will draw upon existing evidence-based suicide training efforts and state-of-the-art pedagogical theory and technology. It will be deliverable as individualized instruction over the web as well as through facilitator led training. The proposed effort meets an important, recognized, need with an innovative, easily dessiminable, and customizable educational solution. As such, the resulting products should be well-received by faith leaders and their organizations as well as institutions which provide pre-professional and continuing education to them."

Estimates of prevalence in the long-term and extended care environments cluster around 8% and appear stable over the past decade. An estimated 30% of new entrants to homebound care are at risk for developing pressure ulcers. Yet it has been forcefully argued that pressure ulcers are largely preventable regardless of a patient&#039;s Braden Risk profile when proper precautionary standards of practice are followed. While reduction to zero may be unrealistic, especially in the near-term as a result of institutional, systemic, and individual factors endemic to the U.S. health care system, nonetheless a reduction from the present rates of incidence in long-term and homebound care is feasible and would yield human and financial savings through diminution of patient sequelae and co-morbidity. Improvement in adherence to standard prevention, treatment, and management practices is a reasonable and worthwhile objective. The Academic Edge, Inc. (AEI) is developing a suite of educational materials and support resources to address prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers. These are to be delivered via web as well as other media. The materials will be interactive, accurate, effective, and extensible. The media and site will address pressure ulcers in terms of both prevention and treatment and will target home health aides (HHA), nurses and other supervisory personnel, and, to a lesser, but no less important extent, patients and their families. In Phase 1, AEI demonstrated the feasibility of the effort by identifying salient HHA beliefs, generating core content and design documents, evaluating those documents through end-user focus groups and subject-matter-expert (SME) reviews, and by producing a video covering a portion of the content and conducting a field trial of that video. Phase 2 will develop two interactive courses, a web portal of pressure ulcer information, and job aids and other performance support tools to increase performance of four key objectives: (1) monitoring for signs of pressure ulcers, (2) taking active steps to identify, monitor, and mitigate risk factors, (3) managing pressure ulcers using current standard practices, and (4) supervising others who interact with those at risk for pressure ulcer formation. These will be developed using a theory-based design and development model and will be evaluated continuously using focus groups and advisory panel reviews. The core content and courses will also be evaluated in two sets of field trials: an initial small scale formative (n=20) validation trial for each course that ensures everything is working correctly in each course and a set of larger summative trials (n=440, home health care personnel; n=120 nursing students) that evaluate the effectiveness of the effort. Pressure ulcers are a significant problem in long-term care. The number of individuals receiving long- term homebound care has increased rapidly in the last decade. Home health aides represent the fastest growing occupation in the U.S., with a projected growth rate of 56% over the 2004-2014 period, adding some 350,000 jobs in that same period. Although most home health aides appear to be willing to take steps to reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers, there presently exists no standardized, friendly, and effective training on pressure ulcers and their prevention for the HHA field. What little training does exist generally targets more advanced practitioners and does so through books and other paper-based media. A readily available, evidence-based, and theory driven set of interactive courses, tools, and resources for individual and small group training, developed in multiple media, should be extremely well-received by home health organizations, can be adapted to be used in broader applications, such as pre-professional nursing training, and will positively affect this important, and mostly preventable, public health concern."

The WSTDtv project addresses the need for a readily available, developmentally appropriate, engaging, and effective HIV/STD awareness and prevention curriculum for schools. By combining multimedia activities, web-based resources, and electronic and print teacher support tools and strategies, WSTDtv will deliver a set of activities from which adolescents are able to learn facts and science about HIV/STD, ways to deal with pressures and influences related to sexual activity in their daily lives, and the skills necessary to reduce their level of risk. Phase 1 developed a significant prototype CD-ROM, web site, and teacher's guide. The preliminary CD-ROM is of commercial quality, as exhibited by the multiple industry awards it received, even in its prototype form. In a pre-post pilot evaluation (n=41), the interactive activities were found to significantly increase adolescent knowledge, to affect targeted attitudes in the desired direction, and to significantly exceed target usability, interest, and usefulness benchmarks. In an evaluation of the teacher's guide, web site, and CD-ROM by middle school teachers (n=17), the teachers were overwhelmingly positive about the product. These results are noteable, even more so considering they were obtained with a Phase 1 prototype which, while extensive, was limited in the number and range of activities, the scope of content, and the opportunities for direct training in and practice with risk-reducing and interpersonal skills. In Phase 2, existing modules will be refined and expanded. New modules on STD facts, risk factors, and prevention skills building will be produced. The web site will be enhanced to include search mechanisms and additional content directly linked to individual modules. Mechanisms for teacher-friendly online ""booster"" modules and inter-class collaboration will be created, including login architecture, web conferencing, online voting, and other features. The teachers guide will be extended and additional teacher support tools designed. Phase 2 will be evaluated through six stages of focus groups, through in-depth review by a nationally recognized advisory panel, and through a randomized controlled product evaluation. Also during Phase 2, marketing and distribution plans and agreements will be finalized. The 2005 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that 46.8% of high school students had had sexual intercourse during their life and that 33.9% of them had engaged in sexual intercourse with one or more persons during the three months preceding the survey. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimates there are 19 million new cases of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) in the United States each year and that almost half of them occur in 15 to 24 year olds (2004). There is little doubt that teens are sexually active and that many of them are engaging in unsafe sexual practices. Schools are an ideal venue for health promotion and disease prevention programs, and most adolescents receive at least a minimum amount of sexuality or HIV education; however, in general it is believed that STD/HIV curricula are not as effective as they could be (Kirby,2002). Interactive media offers new ways for delivering STD/HIV prevention content-ways that can be attractive to both teachers and students. A readily available, research-based, and theory driven set of innovative and engaging interactive activities, tools, and resources should be very well-received by students, teachers, schools, and local educational authorities and will fill an important gap in public health education. Intended to address this gap, the effort proposed herein describes the development of WSTDtv - an STD/HIV curriculum for use by teachers in middle school and early secondary school classrooms."

The CDC found the warni

labels, and educational media that convey the danger of taking teratogenic pharmaceuticals while pregnant or preconceptional. Following ANSI guidelines for symbol development and evaluation, the researchers canvassed existing symbols, generated root concep
ts, and internally developed preliminary candidate images and styles for a new symbol. As the project ensued, focus groups were conducted. The purpose of the focus groups shifted over time from generation of new symbol, text, and label ideas to evaluation
of pre-developed symbols, text, and text symbol combinations. A final set of six pilot symbols were selected. The six pilot symbols were evaluated in a nationally distributed field trial that utilized a one-on-one interview methodology (n=300, 50 per image
). The evaluation demonstrated significant progress toward a validated pharmaceutical label. Results have been accepted for publication. Phase II will further refine and validate the pharmaceutical symbol and label, create a series of similar symbols and w
arnings for use in other settings and with other hazards, and create a series of educational media modules to increase awareness of the symbols and warnings and to educate professionals and the public on teratogenicity. These materials will include a multi
media module, a reference web-site, a set of brochures for pharmacies and practitioners and small media materials for display. All materials will be delivered in both English and Spanish. Licensing and commercialization of the symbols and media will be sou
ght through standards organizations, FDA, and corporate sponsors."

 intervention techniques. Given the limited time physicians (and other health
 care professionals) can provide to each family, such tools are essential for
 informed patient families and effective clinical practice -- and do not

PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:
The IMI will be a cost-effective means of providing social problem-solving treatment to large numbers of students. The IMI is particularly commercially viable since recent legislation mandates that schools develop effective interventions for children with disruptive, aggressive behavior problems, a trend with is likely to continue as concepts such as the Safe School effort come increasingly to the forefront."

 Methadone is a synthetic opioid used to treat pain and as maintenance therapy
for opiate addicted individuals Methadone does not have the euphoric properties of
morphine and thus is less addictive Its use in the treatment of both acute and chronic
pain thus offers advantage However limiting methadone s clinical use is its
prolongation of the cardiac cell s repolarization time manifested as QT prolongation
which is associated with ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death Female
patients are especially at risk due to an already longer repolarization time than in men
Additionally low serum potassium cardiac ion channel abnormalities as well as low
magnesium can increase the patients risk when taking methadone We have found in
pre clinical studies that the R isomer of methadone causes significantly less QT
prolongation reducing arrhythmia risk Given the potential for lethal arrhythmias
methadone poses a serious public health problem with potentially tens of thousands of
patients at risk R methadone would be a safer alternative for pain therapy This
proposal entails studying an abuse deterrent formulation of methadone as to its
pharmacokinetic properties Studies would be initiated in Beagle dogs to evaluate
kinetics along with QT effects of R methadone as contrasted to R S methadone the
standard mixture available for therapeutic use in the U S
 These studies will initiate the development of a cardiac safer formulation of
methadone that could not be tampered with and that would be safer for patients
especially women and those with potassium channelopathies or patients with
hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia Project Narrative
Methadone is an effective drug used as a pain killer and to help patients addicted to
opiates to avoid illicit substances when placed on a methadone maintenance program
However methadone causes QT prolongation and is a risk factor for sudden death
 more so in women and patients with certain hereditary conditions  One isolated minor
image of the compound called the R isomer causes much less QT prolongation and
thus less arrhythmic risk We propose to study the R isomer in an abuse deterrent
formulation as to its pharmacokinetics initially in dogs as a prelude to human studies So
we know the amount to give and how often"

However, methadone prolongs the QT interval on the electrocardiogram and this increases risk for life threatening arrhythmias and has led to the FDA's placing a black box warning on methadone's label. Initial studies in our laboratory have shown that one of the stereoisomers of methadone causes significantly less QT prolongation and this isomer possesses the analgesic effect of methadone. The studies outlined in the grant propose to confirm the safety of the R isomer in a model to access proarrhythmia that the FDA proposes for the animal evaluation of arrhythmic risk and then to determine if the isomer causes less QT prolongation in the dog at therapeutic and higher than routine therapeutic doses of R methadone as compared to racemic methadone. These are necessary steps for the submission of a new drug application and the eventual commercial availability of the methadone isomer as a safer treatment for analgesia and addiction.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Methadone is frequently used for pain treatment and drug addiction, but the current formulation poses a serious risk of arrhythmias. The R isomer of methadone does not cause the same electrophysiologic changes (QT prolongation) and thus would not pose the same risk for arrhythmias. Studies in this grant set out to show that the R isomer is a safer methadone and would pose less of a risk for life threatening arrhythmias to patient."

However, the Tween 80 and benzyl alcohol diluents limits the rate of administration severely, due to hypotension and myocardial contractile depression. These adverse toxicities contribute to the high mortality of cardiac arrest patients who have marked myocardial depression due to prolonged hypoxia. A new formulation in an acetate buffer solution, pH 3.8 has been developed permitting bolus administration of amiodarone. However, the new preparation causes significantly more phlebitis when administered by peripheral vein. A reformulated preparation of amiodarone not in an acetate buffer, at pH 6.8 is currently under study. The formulation will not possess the pediatric toxicity that the benzyl alcohol causes, that in clinical studies resulted in deaths in pediatric patients, halting further clinical trials to obtain a pediatric indication for amiodarone. Additionally the new, neutral pH formulation should reduce the hypotension and phlebitis caused by all current amiodarone formulations. Studies proposed in this grant aim to establish the anti-arrhythmic efficacy, the reduced hypotension and reduced phlebitis that the newer preparation of amiodarone with the more neutral pH offers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: IV amiodarone is the most effective cardiac emergency anti-arrhythmic available. It is first line emergency therapy for cardiac arrest patients as recommended by ACLS guidelines. The current formulation has Tween 80 and benzyl alcohol that causes hypotension, negative inotrophy and pediatric toxicity (phlebitis and mortality). API has developed a formulation of amiodarone in an acetate buffer, pH 3.8 but this causes a higher incidence of phlebitis when administered into peripheral veins. The phlebitis limits the pediatric utility of the preparation. Additionally, benzyl alcohol may be fatal in the newborn, infant and small child. A reformulation of the IV amiodarone preparation has yielded a stable product at pH 6.8 that does not contain any potentially toxic diluent. The studies proposed in this grant aim to evaluate the new formulation for phlebitis, hypotension and anti-arrhythmic effectiveness in animals; requisite steps in the development of a viable product for the pediatric population. At the successful completion of the pre-clinical studies, a bioequivalence study in adults would be requisite for FDA approval based on a Special Protocol Assessment granted by FDA."

Digoxin increases cardiac contractility and blocks conduction through the AV node slowing the ventricular response to AF and thus slowing the rate of the beating ventricles permitting more time for the heart to fill. The recent Dig trial supports the use of digoxin in the treatment of CHF and the recent AFIRM trial supports the rate control strategy for AF treatment. Digoxin is believed to augment contractility by inhibition of NaK+ATP&#039;ace as well as of AV node delay by this mechanism. However, the inhibition of NaK+ATP&#039;ace is initiated by digoxin binding to the alpha subunit and three different subunits exist. Digoxin is a chiral molecule and it is possible that the chiral isolates of digoxin exhibit different binding affinities for the alpha subunits yielding different effects on cardiac contractility and AV node conduction. In preliminary studies we have been able to isolate two isomers and find differential effects on conduction and contractility. We propose to further expand the preliminary work, confirm the differential action on the two isolates in a second species; both requisite preliminary steps to developing the two compounds as independent pharmaceutical agents. Additionally we propose studies to identify the isolates as to chemical structure, determine their stability in vitro and in vivo as well as develop methods to increase the yield of the isolates at chiral separation. We further propose to determine the toxic to therapeutic ratio of the isolates to see if they offer an advantage to the racemate digoxin compound. The advantage would be a treatment for AF that did not cause cardiac augmentation and vasoconstriction or a treatment for CHF that does not cause heart rate slowing or conduction disturbances."

The buffet problem occurs when vortices emanating from the leading-edge extension of a delta wing break down before reaching the vertical tails. The resultant Unsteady unbalanced loads on the vertical tails can cause premature fatigue failure. A variety of methods for controlling the buffet problem have been proposed, but none have been definitively demonstrated as being an optimal solution. The proposed effort will utilize a state-of-the-art multi-disciplinary computing environment (MDICE) to evaluate the efficacy of a variety of proposed buffet-control methodologies and to design the optimum methodologies under a variety of flight conditions. MDICE will be configured with a computational fluid dynamics module (CFDFASTRAN), a structure dynamics module, and a conservative-consistent technique for fluid-structure interfacing. A controls module will be added when necessary to model certain active control methodologies. The Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of the computational environment for prediction and control of twin-tail buffet. In this effort, the twin-tail buffet responses of a generic fighter aircraft will be computed and validated against the available experimental data. The effort will then be extended to apply three basic flow control methods under a specified set of flight conditions. Under Phase II, the computational environment will be expanded by developing and evaluating the efficacy of a comprehensive set of flow and structure control methodologies for twin-tail buffet alleviation under a wide range of flight conditions. The resulting optimum methodology or combination of methodologies will then be applied to a real fighter aircraft, e.g. F/ A-18."

While substantial evidence supports computer use in education, most software used for reading provides only targeted skills practice and is ""non-instructional"". The beginning reading curricula with student assessment and monitoring mobile applications are innovative because they (a) include a complete evidence-based reading curricula that is well-aligned with research-based teaching and learning strategies and common core reading standards; (b) incorporate regular assessment to promote mastery of reading skills; (c) adapt based on student responses and assessment data to best meet students' needs; (d) include on-demand assistance to instructors to effectively implement the program; (e) provide a simple yet elegant interface that incorporates universal design features and promotes effective use of technology for teaching; and (f) remain a cost-effective alternative for efficiently teaching beginning reading skills. The broader/commercial impact of beginning reading curricula with student assessment and monitoring mobile applications is based on a demonstrated ability to change reading outcomes. Many students are at high risk for reading failure and need effective intervention in early grades. The Nation's Report Card indicates 67% of fourth graders have only partial mastery of reading skills and are struggling readers. Substantial evidence shows struggling readers are more likely to drop out before graduating, become incarcerated, and experience lifelong economic loss leading to poorer health, family, and social outcomes. Additionally, research shows that early literacy skills predict later math and science outcomes which are crucial for STEM participation. Societal implications are clear: early reading success promotes better outcomes throughout lives, while reading failure is costly to individuals and society. Yet, changing reading trajectories for struggling readers is challenging, pointing to a strong need for high-quality, intensive early reading instruction that incorporates research-based teaching and learning strategies. The beginning reading curricula with student assessment and monitoring mobile applications have clear educational and societal significance. They are cost effective, evidence-based, and provide innovative, adaptive, flexible and accessible mobile applications that parents and school staff can use to efficiently teach early reading skills."
Academic Success For All Learners,SBIR Phase I: RALP + SAM: Reading For All Learners + Student Assessment and Monitoring,National Science Foundation,N/A,Phase I,SBIR,1214763,1214763,2012-07-01,2012-12-31,N/A,2012,EA,2012,"$149,453.00",159364368,No,No,No,7,,131 North 1175 West #5,,Logan,UT,84321-8250,Alan Hofmeister,,(435) 755-7885,(435) 755-7885,Alan Hofmeister,,(435) 755-7885,read@iseesam.com,Stub,,,,"This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to address the educational needs of children at risk of reading failure in early grades, and specifically, to provide technology-based reading instruction, adaptive instructional strategies, ongoing curriculum-embedded assessments with graphical reporting, and instructional methods to support learning to read in early grades. Substantial evidence supports the effectiveness of the print-based Reading for All Learners Program (RALP) and its precursor, the SWRL little books, as summarized in the proposal. The tablet version of RALP will incorporate a student assessment and monitoring (SAM) system to ensure adequate reading progress, including measures of reading fluency and comprehension, and adaptive instructional recommendations based on student needs. Additionally, the project will incorporate voice recognition software to add a test of reading comprehension and to provide recorded student practice with feedback. Designed for teacher-led instruction with large or small groups, or one-on-one instruction with struggling students at school or home, RALP + SAM will provide instructional prompts for effective teaching and implementation. This Phase I project will investigate feasibility, identify needs and recommendations for a tablet-based adaptation from users of the print-based product, and test tablet-based adaptations and assessment, including voice recognition for reading comprehension assessment. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project relates to students at high risk for reading failure and the need for effective early intervention to reach grade level reading, math, and science goals. On the 2009 National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP), 67% of students performed at or below the basic level, and only 33% were proficient or advanced (NCES, 2010). According to NAEP researchers, students performing at or below a basic level only have ?partial mastery of prerequisite knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at each grade.? Recently, Hernandez (2011) found that children who do not read proficiently by third grade are four times more likely to drop out before graduating from high school, and six times more likely to drop out of they have not mastered even basic reading skills. This project develops a cross-platform tablet-based reading curriculum program to assist teachers and caregivers with delivery of effective instruction. This project will build upon the RALP K-3 curriculum. By integrating effective reading intervention with tablet-based computers, the reading program will have streamlined data collection, enhanced data-driven decision making, tablet-based assessment and reporting, and improved learner outcomes through adaptive instruction based on individual learner needs."

Hence many are actively migrating to faster 40/100 Gb/s technologies to support large scale transfers. Here the provision of advanced network testing/monitoring capabilities is vital for rapid and effective deployment of these new technologies. However, current 40/100 Gb/s testing systems feature bulky footprints and extremely high cost, and therefore pose a serious impediment for the rapid deployment and maintenance of next-generation networks. We propose to address these critical concerns by developing a compact, low-cost 40/100 Gb/s testing module that leverages commercial off-the-shelf hardware and provides full integration with existing network monitoring software. This solution will allow operators to greatly-increase their testing footprints and accelerate migration to faster link rates. It will also provide users with detailed real-time monitoring/diagnostic capabilities for their end-to-end data transfersa major improvement over current technologies. In the Phase I effort we conducted a thorough analysis to determine the feasibility of the planned approach. This work consisted of three primary objectives: 1) clearly defining the system requirements; 2) producing a comprehensive architecture design with full module specifications; and 3) developing a basic working prototype. This effort also conducted detailed investigations on integrating the proposed system with existing network monitoring frameworks used in the scientific community. In Phase II we will transition the Phase I feasibility study and preliminary hardware prototype into a complete system ready for commercialization. Here the initial baseline specification produced in Phase I will be significantly expanded with new capabilities and interfaces. Next, this framework will be integrated with higher-level monitoring systems to demonstrate comprehensive end-to-end test monitoring capabilities. Finally we will develop and analyze various testcase scenarios to demonstrate the final product and quantify its overall performance and cost-effectiveness. Overall, the envisioned solution will greatly benefit operators and users in the scientific and commercial communities via the provision of a compact, cost-effective 40/100 Gb/s network testing module that seamlessly interfaces with existing monitoring software. Hence operators will be able accelerate the deployment of their next-generation infrastructures and significantly improve user service support for massive bulk transfers."

A 100 Gb/s test bed proposed by ESNet is expected to facilitate rapid data transfer between geographically dispersed clouds allowing scientists to use available computing resources regardless of location. Several commercial network operators such as Verizon and AT&T have also expressed their interest in deploying 40/100 Gb/s infrastructure in their core networks [2]. These forces have driven several network hardware manufacturers to intensify their focus on the 40/100 Gb/s network product development. The burgeoning interest in the deployment of such infrastructure necessitates the development of test and measurement equipment capable of operating at data rates of the order of 100 Gb/s. To this effect, efforts have been undertaken by several hardware vendors such as Spirent, Agilent, and Ixia to develop equipment that can assess the limitations and robustness of 40/100 Gb/s systems. For instance, the Spirent TestCenter HyperMetrics 40/100 Gb/s Ethernet Module has been designed to validate performance and scalability at layers 1-7. Acadia proposes to develop a 100 Gb/s low-cost and compact pattern generator/comparator module that can be widely deployed to perform compliance testing on the lower layers of the network. These test modules can be retained at deployed locations to monitor physical links on-demand i.e., even after completion of initial testing and verification. The system is also envisioned to seamlessly integrate with network performance measurement software such as perfSONAR. The proposed effort will focus on the development of a highly reliable physical layer testing setup enabling both short-haul and long-haul links to be checked for jitter, noise, and bit errors. The project will utilize a high-speed Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) generating a Pseudo Random Bit Sequence (PRBS) which is transmitted to the optical physical link under test. On the receive side, the incoming data is checked for any bit-errors using a comparator operating at line rate. Initially, Acadia intends to design the system to transmit/receive unframed traffic, i.e., without a Media Access Control (MAC) block to allow testing of transparent links.

The complexity of the plug-in modules may range from simple antennas, to complete communication systems (e.g. 802.11b/g/n), depending on the availability of COTS chipsets/hardware. The interface specifications between the plug-in modules and the reconfigurable hardware (FPGAs) will be flexible enough to support analog-rf, or digitized-data transmission, depending on the degree of signal processing in the plug-in module itself. The FPGAs will be interfaced to the host operating system through the use of high-bandwidth PCI-Express x8 interfaces, which each provide an aggregate throughput of 16 Gb/s. This hybrid architecture, benefitting from recent developments in communication interfaces, FPGA processing power, and COTS products, will be powerful, flexible, and low cost."

These compounds have good metabolic stability in human liver, suggesting oral dosing in humans is feasible. Further, their bioavailability in rats is high (gt70%) when the compounds are given sublingually. Thus we believewe have several opportunities to develop these compounds as analgesic drugs. In this U44 Translational Research grant we will develop ER agonists as clinical candidates for treating neuropathic pain. In Phase 1, we will take leads, and determine their metabolic profiles in hepatocytes, their in vivo PK characteristics, and their permeability properties across buccal, epidermal, and intestinal (Caco2) cells. The metabolism and PK studies will allow us to predict the bioavailability in humans, and feasibility of oral dosing, while the permeability studies will provide data on the feasibility of buccal/sublingual and transdermal dosing. We will also complete in vitro safety screens for genetic, cardiovascular, or drug-drug interaction liabilities in parallelto the PK studies. We will take the compound with the best overall profile and conduct preliminary in vivo rodent toxicology and cardiovascular safety studies before initiating FDA-compliant GLP studies in Phase 2 SBIR studies. Our goal is to identify 1 ER agonist that can be administered to humans orally, sublingually or transdermally and that has manageable, or ideally no toxicity, including a NOEL at plasma concentrations at least 10-fold above pharmacologically effective concentrations. In Phase 2, the lead compound will be subject to IND-enabling toxicology, cardiovascular and genetic toxicology studies to provide the necessary supporting data for an IND submission. These studies will require GMP-grade material and will include in vitro and in vivo studies for genetic toxicity (Ames assay, chromosomal aberration assay, rat micronucleus), cardiovascular toxicity (hERG channel inhibition, cardiovascular monitoring in conscious, telemetered dogs or monkeys) and repeat dose toxicity studies for 28 days inrodent and non-rodent models. We will then schedule a pre-IND meeting with FDA to discuss the overall development pathway and understand key regulatory issues that may need to be addressed during the clinical program.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acadia Pharmaceuticals is devoted to the development of novel, safe and efficacious drugs to treat neurological disorders and in this grant we propose to develop drugs targeting estrogen receptor B (ER ) to treat neuropathic pain, a serious neurological disorder that is generally not treated effectively by available medications.

Graphite demand has been increasing with adoption of technologies such as lithium-ion batteries, which contain 10 to 30 times more graphite than lithium. A synthetic route for graphite production utilizing CO2 can help break Americaâs dependence on foreign graphite sources while decreasing CO2 emissions and increasing energy security for the United States. Both the Nationâs graphite supply and utilization of CO2 are of concern to the Department of Energy, and the DOE carbon utilization R&D effort is focused on development of technologies to transform CO2 into value-added products efficiently, economically, and in an environmentally-friendly manner. As such, production of graphite utilizing CO2 as the feedstock is a win-win, and is consistent with the mission of the Office of Fossil Energy. CO2 is a particularly attractive carbon source for graphite production due to its abundance as well as the negative effects tied to atmospheric CO2 release. While current technology can convert CO2 to carbon products, the process is costly and requires very high energy input. Development of a cost-effective and energy-efficient catalytic process to reduce CO2 to synthetic graphite would not only decrease carbon emissions and energy usage, but would be a game-changing opportunity to produce critical graphite from an abundant resource. The proposed catalyst is composed of metal particles supported on nanofibers, which protects against particle agglomeration, and has surface chemistry that resists coking. Both of these characteristics translate to higher catalyst stability and allow for operation of a multi-stage reactor system to produce graphite on a variety of substrates. To produce the catalyst monolith, an in- house, custom-built 3D printer extruder will be utilized. Phase I of this project will first demonstrate successful synthesis of the catalyst. This will be followed by testing to characterize the catalyst and to quantify its performance at small-scale to validate concept feasibility. Finally, testing of the catalyst in the multi-stage reactor will be used to demonstrate graphite production performance and catalyst stability. In 2018, the U.S. consumed over 36,000 metric tons of natural graphite valued at an estimated $37 million. As the market for electric vehicles (EV) increases, the demand for graphite will also increase due to the high percentage of graphite in lithium-ion batteries used in EVs. Total EV or hybrid vehicle registrations are expected to increase from 2.4 million units in 2020 to 10.4 million units in 2030. Overall, the lithium-ion battery market is forecasted to grow from 145 GWh in 2020 to 385 GWh by 2030. This market alone offers great commercialization potential for graphite production, but other existing and developing markets offer a diverse customer base. In addition, the production of lower-cost and/or higher-quality graphite likely translates to adoption in new sectors such as high-technology, composite materials, construction, and lubricants. Utilizing CO2 as a feedstock for synthesis of graphite benefits the public by avoiding CO2 release to the atmosphere and by securing Americaâs graphite supply."

There is, however, growing concern over the CO2 emissions resulting from fossil fuel utilization. In 2017, the U.S. alone released approximately 5.7 billion metric tons of CO2. Capture of CO2 is of concern to the Department of Energy, and the DOE Carbon Capture Program is focused on development of technologies to reduce the impact of CO2 capture on power, to scale-up for deployment at facilities, and to improve cost effectiveness of CO2 capture. To support this DOE effort, this project will develop a robust, high-capacity solid sorbent for CO2 capture. Development of this technology will support the continued safe use of coal and gas for utility and industrial applications. Current carbon capture technology using aqueous amine scrubbing has drawbacks such as cost, low capacity, degradation during cycling applications, and its corrosive nature. These issues must be addressed to ensure the feasibility of carbon capture and continued use of fossil fuel for energy generation. A potential solution to these issues is the use of high-capacity solid sorbents such as metal organic frameworks (MOF), which have very high capacity for CO2 but are often sensitive to various conditions. For practical application, the next generation of MOF sorbents need to be more robust to handle the mechanical demands and humidity associated with real-world use. The sorbents proposed in this project are amine-functionalized MOFs with 3D-printed silica scaffolding that addresses both mechanical stability and moisture tolerance. These solid sorbents are not corrosive and have greater capacity than aqueous amines. When used in a cyclical process, the sorbents can release captured CO2 as a high-purity CO2 stream for utilization in other applications. This can include manufacture of chemicals and materials from methanol to carbon nanotubes, as well as enhanced oil recovery. Phase I of this project will first demonstrate successful production of the 3D printed scaffold and in situ synthesis of the advanced sorbent. This will be followed by testing to quantify the sorbent performance at small-scale. Finally, cyclical testing will be performed under dry and humid conditions to quantify CO2 capture and recovery, and demonstrate performance capable of meeting the target of $30/metric ton of CO2 captured and 95% purity desorption production, as stated by the subtopic 20b of this FOA. The Global CO2 Initiative examined the potential market for CO2-derived products, which included five major product categories: aggregates, fuels, concrete, methanol, and polymers. These five products have the potential to create a market of over $800 billion by 2030. Tax incentives for CO2 capture and utilization make the prospect even more attractive. Currently, the 45Q tax credit offers ~$19 per metric ton of CO2 captured and utilized, and this will increase to $35 per metric ton by 2027. While fossil fuel use will remain prevalent for the foreseeable future, carbon-capture technologies can be used to offset emissions from fossil fuel sources. This benefits the public through continued, reliable power but at a decreased environmental cost while the next generation of energy technologies are developed."

Anti-angiogenic therapy represents an exciting advance in the management of cancer. Targeting of the vasculature has been shown to benefit patients with several types of malignancies. Hundreds of molecules with anti-angiogenic activity in preclinical models have been reported, and many of them have entered clinical testing in oncology. It is predicted that Avastin will be the top one drug in 2014 with a projected 8.9 billion in sales. Although many patients benefit from anti-angiogenic therapies, it is often by achieving stability of their disease and only half of patients are benefit from Avastin therapy due to lack of response to the treatment. Furthermore, there is no Avastin-response specific biomarker-based technologies to monitor anti-angiogenic therapies in the product development pipeline. Thus, development of noninvasive biomarkers of disease response and relapse is a crucial objective to aid in the management of patients. Rapid assessment of cancer response to a therapeutic regimen can determine efficacy early in the course of treatment. Early evaluation of cancer response to a therapeutic regimen can help adjust the efficacious treatment scheme, terminate ineffective treatments, minimizing unnecessary toxicity and expenditure. Recently, we applied phage display strategy and identified peptides that can selectively bind to tumors that respond to anti-angiogenic therapies. We identified a 12-mer peptide from phage display library that binds specifically to anti-angiogenic drug Avastin responsive tumors but not non-responsive or untreated tumors.This peptide was termed as Avastin- responsive peptide (AVRP). In this Phase I SBIR proposal, we will extend these efforts and further explore and develop clinically relevant AVRP specific probes for PET imaging monitoring tumor early response and efficacy to anti-tumor angiogenesis treatments. We will evaluate the ability of AVRP peptide to quantitatively measure tumor response to Avastin treatment in various tumor types and treatment regimens. We will also study the mechanism of AVRP action by identifying the target protein(s) of AVRP. Furthermore we will test a number of other therapies to determine whether suitably labeled AVRP peptide can be used as a universal probe to image cancer treatment efficacy in general. We will commercialize the product afterwe accomplish the SBIR project. The innovation in this proposal is to explore a novel strategy for developing efficient targeted imaging probes for monitoring tumor early response and efficacy to anti-angiogenic treatment. The success of this proposal will provide exciting promise to accelerate and reduce the cost of drug development, stratify patient populations, assess the treatment efficacy, and minimize the duration of treatment with ineffective regimens in cancer patients.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop the clinically translatable novel molecular imaging probes for monitoring tumor early response and efficacy to anti-angiogenic treatment regimens. Rapid assessment of cancer response to a therapeutic regimen can determine efficacy earlyin the course of treatment. We anticipate that the new tracers will provide early evaluation of cancer response to a therapeutic regimen that can help accelerate the drug development, adjust the efficacious treatment scheme, reduce the healthcare cost, eventually leading to personalized cancer therapy, treatment monitoring, and dose optimization."

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer for men worldwide. Currently, early stage prostate cancer is treated with surgery, external beam radiation or radioactive seed implants. Hormonal therapy, chemotherapy and radiation are used for the treatment of advanced disease. However, no effective treatment is available for androgen independent (AI) prostate cancers. Conventional chemotherapy is often associated with substantial toxicity, which limits its use in prostate cancer treatment. Consequently, the therapy of late-stage prostate cancer remains a challenge, and new treatment approaches are needed. Therefore, to overcome those limitations in the treatment of prostate cancer, we developed a strategy intended to selectively kill prostate cancer cells using traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutics. We hypothesize here that a targeted chemotherapeutic prodrug derived from a BBN-RGD heterodimer can selectively and effectively deliver the cytotoxic agent with a PSA Specific Peptide(PSASP) linker to prostate cancer cells, upon cleavage of the linker, the cytotoxic agent can then be released and kill the cancer cells specifically. Thus, the new prodrug is expected to have high targeting specificity for prostate cancer thus resulting in better efficacy and lower general toxicity compared with conventional chemotherapy. The first six month phase I of this proposal will focus on developing and synthesizing the prodrugs and in vitro characterization for their receptor binding affinity, hydrophilicity and cytotoxicity. The second phase of the proposal will focus on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of DOX-PSASP- BBN-RGD prodrugs. We will carry out clinical monitoring systems using molecular imaging for treatment efficient study. We will obtain GMP quality DOX-PSASP-BBN-RGD conjugate. We will generate and compile sufficient data and reports for preclinical safety assessment of DOX-PSASP-BBN-RGD. The innovation in this proposal is developing a novel strategy which provides exciting promise to develop efficient targeted chemotherapy products that can be applied to various types of cancers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop the novel prodrugs: DOX-PSASP-BBN-RGD for the targeted chemotherapy of prostate cancer. The new prodrugs have a highly potent cytotoxic agent, a heterodimer of two peptides specific for prostate cancer receptors and different cleavable linkers for targeted chemotherapy of prostate cancers. Because the prodrugs targets preferentially to specific receptors on cancer cells, we anticipated that the new prodrugs will have better efficacy and reduced peripheral toxicity. The same strategy should also be applicable to other cancer therapeutics."

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer affecting men in the United States. Currently, early stage prostate cancer is treated with surgery, external beam radiation or radioactive seed implants. Hormonal therapy, chemotherapy and radiation are used for the treatment of advanced disease. However, no effective treatment is available for androgen independent prostate cancers. Significant effort has been expanded in attempts to develop radiolabeled antibodies for therapeutics purposes. Clinical applications of these radiolabeled macromolecules have generally been unsatisfactory due to low tumor specificity of targeted epitopes, limited penetration into tumors, and the provocation of anti-mouse immunoglobulin responses. These considerations favor the use of nonimmunogenic small molecules with higher uptake in tumors. These criteria are fulfilled by peptides. Some peptides such as gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) and its receptor has been found highly expressed in tumor cells, including prostate, breast, gut and pancreas. Recently, bombesin (BBN) peptide derivatives have been labeled with 177Lu and 90Y for prostate cancer therapy with promise. Despite the success of such approaches, these peptide tracers have relatively low tumor uptake and retention in prostate cancer and suboptimal in vivo kinetics. We recently developed the concept of dual receptor targeting. We designed a BBN-RGD peptide heterodimer that binds to both GRPR and integrin ?v?3, which showed outstanding tumor targeting efficacy and imaging characteristics. Dual-receptor binding results in more than an additive effect in vivo in terms of tumor uptake and retention in an androgen-receptor (AR)-negative PC-3 tumor model. Therefore, in this SBIR proposal, we would like to extend this concept to develop a clinically translatable peptide receptor targeted radiotherapy (PRTR). The first six- month phase I of this proposal will focus on developing and synthesizing the peptide radiotracers and in vitro characterization for their receptor binding affinity, hydrophilicity and cytotoxicity. The second phase of the proposal will focus on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the radiotracers. Mouse dosimetry of therapeutic 90Y-labeled BBN-RGD peptides will be calculated. The maximum tolerable dose (MTD) for 90Y- labeled BBN-RGD radiopharmaceuticals will be determined by dose escalation studies. Treatment efficacy on different tumor models will be assessed. The innovation in this proposal is developing a novel strategy which provides exciting promise to develop efficient targeted radiotherapy products that can be applied to various types of cancers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop the novel clinically translatable dual integrin and GRPR targeted radiotherapy of prostate cancer.

The cost of chemical and enzymatic synthesis of many RNA or modified RNA aptamers remains prohibitive for their development as therapeutics, which limit their application in diagnostic and biosensor applications. The cheapest and best alternative method is to synthesize short DNA aptamers. Unfortunately, short DNA aptamers frequently do not bind their targets with high affinities and specificities, because the surface area between the aptamer and target is too small to ensure multiple contacts. We propose a novel selection method that will both generate high affinity aptamers in a single step and significantly reduce the cost of synthesis of these aptamers. Deliverables for this project will be short aptamers that can bind as networks to MS2 bacteriophage or B. subtilis with affinities in the nanomolar range. The specificities of these aptamer networks will be measured by determining whether they bind to non-cognate targets."

To overcome these methodological limitations, we propose to increase the final amplified RNA yield by 1) improving the efficiency of T7 RNA polymerase using structure-based engineering with directed evolution of function, 2) by optimizing the design of the promoter-template construct for specific amplification needs and 3) by re-standardization of cDNA synthesis for lower RNA inputs. The combined improvements are expected to lower the cell-limited RNA sample requirement by 100-fold compared to current, commercially available kits. This will enable microarray gene analysis with as little as 1 ng of total RNA with a single round of amplification or microarray profiling from a single cell (-10 pg of total RNA) after two rounds of amplification."

Accacia International proposes to design and prototype a compact, handheld fluorescence polarization based sensor capable of detecting biowarfare agents. Accacia International, with the aid of Dr. Andrew EllingtonÂ¿s laboratory, will develop assays for a variety of biothreat agents and a device that can detect a signal created by the transduction of high-affinity peptide binding into fluorescently labeled nucleic acid signal. Multiple peptide ligands selected for by peptide phage display will be immobilized on phycoerythrin (PE) in order to create multivalent conjugates that can bind with high affinity for the surfaces of biothreat agents including Bacillus anthracis and Escherichia coli. These multivalent conjugates, so-called Â¿burrsÂ¿, will also contain nucleic acid tags that can be amplified by rolling circle amplification (RCA). Peptide-mediated RCA will be detected by observing the substantive changes in fluorescence polarization (FP) that will result from the incorporation of fluorescent nucleotides into long, concatameric polymers. The assays will be optimized and adapted to a MEMS-FP device designed by Accacia International. Anticipated Benefits / Potential Commercial Applications of the Reasearch and Development: There is a great demand for ultrasensitive assays and instrumentation in the clinical diagnostic, water monitoring, agricultural and food industries. The Accacia Team will couple proximity ligation with the ultrasensitivity and speed of a fluorescence sensor by incorporating Â¿burrsÂ¿ into fluorescence polarization assays adapted to a MEMS-FP device to be used initially by the Homeland Defense and adapted for commercial use in detection of foodborne pathogens and marketed to food and agricultural industries."

AccaciaÂ¿s scientists have provided consulting services and performed research work on SBIR projects in collaboration with other awardees, also developed products for commercial use. Accacia has also teamed up with the Ellington Labs at the University of Texas at Austin, to perform research work in the field of aptamer development. Accacia has to its credit several achievements. Although unrelated to this proposal since its inception in 2000, Accacia Inc. has developed and prototyped a reflectance IC Strip reader for the medical diagnostic industry. Patents are pending for the same. Additional patents are in process for two other technologies. Accacia undertakes OEM manufacturing of immunochromatographic strips for various diagnostic serum assays. Antibodies are often modified and conjugated for use in detection of biowarfare agents, foodborne pathogens, and for use in clinical diagnostics. Nucleic acids (aptamers) specifically selected to bind to targets of interest, have been demonstrated as potential replacement for antibodies due to their high specificity, accelerated development time, and low cost of production. Developments of aptamers to certain targets like Bacillus Anthracis (BA) whole spores also pose their own set of challenges. The chemistries available to aptamers are relatively limited and to some extent impede their ability to recognize an even wider variety of targets. For example, aptamers are by and large polyanions, and thus may have difficulty recognizing targets that are negatively charged. In order to expand the range of nucleic acid chemistry while still maintaining the inherent advantages of nucleic acid biosensors relative to antibodies, Accacia proposes to develop both covalent and non-covalent nucleic acid:peptide conjugates and to utilize these conjugates in novel signal transduction schemes. All of the molecular regents developed during Phase I will be adapted during Phase II for use with the IGEN ORIGEN analyzer. This analytical platform has been chosen for three reasons. First, electrochemical luminescence (ECL) provides extremely sensitive levels of detection when compared with traditional fluorescence detection systems. Second, ORIGEN technology is either currently being used, or soon to be employed by a number of government programs including the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMARID), the Department of DefenseÂ¿s Automated Biological Agent Testing System program (ABATS), the Department of Defense for the Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) and the Department of Defense U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command. Third, there are numerous antibody assays on the ORIGEN which can be directly compared with the novel reagents we are generating, as per the requirements set out for the SBIR."

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the increasing need of serological testing we propose the
development and clinical validation of a novel serological blood test, RapidQCTâ¢, to aid in the
diagnosis and management of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the case for other viral infections, the
immune system responds to the COVID-19 infection by developing antibodies (IgG and IgM, among
others) against the virus (SARS-COV-2). Antibody titer tests have been a valuable tool to determined
individual immunity to several infection diseases, from rubella, to measles. More importantly, as
COVID-19 vaccines become available, and a large-scale vaccination strategy will take place, the
RapidQCT will help stratify potentially hundred of millions of people and identify who is most likely to
benefit, and sparing those who will not. Because the test can be self-administered by patients, it will
also promote mobile health management of the pandemic, expanding the breadth of testing, and
protecting health care workers from exposure. Current serological tests are binary test, which only
provide a yes/no answer, and therefore unable to provide a full picture of the development the
immunity across the population. On the other hand, the RapidQCT is an easy to use and rapid test
and the first quantitative Point-of-Care (POC) anti-COVID-19 antibody titer test. The size of credit
card, it requires only one drop of blood from finger prick to asses the presence and titer level of anti-
COVID-19 antibodies. The test companion mobile app enables the tracking of the disease spreading,
progression, as well as development of the immunity throughout the population. This project will be
completed in two Phases: Phase I - Aim 1: Fabrication Streamline, Scale-Up, and Assay
Calibration. In this Aim, we will translate from the current lean development phase to the
manufacturing phase. Phase I - Aim 2: Assay Calibration: Here we will determined the assay titer
curve calibration. Phase II - Aim 1: Longitudinal monitoring of COVID-19 specific antibody titers.
The RapidQCT tests will use to follow longitudinally to three groups: Symptomatic Infected (SI),
Asymptomatic Infected (AI), and Not Infected (NI) (control). The trend of the antibody titer for each
group will be stratified by gender, age, pre-conditions, and severity of infection. Phase II - Aim 2:
Longitudinal monitoring of antibody titers in pregnancy. Immunological changes occurring in
COVID-19 positive pregnancy versus the non-pregnant population will be monitored.
This project is the result of an ongoing collaboration between Accel Diagnostics and The University of
Texas Health Science Center at Houston (Houston, TX), and it is expected to deliver a clinically
validated and novel tool to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.Narrative
Responding to the COVID-19 emergency, Accel Diagnostics is developing an inexpensive, easy to use, rapid,
and quantitative anti-COVID-19 antibody test, RapidQCTâ¢ - The first fully disposable quantitative blood test,
the size of credit card, which require only one drop of blood from finger prick to quantify the COVID-19
antibody titer (concentration), and help monitoring the spreading of the disease and the individual and herd
immunity."

According to the CDC, in the U.S. over 2.8M emergency department visits are associated with
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) each year, and over 288,000 result in patientsandapos; hospitalization. TBI
ranges in degree, with over 75% of these injuries classified as âmildâ TBI (mTBI), also referred to
as concussions. The clinical diagnosis of TBI and its severity remains challenging. Physicians
often resort to Computed Tomography (CT) scans to detect brain tissue damage or intracranial
lesions, and diagnose TBI. However, the majority of these scans are negative, as mTBI rarely
results in detectable lesions. As such, of the 1.5 million head CT scans performed every year on
possible TBI patients, as many as 80% are unnecessary. CT scans carry significant radiation
exposure, increasing the risk of radiation-induced cancer and economic burden. The prompt and
accurate triage of patients that should or should not receive a CT scan remains a major medical
challenge.
This SBIR Phase I proposal aims to develop and validate a point-of-care blood based diagnostic
device for triaging and managing patients presenting with head injury. The device, the pScreen-
TBI, leverages Accel Diagnosticsandapos; innovative and patented detection technology to accurately
quantify the level of two key biomarkers, known as UCH-L1 and GFAP. The use of these
biomarkers were recently cleared by the FDA to aid the evaluation of which patients affected by
head injuries should be CT scanned. The FDA decision is supported by numerous studies that
showed that elevated levels of these biomarkers have 99.7% sensitivity in determining which
patients have lesions visible on a CT scans and those which not with a 99.6% NPV (negative
predictive value). The pScreen-TBI incorporates, for the first time, the predictive power of these
biomarkers in a disposable, easy to use, and economic tool that delivers a rapid and sensitive
readout in an emergency and Point-of-Care setting. The device has clear utility for athletic and
battlefield injuries and motor vehicle accidents. First responders can use the device to make
decisions on patient need to be CT scanned, routing critical information to clinicians while en
route to the hospital via the connected smart-phone application.
Phase I efforts will focus on developing, optimizing, and validating a functional prototype for the
parallel quantification of UCH-L1 and GFAP from a single finger-stick blood sample. Specifically,
we will completed two Specific Aims: Aim 1) design and fabricate the dual-plex platform, select
the optimal pair of capture and detection antibodies, and optimize reaction components for each
biomarker; and Aim 2) conduct a comparative pre-clinical validation study against a gold-
standard, high-sensitivity lab-assay (ELISA) using human blood samples.
The proposed project is supported by extensive preliminary data, and a multi-disciplinary team
bringing industry and academia together, and including a biochemist, a physicist, two assay
development scientist, a neurosurgeon, a TBI biomarker discovery expert, a neuroscientist, and
the support of two of the Nationandapos;s leading TBI experts, Dr. B. Omalu (inspiration for the movie
Concussion), and Dr. J. Maroon (team neurosurgeon of the Pittsburgh Steelers).
In summary this Phase I addresses an unmet clinical need with significant commercial
opportunity. The successful development of this technology could minimize diagnostic uncertainty
and eliminating unnecessary procedures, leading directly to better overall health outcomes and
reduce costs.Project Narrative
Accel Diagnostics is proposing the development of an innovative blood diagnostic test to aid the
triage of patients presenting with head injury. Accel Diagnosticsandapos; technology could transform how
such injuries are handled in an emergency setting, resulting in significantly improved short- and long-
term health outcomes. Furthermore, this easy use, rapid, and affordable device would eliminate
millions of unnecessary Computed Tomography (CT) scans, reducing the risk of radiation-induced
cancers for million of patients and saving hundred of millions of dollars each year in avoidable
medical expenses.

THIS TEXT HAS NOT BEEN PROOFED BY SRA. WHEN THE UPLOADED ABSTRACT IS NOT IN THE EXPECTED FORMAT, THE EXTRACTED TEXT MAY BE INCORRECT OR INCOMPLETE.**** Project Summary: The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop a novel blood filtration system, mPharesis , for the treatment of severe malaria patients. The World Health Organization estimates that each year approximately 300 million malaria episodes occur globally resulting in nearly one million deaths, 85% of which are children. The majority of deaths are caused by severe malaria. Severe malaria is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is responsible for more than 200,000 cases of fetal loss and more than 10,000 maternal deaths annually. Severe malaria also occurs in 5% of the nearly 30,000 imported malaria cases by travelers from endemic areas. Even when managed aggressively with intravenous antimalarial drugs (artesunate or quinine) mortality rates range between 10%-22%, and as high as 40% for the most complicated cases. Blood exchange transfusion (ET) and erythropheresis (EP) have been effectively used to significantly accelerate the clearance of malaria infected red blood cells from circulation. A large body of medical studies has shown that these treatments if available are beneficial. However, the current systems used to perform these therapies are not engineered to selectively separatethe infected cells from the non infected. Thus, to remove these toxic infected cells the entire patient's blood is disposed - wasting in most cases between to 70%-95% of the healthy blood. This inefficacy results in larger than needed consumption of donorblood. Consequently, ET and EP therapies remain a prerogative of industrialized nations. This is precisely the motivation for developing the proposed mPharesis  system - a system that will allow the removal of toxic infected red blood cells from the patient's blood circulation with minimal or no use of donor blood. The mPharesis  filter operates by targeting these cells' unique (and well-known) magnetic properties. This system represents the first medical device of its kind to employ magnetic separation technology to clear these toxic cells from circulation. In this SBIR Phase 1 effort, we will complete the design verification of a first-generation mPharesis . This objective will be accomplished by entailing experimentation and numerical simulation, to achieve a prototype optimized for high-throughput, high separation efficiency, and low residual parasitic load. In specific, the successful completion of this Phase 1, will yield a working prototype, suitable for animal testing (in Phase 2), capable of reducing parasitic load (up to 40%) to less than 1.0% within a time period of 2-3 hours, and demonstrating satisfactory hemocompatibility. mPharesis  is intended for those millions of children and adults who have already reached the severe malaria stage, and will provide a life-saving measure for cases that do not respond well to conventional treatments - as too often occurs in the advanced severe stages of this deadly disease. Project Narrative (NIH SBIR Phase-I, December 5th 2011 Application) Application Title: Blood Filtration System for the Treatment of Severe Malaria Patients Tropical Health Systems, LLC Contact PI: Alberto Gandini, Ph.D., MBA Consortium PI: James Antaki, Ph.D. Tropical Health Systems is developing a novel blood filtration system, mPharesis , for the treatment of severe malaria. Severe malaria is a life-threatening condition causing the vast majority of the nearly one million malaria fatalities each year. mPharesis  technology would allow the removal of malaria infected red blood cells from the patient's blood safely, effectively, and swiftly. mPharesis  will significantly reduce the consumption of donor blood by up to 95% compared to current blood treatment technologies, thus reducing the treatment cost and increasing access to treatmentto millions of people. mPharesis  will provide a life-saving treatment to those millions of children and adults who have reached the severe malaria stage, and do not respond well to conventional treatment - as too often occurs with this deadly disease."

Indeed, system reliability concerns are imperative to future military sensor, electronic warfare, and communication systems. In essence there remains one primary and significant issue that limits the widespread implementation of RF reliability assessment on a large scale. The issue is cost. One way to reduce cost is to integrate functions in fewer boxes or packages. Possible implementation architectures would most probably combine a system in-a-package (SIP) mother-board with a group of system-on-chip (SOC) monolithic building blocks specific to frequency, power level, and DC bias/sensing requirements. By segmenting circuit functions by semiconductor technology-attributes it is possible to create universal""building-block""monolithic devices.This Phase I effort will focus on implementing a universal reliability system configuration that has a goal of significantly reducing the cost per site of RF accelerated life test systems.

In healthy children and adults, fractures normally heal without sequelae, though the temporary disability can lead to muscle atrophy, rehabilitation, and lost time from the work place. Advancing age and other co-morbid conditions, such as diabetes, can greatly increase fracture healing times and reduce overall rates for successful healing. In addition, severe muscle atrophy and prolonged stays at hospitals and rehabilitation or nursing homes are especially common in elderly and diabetic patients. A 25% reduction in healing time would reduce complications and enable people to return to their normal routines much sooner, while dramatically reducing costs associated with healing. Thus a therapy that would accelerate the normal healing process would be of significant benefit to many of the 10 million Americans who suffer a fracture each year. Presently, no such therapy exists. We previously demonstrated that loss or inhibition of COX-2 severely impairs fracture healing. Our tests to understand the mechanism of this impairment led us to test the effects of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) inhibitors on the rate of fracture healing. This was based on the idea that when COX-2 is inhibited, arachidonic acid is shunted into the 5-LO pathway and the resulting metabolites slow fracture healing, as detailed in the Background section of this proposal. Following this idea, we have identified a 5-LO inhibitor (A-79175) that reduces the time for fracture healing in rats by 25%, reduced non-unions to 0% from 33% at the experimental endpoint, and increased measures of healed bone strength by 50-90% compared to untreated controls. We have developed a use patent estate for this compound and 5-LO inhibitors in general for bone healing. The composition of matter patent on this compound has lapsed so we can use this compound without having to obtain a license. This compound is a small molecule and is orally available. A-79175 has already successfully passed Phase I human clinical trials for asthma. The half life and other drug-like properties of this molecule, including potency, are well suited for the indication of treating fractures. The aim of this proposal is to demonstrate that A-79175 will accelerate and enhance fracture healing in a higher animal model. A positive finding in this animal model will support the use of 5-LO inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for fracture care, position A-79175 for an IND application for proof of concept testing in humans, and move our company toward further successful development of the first drug to enhance the rate of bone healing. Increasing the rate of healing could have a large impact on those with factures by improving patient quality of life, reducing recuperation time, muscle wasting, rehabilitation time, incidence of complications, overall health care costs, and more.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative We have identified an orally delivered drug that accelerates and enhances fracture healing in small animal models. Bone fractures are common traumatic injuries. Complications associated with fractures include delayed healing or failed healing (non-unions) and attending disability and muscle atrophy. Common pathological conditions such as osteoporosis and diabetes increase the incidence of fractures or significantly impair healing. Presently, there is no cost-effective therapy to prospectively treat fractures to reduce time to healing or reduce the incidence of delayed healing or non-union. This project will test our newly identified therapy in a clinically relevant animal model to confirm our previous findings and justify testing in humans."

This is achieved through development of technology designed to lower the cost of wind turbine drive trains and associated power electronics, high cost items which are often left without innovation in new wind turbine designs. Prohibitively high costs are currently the biggest barrier to widespread adoption of distributed wind turbines, and power electronics can be as much as 50% of these costs. Significant cost reduction has the potential to increase worldwide distributed wind power adoption. The innovative power train technology developed in this project is specifically designed to couple with a proprietary technology for wind capture at rooftop edges. When combined with this technology, costs estimates are competitive with rooftop solar energy, enabling wind energy to become a common addition to rooftop solar installations. Successful deployment of this technology will contribute to society by decreasing the carbon footprint of energy production, increasing energy resiliency, and creating new jobs associated with manufacturing and deployment. Significant manufacturing efforts are likely to remain in the US, creating local job opportunities and economic growth. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to use a novel drive train architecture to reduce small wind turbine power train costs. In this architecture, costs are lowered by temporarily storing the energy coming out of the wind turbine rotor in a flywheel before passing it on to the generator. This allows for the power train to include a generator and inverter that are sized for average rather than peak power outputs, enables removal of diversion load, and allows for the use of a faster spinning, and therefore lower cost generator. The Phase I project seeks to prove the feasibility of developing a low-cost flywheel which meets the needs of the overall drive train (including efficiency and reliability), a powertrain control system which maintains high efficiency, and a powertrain system configuration which maintains the reduced cost projections required for market traction. Research efforts include development of a bench-scale drive train to test the controls of the flywheel, powertrain simulation to test alternative generator and converter topologies, and benchmarking of generator candidates to determine efficiency and power density.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has recommended thatmajor wheat yield improvements must play a key role to ensure future global food security.Experts agree the most promising way to improve wheat yields is to capture the higher productivityand vigor associated with hybridity.Despite 60+ years of effort by the seed industry to develophybrid wheat as a commercial product all the U.S. wheat acreage is still planted to self-pollinatedvarieties. Failure to ensure timely and intended cross-pollinations renders production of hybridÂ®
wheat seed extremely inefficient and cost prohibitive. Our PowerPollen technology to preserveÂ®
and apply viable pollen on-demand is changing this paradigm.Developing a PowerPollen systemfor wheat presents significant technical challenges due to the short life of pollen and feasibility ofcollecting sufficient pollen for on-demand pollinations. We are seeking to overcome theselimitations by developing novel technologies to extract large volumes of highly viable pollendirectly from anthers collected from excised wheat spikes. The goal of this Phase I SBIR projectis to prove the feasibility of developing a scalable technology for collecting large volumes of viablewheat pollen.This engineering achievement is essential to enable on-demand pollination andrevolutionize hybrid wheat seed production.The research objectives are: (1) Prove the feasibilityof designing/constructing a scalable method for mechanically harvesting male wheat spikescontaining mature viable pollen (2) Construct a scalable prototype to validate the concept ofseparating anthers containing viable pollen from green plant material and (3) Develop and provean efficient method of liberating viable pollen grains from intact wheat anthers for subsequentconditioning and storage.Anticipated Results and Potential Commercial Applications:Â®
Our preliminary data show that PowerPollen technology extends the viability of wheat pollendramatically.Pollen with the highest viability resides in anthers which can be isolated from theflowers mechanically.We anticipate the novel methods being evaluated in this Phase I projectwill provide sufficient volumes of viable wheat pollen to enable bulk storage and field-scaleevaluation of on-demand applications in Phase II.We have existing relationships with major seedÂ®companies and have demonstrated the value of PowerPollen in maize under commercial fieldconditions.Our communications with leadership in the hybrid wheat industry and wheat breedersconfirm that current hybrid wheat production systems result in only about 40 to 50% seed set dueto inadequate pollinations.The cost to produce hybrid seed using cytoplasmic male sterility isabout $1000 per hectare; the cost is more than double that value using gametocide to inducesterility.A productive female inbred allowed to self-pollinate can produce 6 tons/hectare.If sowell-managed hybrid system requiring 35% male inbred achieving 50% seed set would yield aboutÂ®
2 tons per hectare under favorable conditions. Assuming conservatively that a PowerPollenapplication can result in 75% seed set this would result in a 50% increase in hybrid seed yield toÂ®
3 tons per hectare.At a COGS for hybrid wheat seed of $500/ton the value add for PowerPollenin this scenario is about $500 per hectare.A licensing/royalty fee that captures 25% of this valuewould equate to $125 of revenue per hectare.The value add would be more than double forgametocide-based systems and if the area allocated to male inbreds could be decreased.

Network planners have few free tools to help them balance the many variables in potential network expansions (including cost, performance, and energy usage), and few free tools to communicate these plans with managers and other stakeholders. Most free network monitoring tools operate on a fairly low level, and require complex configuration. Network operators have limited economical options for generating high-level graphical views of their networks based on this low-level data. The Holistic Operations Planning System (HOPS) is an open-source tool that integrates with the existing low-level tools to create high-level reports and support new planning tools. Acceleration will use its own nationwide network infrastructure and clients as a test bed for data gathering from low-level tools, specifically Nagios (<a href=""https://www.nagios.org"">https://www.nagios.org</a>) and Cacti (<a href=""http://www.cacti.net/"">http://www.cacti.net/</a>). The system included automation and step-by-step instructions for confiruing these lower-level network tools. The planning system allows multiple potential network expansions, with capacity estimates based on low-level data. HOPS produces side-by-side comparisons of these plans to summarize the options for managers and decision makers. Commercial Application and Other Benefits: Network plans developed in HOPS may be shared between organizations, allowing different operators to learn from each others experience. High-level historical data about a network informs network consolidations when organizations merge, letting operators make better decisions on how to combine two different networks. The planning tools enable network operators to easily evaluate and rank their options and ultimately create faster, cheaper networks to support the growing bandwidth needs of consumers."

There is a critical unmet medical need for a rapid accurate test to identify AML patients who are likely to respond
to chemotherapy  Presently  induction chemotherapy with the DNA damaging drugs cytarabine  ARA C  and
idarubicin IDR  known as is the standard of care for most of these patients However is a relatively
ineffective therapy particularly in older patients and has serious therapy related toxicities Accelerated Medical
Diagnostics is developing the InductDx test to identify those patients whose AML will respond to induction
chemotherapy The test utilizes ex vivo andquot diagnostic microdosesandquot  of the therapeutic dose of  C labeled
ARA C and  C labeled IDR Extremely low levels of  C label are quantified in cancer cells isolated from patient
blood samples using accelerator mass spectrometry AMS  AMS is the most sensitive technology available for
quantifying radiolabeled compounds in biological samples We hypothesize that a threshold level of drug DNA
damage is required for efficacy and the level of microdose induced drug DNA damage is predictive of the
capacity of AML cells to attain that threshold during in vivo chemotherapy  The extent of microdose induced
drug DNA damage in cell cultures and AML patient samples will be compared with cellular sensitivities and
retrospective patient response to therapy as proof of concept for clinical development of the InductDx test
for AML
 We propose to develop a rapid clinically actionable ex vivo biomarker test to predict which AML patients will
respond to cytarabine and idarubicin combination chemotherapy This platform technology will enable
improved treatment outcomes for AML and other cancers"

The project evaluates a package to train teachers to use software called the Pivotal Skills Trainer and examines whether doing so improves preschoolers&#039; functional communication skills both on- and off-computer. A major feature of the children&#039;s computer lessons is that they are linked to the best of today&#039;s evidence-based curricula and intervention practices. The children&#039;s lessons are unique because (a) they maximize motivation for learning by using high-interest videos as rewards and instructional cues, access to which may be self-determined; (b) they enhance attention to complex instructional cues by structuring interactive involvement with classes and components of cues and by encouraging fluent category learning; and (c) they foster independence and spontaneity by teaching self-initiated socialization routines for engaging others about computer lessons learned. The Specific Aims of the project seek a compelling initial demonstration of the effectiveness, efficiency, and desirability of the software product and its user training package. Aim 1 is to evaluate the teachers&#039; training and their satisfaction in using the Pivotal Skills Trainer (with pretest-posttest designs and consumer satisfaction surveys). Aim 2 is to verify that teacher&#039;s use of the Pivotal Skills Trainer improves children&#039;s skill sets (with multiple baseline and alternating treatments designs).

This STTR (Phase I) project will begin to change this state of affairs by researching and developing empirically derived multimedia teaching tools. Encouraged by early-stage feasibility work, we evaluate a package to train teachers to use PowerPoint(R) to deliver activity schedules to improve children&#039;s independent play and social skills. Our proposed use of multimedia software does what typical off-the-shelf software does not - it embeds photos, sounds, and videos to convey meaning in a context that maximizes learning among things that are heard, watched, said, and done away from the computer. The PowerPoint(R) lessons are linked to a child&#039;s individualized educational plan focusing on functional verbal skills. The independence fostered by activity schedules makes the learning outcomes remarkably different from, but complementary to, those achieved by other teaching methods. Even greater independence is achieved when a child learns to use activity schedules presenting sequences of multimedia cues for what to say and do during play. The Specific Aims of Phase I are as follows: Aim 1 verifies fidelity of each teacher&#039;s use of Notebook and PowerPoint(R) activity schedules and that a child&#039;s independent play and social initiations improve (with multiple baseline designs). Aim 2 evaluates each teacher&#039;s skill acquisition and consumer feedback resulting from how-to training in PowerPoint(R) activity schedules (with multiple baseline designs and consumer satisfaction survey).

(ATC) and the Accelerator Research Lab (ARL) at Texas A&M Univcrsity have collaboratively developed a novel conformal winding methodology that could make it possible to orient all of the REBCO in a winding in this favorable orientation, so that the quantity of expensive superconductor would be minimized. ARL has submitted a proposal to the university program of DOE-HEP to develop the Conformal Winding technology and use it to fabricate the insert windings for an 18 T hybrid dipole suitable for future hadron colliders. ATC has developed an innovative technology for a Nb3Sn outsert winding that could be assembled with ARLâs REBCO insert to make the hybrid dipole robust and cost-effective. ATC requests SBIR funding to develop its SuperCIC cable using high-performance Nb3Sn wire, and to develop flared-end windings in the geometry required for the hybrid dipole outsert. The two efforts are close companions â ARL will develop the REBCO conformal winding insert, and ATC will develop the Nb3Sn SuperCIC outsert. The two developments would proceed largely in parallel until first models of both windings have been built. The SuperCIC cable is fabricated by cabling Nb3Sn wires onto a perforated center tube, then the cable is pulled as a loose fit through a high-strength sheath tube, and the sheath is drawn onto the cable to compress the wires against the center tube and immobilize them. A robotic bend tooling has been developed that can form small-radius bends and yet preserve the interior registration of the wires without wire strain. The Nb3Sn CIC can thereby be formed into the flared-end windings needed for the outsert of the 18 T dipole. The CIC structure provides stress management at the cable level, and cryogen can be flowed through the center tube so that the outsert could be operated at 5 K (necessary for Nb3Sn) while the insert could be operated at ~20 K (without penalty using REBCO). The option to operate the insert hotter could be a major benefit in an ultimate-energy hadron collider, where synchrotron radiation will deposit large heat load near the beam tube. During the Phase 1 project ATC will develop and evaluate short flared-end windings of Nb3Sn SuperCIC and test them as inserts in BNLâs 11 T background field dipole. Following those tests, ATC will fabricate a 180 m segment of Nb3Sn SuperCIC, form it into a 4-layer flared-end outsert winding, and install it in a steel flux return. This model dipole can serve a succession of roles in follow-on projects: It can be operated at 4.2 K as a 7.5 T background field dipole (TAMU4) with 7x10 cm2 clear aperture, in either BNLâs or LBNLâs test cryostat. This would provide a first test bed for the performance of Nb3Sn SuperCIC outsert winding technology. It would be the first task of a follow-on ATC Phase 2 effort if the Phase 1 is successful. The conformal REBCO dipole insert winding could be installed in its aperture and connected in series to make an 11.3 T dipole (TAMU5), which would provide a first test bed for the conformal winding technology. This would conjoin ATCâs outsert development with ARLâs insert development, and constitute the second task in the Phase 2 effort. A second 4-layer Nb3Sn SuperCIC flared-end sub-winding can be added and connected in series with the TAMU5 winding to make the first-ever 18 T flared-end dipole. The innovations of ATCâs Nb3Sn SuperCIC outsert and ARLâs conformal REBCO insert thus have the potential to provide a robust basis to achieve many of the objectives of the Magnet Development Program. ATC has two specific product initiatives utilize the same innovations as does the solenoidal lens: a multi- zone NMR spectrometer, in which up to 10 ppb spectroscopy zones are produced in the bore of a single high-field spectrometer, and a pseudo-direct-drive generator for wind turbines, which could efficiently couple the low-rpm rotation of a blade hub to the high-rpm required for efficient electric power conversion."

The wire cost is dominated not by the Bi-2212 powder within, but by the large fraction (80% of wire cross section) that is silver! The silver fraction is driven by the limitations of the powder-in- tube process that is used today for manufacture of Bi-2212/Ag wire. ATC has pioneered a new process for wire fabrication that significantly enhances the local area ratio (LAR) of Bi-2212:Ag (and thereby the current density). ATCâs process technology builds upon recent advances in jelly- roll processing of Nb3Al in Japan, and upon ATCâs experience in forming textured-powder Bi- 2212 square rods with uniform properties, and upon ATCâs innovations for the fixturing and robotic formers for bending a heterogeneous assembly of superconducting wires while preserving its internal registration. ATC is developing a cable-in-conduit (CIC) conductor which can be made in versions using Nb3Sn and Bi-2212, which is designed for use in hybrid-coil magnets. It is expected that the jelly- roll Bi-2212/Ag wire should be well-suited for use in both Rutherford cables and CIC conductors. The process will be developed to form a channel plate in silver alloy using a 2-roll press on which the forming rollers are machined with the desired channel pattern. The channels will be filled with Bi-2212 powder in a controlled atmosphere. A cover plate will be applied, and the assembly will be compressed to seal the ribs between channels to the cover plate and to apply uniaxial compression to texture the powder cores. The sealed assembly will then be rolled transversely and sheathed to form a jelly-roll billet. The billet will be cold-extruded and then drawn to make fine-filament round wire. ATCâs jelly-roll process wouldenhancethecost- performance of Bi-2212 wire for three product applications: NMR spectroscopy for molecular medicine, direct-drive generators for wind turbines, and hybrid windings for the solenoids and toroids for fusion tokamaks. The jelly-roll process offers the promise of a path to make wire with Ag fraction ~1:1. The LAR enhancement offers two parallel benefits: reducing the cost of the wire, and increasing its performance so that the overall winding package is more compact and thereby more efficient."

ATC has successfully developed a single-layer 13 kA NbTi CIC cable, and our collaborators at Texas A&M University (TAMU) have successfully used it to make a 3 T dipole suitable for the arcs of a 100 GeV Ion Ring that has until now been the baseline design for JLEIC. The recent NAS report cautions that 200 GeV ion energy would likely be needed, however, to cover the range of energy required for the objectives of the EIC project. ATC has developed a design for a cost-effective large-aperture 6 T dipole based upon a two-layer 23 kA NbTi CIC cable that preserves the simplicity of fabrication that has been demonstrated in the 3 T model. The proposed 23 kA cable is a challenging development. The issues of the compliant interlayer and sheath compression to support stable bending the coil ends, cryogen transport, and quench protection have been studied in short cable segments. All issues appear to be compatible with the requirements for the 23 kA cable and for forming the dipole winding, but much work must be done to optimize the cable parameters and prepare and test short model windings. In the proposed Phase 1 effort ATC will develop a 2-layer cable-in-conduit conductor and the coil technology to use it to make the windings for a 6 T arc dipole. The objectives of the Phase 1 effort are to optimize the 2-layer CIC by building and evaluating medium-length samples, to develop a model of out motorized bend tooling that will form the flared U-bends for the dipole, to short-sample test 2-layer cables containing a single superconducting strand in registration with 35 bronze strands, and to fabricate a first 3-turn winding in the geometry for the 6-T dipole winding. Pending success in those objectives, a follow-on Phase 2 effort would make modifications arising from what we learn and then build and test a first 6 T 1.2 m model dipole. The proposed CIC dipole development offers a cost-effective path to establish a credible basis for a 200 GeV re-embodiment of the JLEIC design. It uses half the superconductor and 1/3 the number of turns that was required in a recent prototype cos ï± dipole developed by IHEP and GSI that has the same field strength and aperture. As such it directly addresses the primary challenge to the JLEIC design that was expressed in the NAS report. The 2-layer cable has several potential commercial applications, for which ATC has developed a preliminary Business Plan: (1) 40 kA CIC using Nb3Sn for compact tokomaks for fusion energy (collaboration with PPPL); (2) 15 kA CIC using MbB2 for a superconducting generator for >5 MW wind turbines; and (3) 25 kA CIC fusing Nb3Sn and Bi-2212 or 16 T dipoles for future hadron colliders."

The transmission line heats in temperature as it carries electric power, and the span of cable between towers stretches each time the temperature of the cable is increased. Repeated cycling to higher temperature in a transmission line that carries electric power with a day/night cyclic load fatigues the friction grip of the crimp joint, and it is doomed to fail after a large number of such cycles. The problem is made worse when a transmission line is required to carry an overload, either because of growing electric demand in an area or because of a temporary grid overload in a service region. Failures of splice joints are a recognized problem for grid security.
Accelerator Technology Corp. (ATC) proposes to develop a cable splice technology that employs friction stir-welding (FSW) to securely bond the aluminum wires of two cable ends to one another. FSW joins the aluminum wires and an aluminum sheath together to make a metallurgical bond, and the bond exhibits excellent electrical conductance and purging of oxidation from the metal. The weld is made without heating the cable, without need for cover gas. The FSW splice is stronger than the cable that it connects, and is not prone to robust against temperature cycling, even to temperature much greater than can be used with conventional splices. The FSW splice is also robust against corrosion and wind-driven oscillations.
In the Phase 1 effort the FSW process will be optimized to address two challenges that are unique to the cable splice application: the void space among strands must be crushed by compression before welding, and the dynamics of the rotary friction stir must be optimized to consolidate all remaining void space into two regions, so that the build of the weld is a solid strong aluminum bar. The effort will include subcontract efforts at Texas A&M University and at MTI, the most experienced company in FSW technology. ATC is undertaking the development in partnership with two utilities, one in Texas and one in Ohio, who are interested in placing the new splices into first use. The goal of the development is a splice that costs the same and takes the same time to install as conventional splices. But the FSW splice would be stronger than the cable it joins and would be more tolerant of occasional overloads on the transmission line. The benefits of the FSW cable splice are to eliminate the splice joint as the weak-sister of a
transmission line. The FSW splice will make it the last element to fail instead of the first. That improvement would reduce the vulnerability of the electric grid to line failures when a transmission line is operated above rated capacity, either because of growing electric demand or occasional grid overloads.

New frontiers in those areas of research require ever higher magnetic field strength, and that requires ever-more robust superconductors. Bi-2212 is the only one of the high-temperature superconductors that can be made in round wire. Improving its performance is of considerable importance for research in those fields. Performance is limited by two properties of the superconducting cores within the wire: too much porosity and the too little connectivity. ATC is developing a new way of making high-performance superconducting wire using the high-temperature superconductor Bi-2212. The method uses a roll-processing technique to orient the grains of the material so that they all lie in the direction in which current will flow in the wire. This favorable orientation is preserved in the final wire-drawing by making a jellyroll composite of the superconducting layers in silver foil. This jelly-roll method improves the porosity and connectivity in the wire, and has reasonable prospects to yield significant improvement in wire performance. The jelly-roll wire is made using a machine that is used in the pharmaceutical industry to roll compact powders of drugs to do the same thing for the superconducting powder. As the powder is roll-compacted its flake-like particles naturally orient so that their flat faces are parallel. The collaboration of Accelerator Technology Corp. and Texas A & amp;M University will use this approach to make continuous ribbons of the superconducting powder. The ribbons will be jacketed in a silver sheath and further compacted to form the jelly-roll round wire. In the proposed Phase 1 effort the team will commission the processing machinery and use it to make test coupons of the superconducting tape. The tape will be heat-treated to link all of the superconducting grains within the wire. The team will do a process development in which the parameters of that heat treatment are optimized to give the best possible performance. The jelly-roll superconducting wire is being developed to give higher current density for the magnets needed for high-energy accelerators and for spectrometers for biomedicine. The same process should work for the higher-temperature superconductor Bi-2223, which has important applications for high-efficiency electric motors and generators for electric power transmission, wind turbines, energy storage, and all-electric cars. Indeed Toyota is today developing a superconducting motor for its model of all-electric car. That motor utilizes Bi-2223. The textured jelly-roll method has the potential to provide major benefit for those applications"

Until recently, the low critical field of pure MgB2 had inhibited its use for higher-field applications, such as for high energy physics experiments. Yet, recent advances have demonstrated a dramatic enhancement of the upper critical field (Hc2) when MgB2 is doped with C or SiC. However, in all cases, the resulting material typically has demonstrated poor control of stoichiometry, homogeneity, and porosity. This project will develop a plasma reactor for preparing micron-scale particles of C-doped MgB2 on seed cores of B4C. Plume conditions will be controlled, so that C-doped MgB2 is formed with uniform stoichiometry and small grain size. Phase I will build an aerosol dispersion system and modify a commercial radio frequency (RF) plasma gun to support the aerosol powder flow and extended exit plume. In Phase II, the system will be used to synthesize C-doped MgB2, and a systematic optimization of process parameters will be conducted. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee: A C-alloyed MgB2, with less porosity and better homogeneity, should result in a superconductor with dramatically better performance.

This project will develop a particle-removal technology that disperses the powder in an aerosol suspension and then passes the dispersed powder through a Stokes-flow geometry, in which the powder particles are separated. The basic approach has been used for several decades for size classification, but never for separation of bulk quantities of powder. In previous work, a slot-geometry impactor was developed and evaluated for bulk separation applications. Phase I improved the earlier process in three respects: (1) dry nitrogen gas was used as the buffer gas rather than air, in order to eliminate contamination of the precursor powders; (2) a fluidized-bed dispersal system was developed to increase mass loading without aggregation; and (3) a boundary-sheet flow of powder-free gas was introduced along the walls of the impactor structure, in order to suppress particle wall interactions that limit large mass loadings. In Phase II, an electron-beam-assisted precipitator will be developed to remove the separated fines from the aerosol flow. The present pressurized inert-gas flow will be converted into a recirculating closed-circuit flow. The slot impactor vane structure will be rebuilt with 1-m-long vanes, and manifolds for supply, exhaust, and boundary flow along the vane structure will be pressure-equalized to assure a uniform Stokes threshold along the extended geometry. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee: In addition to high-performance superconductors, the technology also should be applicable to the separation of particles used in specialty sintered metal and ceramic materials for aerospace and defense, and in consumer products. For ceramics, large particles cause stress concentrations, which cause brittle fracture. For sunscreen, powders utilize Ti2O3, the most effective UV absorber; however, Ti2O3 is also the pigment for white paint, and makes skin appear pasty.

The process currently operates with ambient air as the suspension fluid for the aerosol process. However, an inert gas would be preferred because, in recent developments by PIT manufacturers, explosions have occurred during the jet-milling to micron particle size.

The properties of the materials used today for fuel cladding significantly limit the design options and performance for most Gen IV reactor concepts. This project will fabricate a composite tube containing layers of SiC-fiber cloth and HT-9 steel. The SiC fibers will provide strength reinforcement and extreme resistance to neutron damage; the HT-9 steel will provide a ductile support matrix. Full impregnation and surface bonding between the ceramic cloth and the steel matrix will be achieved using two proprietary steps: (1) applying an adhesion layer to the fibers prior to assembly of the composite, and (2) hot-drawing the lay-up composite through a SiC die set while the tube is inductively heated locally to near-melt of the steel. Corrosion resistance will be provided by bonding a thin Ta layer to the outer surface of the tube. Phase I will develop all process steps and fabricate the first samples of the composite tube. The samples will be sanctioned, and the bonding of the fibers within the steel matrix will be evaluated. A plan for scaling-up the fabrication process, to produce tubes with dimensions appropriate for fuel cladding in Gen IV reactor designs, will be developed. In Phase II, prototype tubes will be tested under conditions similar to those in a Gen IV reactor core (temperature, neutron flux, corrosion, internal swelling).

The approach adapts a technique called virtual impact sizing, in which the powder is dispersed in an air stream and passed through a sequence of nozzles. The nozzles are arranged so that the heavy particles must pass into one exit duct while the light particles pass into another duct, with a very sharp cutoff between the sizes that go the two ways. Phase I demonstrated 99.7% rejection of large particles from the small particle exit stream.

The presence of even a trace amount of large particles can ruin the superconducting properties of a large batch of wire, and limit the performance of all wire made with the powder-in-tube process. This project will apply an aerosol sorting technology to remove this limitation to superconductor cost and performance. The approach adapts a technique called virtual impact sizing, in which the powder is dispersed in an air stream and passed through a sequence of nozzles. The nozzles are arranged so that the heavy particles must pass into one exit duct while the light particles pass into another duct, with a very sharp cutoff between the sizes that go the two ways. Phase I demonstrated 99.7% rejection of large particles from the small particle exit stream. An optimal design was demonstrated to process 1kg/hour from each nozzle array at a cost of ~$30/kg, a significant result since high-performance superconducting wire costs $1,000-$10,000/kg today. Phase II will build and test a prototype sizing device, build a full-size sizing system (with kg/hour output), and evaluate its performance. Kilogram quantities of powders from four commercial superconductor manufacturers will be processed, and the superconducting performance of the resulting wire will be tested.

Virtual-impact processing (VIP), a technique originally developed to separate micron-size particles from air for environmental health studies, can be used to sort powders by particle size. By comparison to other techniques, VIP enables the removal of all particles with size greater than a desired threshold. This project will use a small-scale VIP to produce precursor powders of NbSn2, bronze, and sintered Bi-2212. The target particle size will be 2 mm; all particles of size > 4 mm will be removed.

no effective treatments that can be administered to infected individuals. Our approach centered
around a proprietary structure-based drug discovery engine, which combines rapid screening of

therapeutics development. Our method provides experimental validation and unprecedented
ability to visualize 3D protein-ligand interactions in a single step, delivering valuable actionable
assets (identification and definition of binding sites and binding pose) for immediate chemistry
and biology follow up in early drug discovery. Our goal is to target conserved amino acid residues
within these proteins to discover and advance molecules that may inhibit the SARS-CoV-2

and develop potential therapeutic agents for COVID-19 by targeting SARS-CoV-2 proteins
involved in viral attachment, fusion and replication. By targeting key proteins in SARS-CoV-2, that
are also conserved in other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS, we aim to develop therapeutic

throughput screening techniques Project Narrative
 Fragment based drug discovery FBDD is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry to provide novel
leads for developing new therapeutics It is based on the principle that small compounds andlt Da molecular
weight  which bind with low millimolar affinity can serve as useful building blocks for the development of novel
lead compounds X ray crystallography is the gold standard for determining the exact binding orientation of a
fragment as an essential step in this process However conventional crystallography is inefficient for
screening a large fragment library due to expense and effort Due to this complementary techniques such as
Surface Plasmon Resonance SPR  Thermal Shift Assay TSA or Nuclear Magnetic Resonance NMR  are
often used to prescreen for fragments that bind while protein crystallography is used in a second step to
determine the exact binding pose of each fragment
 An efficient cost effective crystallography based fragment screen can accelerate the development of
lead compounds by directly providing D structures of fragments bound to a target of interest The goal of this
proposal is to develop of a high throughput platform for crystallography based fragment screening leveraging a
novel high density sample crystallization grid which will require a very small volume of purified protein sample
 andlt  mg
 In this proposal we will evaluate the novel grid which will eliminate key bottlenecks associated with
crystallization produce apo crystals for fragments ligands soaks or co crystallization with fragments ligands
crystal mounting and rapid synchrotron data collection In Phase I we will test the grid for all experimental
steps including crystallization fragment soaking and data collection In Phase II we will optimize the grid design for
FBDD applications In addition we will integrate this technology into the Accelero Biostructures ABSTM platform by
further developing informatics and data analysis to efficiently handle large fragment library screens and rapidly
provide D fragment bound structures"

system. If left untreated, people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) will progress to AIDS and may ultimately die as a
result. Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) with small-molecule drugs is extremely effective at stopping
the replication of HIV-1 in infected individuals but requires daily dosing often with considerable side effects.
Importantly, despite the success of this approach at suppressing HIV-1 replication to clinically undetectable
levels, antiretroviral therapy is not curative. This is due to the persistence of HIV-1 in a silent, or latent, state
within long-lived CD4+ T cells at extremely low frequencies. These latently infected cells are not targeted by
current small-molecule ART regimens. As a result, PLWH must remain on lifelong antiretroviral therapy.Broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting critical epitopes in HIV-1 Env (HIV-1 bNAbs) are currently
being developed as a potential approach to eliminate latent HIV-1 and/or as an alternative to small-molecule
ART. HIV-1 bNAbs offer several advantages over traditional small-molecule ART, including the potential for
long-acting formulations, reduced side effects, and the potential to eliminate latently infected cells over time.
However, a major challenge to the implementation of HIV-1 bNAbs in treatment and cure is pre-existing
variation or resistance in the bNAb-targeted epitopes. Scalable clinical tests are needed to determine (1)
whether people who will receive HIV-1 bNAbs have pre-existing resistance, and (2) personalize HIV-1 bNAb
combinations to each individual. To address this critical unmet need, AccelevirDx is developing the HIV-1
EnvLRS assay as the first scalable sequence-based test to assess HIV-1 bNAb resistance and predict
antibody efficacy by in-depth env sequence analysis. Broadly, this proposal aims to (1) analytically qualify
AccelevirDxâs novel, proprietary HiFi-dePCR approach for env amplification underlying HIV-1 EnvLRS, (2)
determine the reproducibility of the HIV-1 EnvLRS assay of samples from PLWH, and (3) apply the assay to a
recently completed ACTG A5340 clinical trial of the HIV-1 bNAb VRC01 in PLWH to assess assay
performance and utility.PROJECT NARRATIVEBroadly neutralizing antibodies targeting the HIV Envelope protein (HIV bNAbs) are being developed as

HIV-1 infection can be controlled by available antiretroviral therapy, but cannot be cured due to the persistence of the virus in a quiescent, or latent state. This latent HIV-1 is the barrier to curing infection. While latent HIV-1 can be found in all infected individuals, it is present in very low frequencies. To cure HIV-1 infection, new therapeutics that eliminate latent HIV-1 must be developed. This development is hindered by current lack of a sensitive, accurate, and scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in infected individuals. The propose project seeks to develop and optimize a sensitive, accurate, and scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in the blood of infected individuals. Current tests used in research laboratories to measure latent HIV-1 are either non-specific or require large volumes of blood and many days to complete. This project is focused on developing a new molecular test that specifically measures latent HIV-1 from a minimal volume of blood in hours. Specifically, the project is focused on optimizing the preparation of blood samples and the reaction conditions necessary for robust performance of this new molecular test for latent HIV-1, as well as collecting samples from HIV-1 infected individuals to support future validation studies. Successful completion of this project will yield a latent HIV-1 test prototype that can be rapidly validated and advanced towards eventual clinical use."

Due to inherent technical and financial limitations at the âlast- mileâ of the data delivery pipeline, only a small fraction of these expensive Peta bytes of data is available for immediate access by end-users at any given time. This not only renders the usersâ work inefficient, but also risks the waste of significant amounts of information that could very well contain the keys to answering grand challenge questions. This project aims at solving this issue by providing the ground-breaking data compression technology able to multiply the capacity of existing (and future) last-mile âlive storageâ facilities by factors larger than 4x and up to 9x without any additional investment in hardware. The technology, which will be packaged as an open-source set of tools, will be integrated with ROOT/IO and will provide the users with full control in the form of easy to understand/use/modify/adapt according to the specific needs and technical sophistication of each user. The data compression technology is based on a novel and very rich theory of application-driven lossless compression that systematically analyzes the data in search of hidden redundancies that are not easily detected by traditional general-purpose compression. In addition, the theory provides fundamental mechanisms for achieving unprecedented lossless compression factors from a thorough understanding of the peculiar âand richâ interdependencies among the precisions of the data. This theory is complemented by very efficient and portable software implementations that we have developed in the last five years and which have already made paradigm- shifting impact of programs at NASA and DoD. Already successful for network-data and in-memory compression, this project will realize the power of the proposed data compression technology for nuclear physics I/O and storage. In Phase-I we surpassed our initial 2x compression target and successfully demonstrated factors as high as 3.9x in real-life datasets produced at the STAR experiment. The Phase-I compression factors are close to 3 times higher than what can be attained with the software available to the High Energy and Nuclear Physics (HENP) community today. Furthermore, the compression solution does not compromise the physics as it is designed for maintaining numerical integrity. In Phase-II we will capitalize on the substantial success delivered by the Phase-I, and further develop the technology to provide a robust software solution that could be used by other experiments around the world as means for improving data management and accessibility. With the integration of additional compression optimizations conceived in Phase-I, the Phase-II technology is expected to deliver 4x-9x compression. Once brought to life, the proposed technology will seamlessly boost the capacity of live storage facilities, which will in turn accelerate the pace of discovery in nuclear physics by enabling immediate access to significantly larger collections of data. The nuclear physics community would benefit of this technology in a very short time due to an infusion strategy that targets direct integration into the ROOT/IO framework. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: It is estimated by IDC that the amount of data that exists in the world is duplicated every 2 years. Even with declining costs of storage, this enormous growth of data makes storage one of the biggest cost elements in markets beyond nuclear and high energy physics, such as cloud computing, aerospace design, oil & gas exploration, weather modeling, among many others. Data compression has risen as a tool for seamlessly and inexpensively tackling the increasing demand for additional storage space. Prominent players from Oracle to Facebook to Google have already embraced data compression, contributing to a data compression software market that is expected to grow at approximately $864 million by 2023. The proposed technology is expected to positively disrupt this market, with a specialized offering for large-scale applications that rely on floating point data, precisely the type of information that our technology targets and that has been unsuccessfully addressed by traditional data compression solutions."

To address this problem, and with the ultimate goal of substantially accelerating OSF transmissions, Accelogic proposes a revolutionary theory of LOSSLESS data-compression especially suited for time-varying resource-scarce environments such as OSFÃ¢â¬â¢s. Instead of blindly adopting/improving existing data-compression algorithms, in this project we dig deep into the reasons that limit the impact of compression in OSF, and introduce a very robust technology for properly tackling them. Preliminary assessments show that this technology can provide 6x-60x compressions for a variety of messages in a real OSF operational environment (e.g.,Link-16,states-data). Accelogic has already demonstrated similar aspects of this technology, attaining 62x compressions for the acceleration of log message transmissions in cybersecurity applications. With a world-class multidisciplinary team and the collaboration of Teledyne-Brown-Engineering, Phase-I will render a fully functional prototype that demonstrates the potential of the technology for significantly reducing transmission times and storage requirements in the OSF.

Methods for the solution of these problems, usually called eigensolvers, are fundamental to many industrial and scientific applications ranging from computational chemistry problems to structural design, to other modeling- and simulation- intense disciplines that are at the core of DOEs scientific priorities, such as weather prediction, nuclear energy, nuclear weapon certification, and wind turbine design, among many others. Scientists working in these areas are always striving for increased computational performance. Modern heterogeneous supercomputing architectures (made of arbitrary combinations of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and possibly other types of cores) could provide the computational performance needed by large-scale eigensolvers. However, increasing performance in eigensolvers through heterogeneous computing is hard to achieve. The reason is that most eigensolvers and numerical software scale inefficiently when targeted to a large number of processors due to (1) communication becoming a primary burden, and (2) this burden being aggravated when transitioning into heterogeneous high-speed architectures. No industrial-quality scalable eigensolver library exists today that can efficiently exploit modern heterogeneous cores to deliver breakthrough speedups for eigenvalue-centric computations. Accelogic proposes to deploy the worlds fastest eigensolver numerical library, equipped to exploit heterogeneous HPC systems made of arbitrary combinations of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and possibly other types of cores integrated in the same supercomputing network. We propose two major innovations to attack the above-mentioned hurdles by: (1) implementing communication-avoiding eigensolver algorithms; and (2) introducing innovative approaches to guarantee scaling based on talent-aware heterogeneous load-balancing. Talent-aware heterogeneous load- balancing exploits the abilities that different computing cores have to execute particular numerical tasks. Accelogic has raised private sector matching funds tied to this SBIR project for an additional $1,000,000 such an investment is a testament to the strong commercialization potential of the proposed technology. The Phase I work demonstrated more than 10x acceleration factors for both direct and iterative solvers, in both single-processor and distributed environments. This result establishes the perfect foundation for a successful Phase II effort, which targets the first release of an industrial library of eigensolvers designed for heterogeneous HPC systems. The resulting library is expected to provide from two to three orders of magnitude speedups compared against existing eigensolver solutions. It will incorporate both direct (dense) and iterative (sparse) eigensolvers. A strong emphasis of the project is on achieving successful integration with high-impact HPC software, producing, shortly after the end of Phase II, breakthrough acceleration for a wide number of users.

The Phase I technology will be evaluated in three different scenarios: (A) Infrastructure Cloud outsourcing computations to Specialized Clouds, (B) Infrastructure Cloud making use of internal Specialized Clouds, and (C) End-users accelerating code through direct access to Specialized Clouds."

Methods for the solution of these problems, usually called eigensolvers, are fundamental to many applications in engineering and scienceranging from the most challenging computational chemistry problems in molecular design, to stability searches in structural design, to other modeling- and simulationintense disciplines that are at the core of DOEs scientific priorities, such as weather prediction, nuclear energy, nuclear weapon certification, and wind turbine design, among many others. Scientists working in these areas are always striving for increased computational performance. Modern hybrid supercomputing architectures (made of arbitrary combinations of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and possibly other types of cores) could provide the computational performance needed by large-scale eigensolvers, as has been done for linear equation solvers [Gonz09, Gonz10]. However, increasing performance in eigensolvers through hybrid computing architectures is, in general, harder to achieve than doing it for linear equation solvers. The reason: most eigenvalues software and numerical libraries scale inefficiently when targeted to a large number of processors due to (1) communication becoming a primary burden, and (2) this burden being aggravated when transitioning into heterogeneous high-speed architectures [HPCw10]. No industrial-quality scalable eigensolver numerical library exists today that can efficiently exploit heterogeneous concurrency of specialized cores (e.g., any combination of GPUs, FPGAs, Cell Processors, etc) to deliver breakthrough speedups for eigenvalue-centric computations. Accelogic proposes to deploy the worlds fastest eigensolver numerical library, equipped to exploit hybrid HPC systems made of arbitrary combinations of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and possibly other types of cores integrated in the same supercomputing network. We propose two major innovations to attack the above-mentioned hurdles by: (1) implementing communication-avoiding eigensolver algorithms; and (2) introducing innovative approaches to guarantee scaling based on talent-aware heterogeneous concurrency. Talent-aware heterogeneous concurrency exploits the abilities that different computing cores have to execute particular numerical tasks. For instance, a GPU is extremely fast for streamlined vector processing, but an FPGA has higher memory bandwidth when operating in its internal memory regime. Talent-aware heterogeneous concurrency considers these cores talents (i.e., capabilities) to optimally balance computing jobs, aiming at a nontrivial non-homogeneous partition of the computing jobs those results in overall reduction in time-to-solution. Accelogic has raised private sector matching funds tied to this SBIR project for an additional $500,000 such an investment is a testament to the strong commercialization potential of the proposed technology. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: This technology will have potentially large impact in industries such as structural design, chemistry, bioengineering, and computational physics, as well as in DOEs research programs in fusion energy, climate/weather modeling, nanoscale science, genomics, and study of nuclear matter, among many others."

As part of an ambitious research program funded by the Air Force, NASA, and DOE, Accelogic is spearheading the development of LAPACKrc, a groundbreaking family of FPGA-based linear algebra solvers able to achieve speedups larger than 1,000x with a single chip. Once completed, LAPACKrc will subsume both LAPACK and ScaLAPACK functionalities, as well as several ultra-fast sparse direct and iterative matrix solvers. Â Â Â Â The goals of this STTR are: (1)to develop the fundamental RC algorithmic technology for LAPACKrcs high-performance sparse iterative solvers; (2)to produce these solvers and their underlying math components as portable and easy-to-use LAPACKrc utilities; and (3)to aggressively integrate the LAPACKrc technology (sparse and otherwise) into higher-level solutions that enable the acceleration of PDE problems of high priority to the Air Force. Â Â Â Phase I produced the worlds fastest RC sparse iterative solver (150x speedups), demonstrating that it is possible to break the memory-access bottleneck through software-based non-von-Neumann algorithmic schemes. Phase II will continue this strong trend, using Accelogics proprietary technology and know-how to achieve 1,000x speedups through non-von-Neumann algorithms. Â Â Phase II/III follow-on funding commitments have been secured for a total of $550,000. BENEFIT: ---Anticipated Direct Benefits: A strong emphasis of this STTR is on maximizing technology transfer value to the Air Force. To this end, Â we will move aggressively into integrating all of the necessary elements of the LAPACKrc technology (including those produced by this STTR and all others already in place) to produce groundbreaking acceleration and/or enable high-priority Air Force applications. By the end of Phase II, we anticipate at least 6 success stories for which groundbreaking acceleration will be demonstrated. At least three of these successes will be attained with commercial partners. Four of the most dominant players in the CFD software industry ANSYS, Metacomp, NUMECA, and CHAM have provided letters of interest/commitment to participate in these Phase II integration efforts (letters attached). The other three success stories (and likely more) will come from Air Force programs. Four high-priority Air Force programs from WPAFB and Edwards AFB have submitted letters of interest/commitment to establish collaborations that will lead to the acceleration and/or enabling of: (1) applications of high-fidelity CFD for improved energy consumption and aerodynamic efficiency in Air Force&#039;s aircraft fleet, (2) advanced research in high temperature structural metals, (3) plasma physics, and (4) hypersonic propulsion systems; (letters attached). ---DoD Applications: As leading industry technologist and President of Metacomp Technologies, Dr. Sukumar Chakravarthy, says jointly with Dr. Dan Risha, Senior Research Scientist at AFRLs Aerospace Propulsion Division, Accelogics pioneering work on linear equations promises to set a tremendous milestone that will transform the landscape of modeling and simulation science as we know it today, thus enabling a significant leap in performance for important applications that are at the core of the Air Forces mission and of DoD missions in general. Â Those applications include CFD, structural analysis, computational molecular dynamics, chemistry, computational electromagnetics, machinery, combustion, plasma physics, weather and climate modeling, and earth sciences. These fields depend heavily on large-scale linear algebra kernels, and, prior to LAPACKrc, they had not yet seen significant benefits from the typical performance leaps of reconfigurable supercomputing, due to the difficulties that the RC community has had in achieving large speedups for linear equations. Â As highlighted in several of our Phase I reports, Â Accelogic is the first R&D group to have demonstrated large, sustained speedups for non-toy, large-scale linear equations of relevance to the aerospace industryand particularly to DoD. ---Non-DoD Applications: In addition to the DoD applications, many other applications are highly dependent on high-performance linear algebra, and those applications will be enabled by the acceleration levels (1,000x and up) targeted by Accelogic. Â They include circuit simulation, financial portfolio management optimization (interior point methods and linear programming), nuclear physics, power distribution network design, and radar signal processing. Â Each one these applications represents a significant market by itselfwith many of them crossing the $1 billion threshold. The ability to solve large-scale linear equations rapidly is a clear and fundamental driver for the following activities and/or industries both inside and outside of DoD: Â product design and performance simulation (aerospace, automotive, defense, boats, nuclear energy, electronic chips, power networks, radar, telecommunications, acoustics, buildings and bridges, drugs, chemistry, antennas and radio systems, machinery, combustion); economic forecasting (insurance, financial markets, budgeting, hedge funds management); physical forecasting (weather, environmental engineering, geophysics); and data analysis (defense, logistics, search engines, national security, gaming, marketing)."

Because high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) protects from CAD, current methods to assess risk measure the cholesterol content of HDL (HDL-C) as a surrogate indicator of HDL quantity. However, the function of HDL, namely its ability to efflux cholesterol, is what reduces CAD risk. Obesity and diabetes predispose to CAD and compromise HDL cholesterol efflux activity. Because direct quantification of cholesterol efflux activity is not amenable to clinical laboratories, we developed a novel assay that uses electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to report indirectly on HDL?s cholesterol efflux activity. Our assay is performed in approximately 10 minutes on less than 10Âµl of blood plasma/serum and is suitable for routine automated, high throughput clinical use. The objectives are: 1) validate the EPR assay compared to direct measurement of HDL cholesterol efflux activity, and 2) determine the predictive power of our assay to identify dysfunctional HDL in an established cohort of individuals with type 2 diabetes (METSIM). It is expected that this assay will have superior sensitivity and predictive power over all existing methods to determine CAD risk. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable rapid assessment of HDL function and accurately predict CAD risk, a multi-billion-dollar commercial opportunity in the medical diagnostics and drug development space. This project will develop and validate a rapid, sensitive and accurate assay that reports on HDL function. This innovative (first-in-class), discontinuous (goes beyond HDL-C), and transformational assay (highly specific measurement of HDL function directly in plasma) can be used as a diagnostic assay to identify patients at risk, even those with normal HDL-C levels, and as a surrogate outcome measure in clinical trials and patient management. The exceptional capability of our assay to serve as a window on metabolic disease status in an age- and gender-independent fashion is unprecedented. This technology promises to greatly improve the early diagnosis of CAD and metabolic disease predisposition and facilitate the discovery and implementation of interventions toprevent disease and significantly reduce long-term healthcare costs. The still broader use of EPR spectroscopy to measure structural changes in proteins as functional biomarkers of disease represents a platform innovation that denotes a new era of sophistication for molecular diagnostics."

During the last twenty years, the frequency of dining out has increased, with Americans currently eating restaurant-prepared foods an average of five to six times per week. Compared to meals prepared at home, restaurant fare tends to contain more calories, total fat, saturated fat, and sodium. Conventional efforts aimed at addressing the situation described above have focused on encouraging consumers to minimize eating out and/or guiding diners in identifying and selecting healthier menu options, approaches fraught with challenges. Instead, the  default strategy  approach proposed here seeks to test the feasibility of modifying standard restaurant recipes to include less cheese, oil, butter, mayonnaise, salad dressings, etc., to a degree that is not detected and/or is acceptable to restaurant customers. The modifications will result in corresponding reductions in the levels of calories, fat, saturated fat, and sodium. The advantage of the proposed approach is that restaurant consumers will benefit from the modified preparation methods without having to be knowledgeable about nutrition or motivated to make healthier choices. The consumer does not even need to take any specific action to benefit. Instead, this approach relies on the participation and cooperation of restaurants. The appeal of this approach to restaurants includes (1)lower food costs, and (2) the fact that, as menu legislation is requiring more restaurants to reveal nutrient values for their menu items, there is more interest by restaurants to improve the nutrition profiles. Restaurant chefs and RandD teams will workwith HEALTHY DINING, a California-based company with nearly two decades' experience in restaurant nutrition, to revise and then test modified recipes. During Phase I, three restaurant companies participated in establishing feasibility for the project. Several ingredients tested were successfully reduced by 12 to 25 percent and found to be acceptable to consumers. During Phase II, the research will (1) expand to examine the effect of modifying more restaurant meals from more restaurants, specifically prepared salads, sandwiches, burgers, soups, pasta dishes, and heavily buttered side dishes; (2) investigate ways to improve measurement accuracy when small-to- moderate ingredient modifications are made (3) calculate nutrition improvement achieved by the successful modification as well as cost savings to the restaurants and estimated impact on public health if adopted by the restaurant industry.

Immediate benefits include the ability to detect cutaneous leishmaniasis on a disease-stage basis (acute/chronic) and generation of revenues to a US small business concern. Downstream potential benefits include utilization of the knowledge to develop a useful monitoring kit for a leishmaniasis vaccine currently under development and application and modification of the current research and development approach to other parasitic diseases in the future."

There are four distinct dengue virus types (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4), each capable of causingdisease in humans. The conserved 3Â¿_-noncoding sequences of four dengue virus serotypes have been successfully utilized to develop as a TaqMan-based RT-PCR (funded by MIDRP STO A/L) to quantitatively identify dengue viruses from different regions of theworld. The 0bjective of this phase I proposal is to transit the mature real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology of the dengue 3Â¿_-noncoding region based assay system (develop by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research)into a field deployable and user-friendly diagnostics device, so that the dengue diagnostics technology can be used in the dengue-endemic areas where the US military may be deployed in the future. Access Bio will optimize and scale up production of thefluorogenic RT-PCR reagent kits for serotype-specific dengue virus detection. We will develop lyophilized kit components, then evaluate the kit sensitivity, specificity, and stability using various concentrations of cultured dengue virus or dengue viruscDNA. Access Bio has developed a proprietary fluorescence technology that we will prove for this application. According to the Center for Disease Control, as of 1997 dengue became the most important mosquito-borne viral disease affecting humans. Its global distribution is comparable to that of malaria and an estimated 2.5 billion people live in areas at risk forepidemic transmission. Each year, tens of millions of cases of dengue fever occur and, depending on the year, up to hundreds of thousands of cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). In addition, increased travel by airplane provides the ideal mechanism fortransporting dengue viruses between population centers of the tropics, resulting in a constant exchange of dengue viruses and other pathogens. After successful research in the phase I study and followed by extensive research in phase II, this system couldbe immediately commercialized through the US military, the Center for Disease Control, US public health agencies, the Pan American Health Organization, and health organizations in countries where dengue is endemic. If this technology is feasible, we willlicense out the products developed to partner larger diagnostics companies for marketing. Given the increased the spread of dengue virus epidemic transmission concerns, the products developed to detect serotype specific dengue virus will likely seeconsiderable market opportunity."

environmental risk factor for premature morbidity and mortality on the planet. Human exposure to particulate air
pollution is largely estimated using data from stationary outdoor monitors installed in heavily populated areas.
These data might not reflect exposures in rural communities or vulnerable subpopulations. Further, there is
evidence that these data do not capture the unique exposure of a given individual, who likely spends most of
their time indoors and transitions between multiple locations (e.g., home, work) throughout the day. Therefore,
a need exists to improve our understanding of how the timing and magnitude of human exposure to particulate
air pollution relates to specific sources as well as individual behaviors or tasks.
The goal of this SBIR Phase IIB project is to improve our ability to assess human exposure to PM (and
subsequent health outcomes) by coupling a real-time sensor with a filter-based sampler (for in-situ gravimetric
validation) in a small, lightweight, quiet, wearable device. This coupling will improve our ability to estimate time-
and location-resolved PM exposure for outdoor, indoor, and personal exposure monitoring. To help users
harness the data from this device, we will develop data analysis and visualization software using a popular,
open-source platform (the R Statistical Software Project). To validate device performance and to evaluate its
usefulness to the research and environmental justice communities, we propose a field demonstration in rural
and urban communities in the San Joaquin Valley of Californiaâan area known to suffer from high levels of fine

Superfund sites pose a significant risk to human health for those living nearby as they have high levels of toxic
chemicals that can impact the local water and soil chemistry, leading to a myriad of diseases including kidney
disease, cancer, and heart disease. Currently the Superfund site list consists of ~1400 active or proposed sites
in the United States. There is an on-going need to measure remediation effectiveness and monitor toxic
chemical levels over time to minimize the risk to surrounding populations. Heavy metals are common toxic
chemicals found in Superfund sites. Traditional laboratory methods are capable of measuring metals but are
subject to long lead times (often weeks) as well as high instrumentation and labor costs. As a result,
measurements are performed infrequently and can result in unanticipated releases, putting surrounding
communities at risk. Because of these problems, several point-of-need measurement technologies are used to
measure heavy metals at Superfund sites, including X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and colorimetric test kits, but
both approaches have significant limitations. The field, and Superfund sites in particular, lack simple sensors
that can measure multiple toxic metals simultaneously with minimal user steps and at relevant concentration
levels. The goal of this project is to develop a multiplexed water quality monitoring system for measuring toxic
metals in ground and surface water at Superfund sites using Access Sensor Technologyandapos;s On-TargetÂ® card
system. On-TargetÂ® cards quickly and easily measure metal concentrations in water using proprietary
colorimetric reactions that generate a colored circle with a diameter proportional to concentration. While we
have made significant progress with this technology, it is not applicable to Superfund site monitoring today
because current detection limits are too high (ppm versus ppb) and the cards only detect a single metal,
meaning users must carry a large number cards with them for complete profiling. During Phase I, we will focus
on reducing the detection limits (Aim 1), creating the multiplexed assay (Aim 2), and developing first generation
data visualization software while performing initial field studies (Aim 3). Samples from the Lincoln Park site
(abandoned Uranium milling site) in Fremont County, Colorado will be used for testing. Our sensing system will
be validated against ICP-MS or AAS for rigor. At the end of Phase I, we will have successfully created a
prototype second-generation On-TargetÂ® product that enables multiplexed metal analysis at concentration
levels relevant to our customers. The effort will position us for both further development during Phase II with
additional analytes and penetration into the market through connections with early adopters.Project Narrative:
The goal of this project is to develop a multiplexed paper-based analytical device for detection of heavy metals
at the 10 ppb level in surface and ground water at Superfund sites. Our approach builds on our On-TargetÂ®
card technology that detects single metals at 1 ppm levels to achieve this critical objective. After developing the
system, we will test the new cards at the Lincoln Park site in Colorado."

Antibody testing provides information regarding previous infections; a simple tool to detect presence at low concentrations enables better testing to manage social distancing needs. The proposed technology aims to make blood testing for SARS-Cov-2 simple and quantitative for two types of antibodies. The device will be developed to take patient samples directly with no complicated sample prep. Unique reagents will be created for selective detection of the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop the next generation of low-cost point of care immunoassay technology with direct application to infectious disease detection. The technology proposed here combines a new approach to controlling capillary flow driven systems applied to the steps of a traditional ELISA in a disposable device. The device developed in this project will detect SARSCoV-2 specific antibodies in patient samples, and will be able to provide information about the phase of the immune response of a patient. Additionally, adaption of ELISA-like enzymatic amplification into a point-of-care device will provide greater sensitivity and selectivity than traditional lateral flow assays, increasing assay sensitivity and improving detection of early infections. The immunoassays will be evaluated with deidentified patient samples and compared to state of the art laboratory-based detection methods.

Successful completion of this project will yield a novel air sampling technology that will help improve the reliability and data quality obtained from lowcost air monitoring networks; these networks are valuable for regulatory monitoring networks, fence-line emissions monitoring (e.g., wildland fire, industrial operations, energy production),
academic and community-based research on air quality, climate and health, military, and citizen science.SUMMARY OF ANTICIPATED RESULTS:
In Phase I we propose to advance and test a novel, lightweight, outdoor air sampling system (named the SPARC sampler) for use as a solution for lower cost, field-based calibration. Data generated during Phase I will be used to validate the performance of the SPARC technology and to evaluate the efficacy of several sensor calibration techniques. To accomplish this work we will product 25 field-ready prototypes, deploy a network of SPARC devices co-located with commercially-available standard reference monitors and low-cost PM sensors, and evaluate the utility of the SPARC sampler as a node-calibration system for a low-cost sensor network and against existing calibration approaches."

Metals represent an important class of water contaminants that come from a variety of sources including mining, transportation, manufacturing, waste management, and energy production. The U.S. EPA has developed water-quality regulations that require periodic monitoring for specific metals, such as: nickel, chromium, iron, and zinc (and many more). These regulations have largely driven the development of the environmental water-quality market sector, within which we will initially target mining, energy production, and waste management segments. At present, however, the cost of monitoring toxic metals is high (hundreds of dollars per sample) given the large numbers of samples that must be analyzed across the life cycle of many of these sites. Our technology is simple and inexpensive and thus will allow for more frequent monitoring to better protect critical water supplies from contamination. The long-term impact from this technology is a significant cost reduction needed to protect and monitor our nation?s water resources. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel, sensitive technology for metals in water. This technology, called the Chemometer, is inexpensive and portable and requires no power and no external reading equipment. Quantifying metals in water is presently done using large, expensive laboratory equipment with costs of>$100/sample. Current portable measurement systems (most notably X-Ray Fluorescence) are not well suited to aqueous samples. Thus, a need (and a viable market) exists for simple, portable, power-free measurement tools that enable rapid in-field quantification of metals in water. Our approach will be substantially less expensive and simple to use. The Chemometer is made on ordinary filter paper using innovative barrier printing technology. Reagents are selectively patterned on the paper to give selective and sensitive measurements of metals in water. Quantifying metal concentrations is done by simply measuring the length of a colored region on the Chemometer once the assay is complete. The Chemometer is portable (and disposable), making streamside measurements feasible in all sorts of resource-poor locations."

Based on several research studies, approximately 50% of manual wheelchair users (MWU) report symptoms of repetitive strain injury (RSI) related to the demand on the upper extremity during propulsion and transferring tasks. A substantial effort has gone toward understanding and trying to reduce the incidence of RSI through improved wheelchair technology, training, and clinical practice. Despite these efforts, it is still argued that all long-term (gt15yrs) MWU are likely to acquire a RSI. Technical advances, such as lighter and more adjustable wheelchairs have helped reduce the risk factors for RSI by decreasing the average propulsion force and increasing the stroke length during propulsion. By decreasing overall risk for RSI, these technical advances make progress, but more can and should be done to help preserve the mobility independence of MWU. A persistent problem during manual wheelchair propulsion is the difficulty while propelling over sloped terrain. Outdoors, sloped terrains are unavoidable-running-slopes (in the direction of travel) are necessary to transitions from one grade to another, andcross-slopes are required for water drainage. Although the ADA accessibility guidelines place upper limits on the allowable angle of these slopes these limits are often not followed, and any sloped surface can be burdensome to a MWU and increase the risk of an RSI, especially the cross-slope angle. Research findings suggest that a cross-slope angle of 2 degrees requires a 30% greater effort than propelling on flat ground. Additionally, based on perceived comfort, a one degree increase in cross-slope is equivalent to a 3.6 degree increase in running slope. Other research has demonstrated that an 80% increase in propulsive forces is necessary when propelling over a 6 degree cross-slope. The underlying mechanism causing the increased propulsion demand and decreased comfort is the tendency of the wheelchair to drift down the slope. This is due location of the center of gravity (which is forward of the rear axle) and the unconstrained rotation of the caster wheels. The goal of this project is to finalize the development and testing of the PathLock system, which biases the caster to maintain a strait path. Our Phase I prototype was positively received by clinicians and WCUs and valuable feedback was gathered about design modifications. Year 1 of this proposal will be to finalize the design and testing of the PathLock for TiLite TR wheelchairs, and Year 2 will be devoted to adapting the PathLock to other varieties and classifications of MWCs.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to finalize thedesign and development of the Pathlock system, which biases a wheelchair caster to help the user maintain a straight path during propulsion. This can be helpful if a user is carrying an object in one hand, is traveling over a cross-slope, or has unilateralfunctional deficit (such as hemiplegia)."

The three primary drawbacks are (1) the increased weight of the rigid backrests over the sling systems, (2) discomfort when the user wants to perform non-mobility tasks, like dressing or relaxing (leaning back) , and (3) the inability to use the rigid shells on a folding-frame wheelchair. If these design shortcomings were mitigated, market penetration would increase substantially. We developed a Light-weight, Durable, Adjustable backrest (LWDAC) which addresses shortcomings (1) and (2) and was verywell received by focus groups subjects. In this Phase II project, we will refine the LWDAC based on subjects' feedback, and introduce a quick-release mechanism to address shortcoming (3), which has already been developed for our other backrest system.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the increased comfort and postural support that rigid wheelchair backrests provide, some users reject them because they restrict function during non-mobility tasks, like dressing or relaxing. To address these shortcomings,we have developed a Lightweight, Durable, Adjustable, Composite backrest system which allows the user to independently and easily adjust their backrest for all tasks."

Based on several research studies, approximately 50% of manual wheelchair users (MWU) report symptoms of repetitive strain injury (RSI) related to the demand on the upper extremity during propulsion and transferring tasks. A substantial effort has gone toward understanding and trying to reduce the incidence of RSI through improved wheelchair technology, training, and clinical practice. Despite these efforts, it is still argued that all long-term (gt15yrs) MWU are likely to acquire a RSI. Technical advances, such as lighter and more adjustable wheelchairs have helped reduce the risk factors for RSI by decreasing the average propulsion force and increasing the stroke length during propulsion. By decreasing overall risk for RSI, these technical advances make progress, but more can and should be done to help preserve the mobility independence of MWU. A persistent problem during manual wheelchair propulsion is the difficulty while propelling over sloped terrain. Outdoors, sloped terrains are unavoidable-running-slopes (in the direction of travel) are necessary to transitions from one grade to another, and cross-slopes are required for water drainage. Although the ADA accessibility guidelines place upper limits on the allowable angle of these slopes, these limits are often not followed, and any sloped surface can be burdensome to a MWU. Consequently, this uneven terrain can and increase the risk of an RSI, and decrease the likelihood that a MWU will go out and participate in society. especially the cross-slope angle. Research findings suggest that a cross-slope angle of 2 degrees requires a 30% greater effort than propelling on flat ground. Additionally, based on perceived comfort, a one degree increase in cross-slope is equivalent to a 3.6 degree increase in running slope. Other research has demonstrated that an 80% increase in propulsive forces is necessary when propelling over a 6 degree cross-slope. The underlying mechanism causing the increased propulsion demand and decreased comfort is the tendency of the wheelchair to drift down the slope. This is due location of the center of gravity (which is forward of the rear axle) and the unconstrained rotation of the caster wheels. Shifting the center of gravity location rearward has largely been discarded as a solution because it can lead to instability, and solutions to address instability (such as anti-tip mechanism) limit independent mobility. The alternate solution, of locking the caster orientation has been developed, but current designs are impractical because they require the MWU to either lock/unlock the caster frequently, or perform wheelies to turn. The goal of this research is to evaluate the feasibility of a caster system which biases the caster system orientation to counteract drift on a cross-slope, but does not impair the ability for the MWU to make a desired turn. We have prototyped a bench-top version of this design, and have performed preliminary testing to quantify the bias necessary to counteract the down-slope drift. The goal of this research is to (1) prototype a caster system which can be fit to a manual wheelchair, (2) test the feasibility of the device in focus groups with MWU and clinicians, and (3) test the product durability using ANSI/RESNA wheelchair standards.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Wrist and shoulder complications are prevalent among wheelchair users due to the repetitive strain on the upper limb during manual wheelchair propulsion. Evidence suggests that propulsion over a surface with a cross-slope can result in an 80% increase in require push-rim force, increasing the risk of upper limb injury. Our goal it to determine the feasibility of a caster system which would reduce or eliminate these increased forces while propelling over sloped terrain and help increase community participation and quality of life."

Electro-hydrodynamic wind energy conversion (EHD-WEC) is a non-turbine based means of producing electricity from wind employing charged particles driven against a voltage gradient. A minimum of moving parts and fundamental simplicity gives EHD-WEC the potential to be disruptively lighter and cheaper than its mechanical counterparts. The opportunity exists to apply recently developed efficient droplet generation means, such as advanced electrospray and MEMS-based microfabrication of electrospray nozzles, as well as real-time system controls, to craft a system with significantly positive net energy balance. Renewable, non-fossil fuel based approaches to electrical generation are of interest worldwide. Demand for electricity is projected to rise steadily due to population growth and development in emerging economies. Simultaneously the price of oil and other fossil fuels is projected to rise as pressure is put on existing supplies. In addition, there is widespread interest in carbon neutral energy sources. If EHD-WEC&#039;s potential to significantly lower the cost of generating electricity from wind can be realized, the broader impacts will be global in nature; providing the world with a renewable source of energy, and creating many new ?green? jobs in the US, as well as reducing national dependence on foreign fossil fuel providers."

NG9-1-1 allows the multimedia data and multiple streams of input to enhance situational awareness, to gauge the nature and extent of an incident, and to improve the confidence of responses.The key opportunity is to mitigate risk from malicious actors. Though low probability, the impact of a PSAP system failing in the midst of a critical event could be unacceptably costly. The secondary opportunity is to improve the situational awareness of the PSAP staff enabling them to more effectively respond to an evolving incident.This proposal describes a system that integrates AI and cybersecurity software with advanced networking to connect video processing, compute, and storage to implement a more secure PSAP for NG9-1-1.Proof of concept will be demonstrated as part of Phase I, with a prototype being implemented for Phase II.This platform could then be re-targeted for use in the financial, medical and video processing industries."

The success of the program hinges on the fusion of data across multiple sensors to provide robust detection with no false negatives and few false positives. Another factor in the architecture of the system is that technology is continually evolving. This requires the flexibility to interconnect high volume raw sensor data with new algorithmic processing units with minimal (or no) impact on current operations. The program seeks to achieve these objectives while minimizing the overall system cost and footprint.

Today, ISR system integrators have three main goals: minimize latency, maximize system bandwidth, and optimize configuration flexibility within the platform SWaP constraints. The USAF Program Manager has a diminishing set of options to address those constraints. PCI Express (PCIe) solutions rapidly transfer data between Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) logic, processors, and memory. For example, in many High Frequency Trading (HFT) systems, rapid data transfers are needed between FPGA logic and the Order Management System (OMS) software. For these frequent and short transactions, PCIe solutions are optimal for minimizing latency. Accipiter SystemsÃ¢â¬â¢ PCIe networking solution delivers a low-latency, high throughput data path for real-time sensor processing applications.

The fabric interconnect will support both unicast and multicast transmissions, will be managed using software-defined networking (SDN) application programming interfaces (API), and will have in-system firmware and software upgradeability. The Phase II option proposal expands the networking solution to include a VPX-based interconnect interface card (IIC) to install directly into the RF digitizer chassis. This will enable the system to forward digitized RF data to one or more destinations, managed under software control. Combined, the Phase II and Phase II option development will represent the first step in implementing and validating a flexible and scalable multi-protocol multi-terabit fabric for submarine SIGINT and EW systems.

The transport is based on photonic switching; information is switched based solely on the wavelength upon which the data stream is modulated. As a result, the transport is protocol transparent and therefore able to support multiple protocols simultaneously. Two main classes of protocols have been identified, those transporting raw digitized RF data and those transferring network data. In the latter case, the system is able to support any of the common protocols such as PCIe, 10/40/100 Gbps Ethernet, Fibre Channel, etc. The system core uses no power; the end systems use low power optical transmitters and receivers to reduce the overall energy demand in providing this connectivity.

To meet the Air Force""s need for a high capacity optical backplane network for satellites built to meet the Operationally Responsive Space directives, Accipiter Systems is proposing to develop an Optical Burst Mode networking system with a passive optical core and intelligent ASIM modules that interface the optical network to sensors, processors and shared storage. The system is controlled by a central MAC controller, which will also be developed under the program and which ensures that network contention, congestion and traffic priority are handled effectively and without loss of data. The architecture will initially support up to 10 Gbps serial data between end systems. The data rate can also scale to 40 Gbps and above with no change in the optical core network. Accipiter Systems has gained considerable expertise in burst mode optical networking, working on programs for the Army, NAVAIR and DARPA. BENEFIT: The architecture developed on this program will allow implementation of a high bandwidth, all passive optical core for the satellite optical backbone. The proposed architecture will reduce space, weight, and power requirements for the satellite network as well as reduce the time for deployment configuration of satellites by providing a standard network for satellite payloads including sensors, processors, and shared storage."

ogy, Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS). Our approach follows these three steps: 1) Quantify tumor exposure to chemotherapy in individual patients at the earliest stages of therapy; 2) Quantify tumor-level response to treatment in individual patients by d
eveloping validated biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy; 3) Optimize each patient&#039;s treatment by adjusting dose, dose schedule, or by placing the patient on a different course of therapy. Currently, laboratory methods enabling this approach are only partial

The developed instrument will provide a simple means for in-situ measurement of the bulk density of powdery substances such as powdered foods, cosmetics, chemicals, and soils. In the food and cosmetics processing industries it will provide a monitoring and feedback tool that will improve the control of milling, grinding, mixing and packing processes. In agriculture it will allow the assessment of soil type suitability for optimum crop selection thus assisting in the increase of the net overall yield of the worlds food producing soils. For example, peach trees do not thrive and produce well in compacted, high density soils. It will also provide soil density, compaction and infiltration data that will aid in more effective irrigation practices, thus assist in improving crop yields, crop quality, conservation of fresh water, and minimization of stream contamination from agricultural runoff.2. For use in food and cosmetics factories the instrument could be packaged as a production-line-mounted instrument that is exposed to the powdery material being manufactured. Feedback fro the instrument could be used to control the upstream grinding or milling processes thus maintaining a consistent density in the produced product. In agrictural applications it could be mounted to a Pogo-stick-like handle where manual probings could be made. The readout device would contain a GPS unit and cellular radio so that the probed data could be relayed directly to a cloud-based database where the density readings would be mapped. The resulting mapped density information would then be used by agricultural people in assessing their fields for optimum use in food production. Alternately, the device could be mounted to a hydraulically actuated probe on a tractor (perhaps a driverless model) that would automatically take the readings and deposit the data to the cloud. Such an implementation would be the foundation of service businesses throughout the world that would provide soil mappings to farmers.3. The ultimate goal of this product for Acclima, Inc is a significant increase in business revenues through the manufacture and sale of the instruments proposed in (2) above.

Because of residual reflections from circuit board striplines terminated in variable soil loads and reflections from wetting fronts and discontinuities in the soil, the derivation of propagation time, permittivity and water content are subject to errors caused by the vector addition of the spurious, shorter-term reflections with the main reflection from the end of the waveguide. The characteristics of the interfering spurious signals vary with the soil environment. The overall waveform appearing at the TDR digitizer is a composite image of an incident step, a reflected wave and the set of spurious signals. The research required is that of characterizing the spurious signal patterns and of developing machine learning and signal processing algorithms to remove their impact from the derivation of reflected wave propagation time. Identification and timing of wetting fronts will also be included to provide sensor users with infiltration monitoring capability. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide an affordable and easily deployed means of accurately measuring soil water content, including the credible measurement of water uptake by food crops. This capability will facilitate significant increases in water use efficiency - the foundation for growing high quality food with less water. The value proposition to crop growers is reduced marginal costs and increased crop yield and quality, with a potential payback time of one to two growing seasons. Commercial adoption of soil moisture sensing technology will help manage the increased cost and demand for fresh water, of which over 70% of consumption goes to agriculture. The technology will also provide a stable and credible measurement tool for studying and monitoring watershed dynamics for flood and drought prediction, for monitoring dams, mudslide areas and levees for potential failure and for studying the impact of soil water dynamics on weather.

The architecture is flexible and can be optimized for the algorithm or resource and physical requirements. Using trade studies that consider generic program performance, tamper-resistance and stealth/physical footprint constraints, Accord will create a version of CRIPTC that specifically executes AES for loading FPGA bit-streams, protecting them from side-channel attacks. Lockheed Martin will subject the resulting tamper-resistant FPGA bit stream loading system for test and evaluation. By porting to a program tactical FPGA the technology can reach TRL 7 at project completion.

In addition, there is low impact on HPC software development, with minimal impact on typical HPC working sets, with slight latency increases for disk IO and interprocessor communication. The RASP system uniquely distributes a single binary executable to each processor authenticated to execute it. Authentication by the OLF provides assurance that access is made only by validated processors. Data input and output is likewise protected, but with different keys, ensuring that no user can access the binary executable for reverse engineering exploitation. Parallel processing uses a different set of RASP keys to protect interprocessor communication.

The purpose of this proposal is to address whether y-ray lens technology can enable an improved system for imaging radioactive isotopes in patients. In nuclear medicine, it is often desirable to generate a y-ray image that shows the exact areas where an emitting isotope is located. The motivation for proposing a y-ray lens for radionucide imaging is the potentially significant advantages that it may provide over existing technology, specifically in terms of superior image resolution, reduced radioactive dose to the patient, and cost. The proposed effort will develop the conceptual design of a y-ray lens system for radioactive isotope imaging, predict its performance, estimate its cost, and compare it with existing nuclear medicine imaging technology. The questions this work will answer are: (1) Does the y-lens provide better resolution than existing systems? (2) Does they-lens efficiency enable lower radioactive doses to be administered to patients? (3) Can the y-lens system be built sufficiently compact to fit within existing treatment facilities? The answers to these questions will establish the practical feasibility of 7-ray lenses for imaging radioactive isotopes in patients. Anticipated Benefits: The anticipated benefits of a y-ray lens system for radioisotope imaging include: superior imaging, less patient exposure to radioactive dose, and cost savings. There are also a number of other potential conu-nercial applications of y-ray lenses, including angiography optics (cardiac imaging), arms control instrumentation, and cancer therapy. This proposed effort will determine whether y-lens technology is commercially feasible for these."

This project will enable responders to use a lightweight, portable device that will decrease the time to stabilize a patient during critical situations by developing a new device to measure the patientâs tidal volume, or volume of air moved through the lungs in a ventilation cycle. With this measurement, responders will be able to treat patients more effectively, efficiently and safely.

The proposed project will further develop a device to measure tidal volume and deliver breaths using tightly controlled pressure levels and respiration rates. It will calculate and measure tidal volume, respiratory rate, and minute ventilation; furthermore, it will dynamically adapt to leaks and detect airway obstruction during emergency ventilation, providing instant and accurate feedback to responders and avoiding any possible injury to the patient. In this Phase I project we will extend prior research by building a compact device to be worn on the responderâs arm or in a sling. We will: 1) build and test smaller electronics and sensors in a prototype; 2) develop advanced monitoring algorithms; 3) conduct bench-tests on patient simulators to optimize the system; 4) conduct display and wearability tests. The end goal of this project is to provide an ultra-portable prototype that meets or exceeds the performance of ventilators normally used in intensive care unites, broadening the impact to all patients requiring lifesaving ventilation.

Today many cancer patients die due to tumors that are non responsive to
standard chemotherapy and unfortunately to date there is no way to identify
these patientsOur proposed novel glycan based method will reduce mortality by

The process employs computer simulations to model the forming process and compute a 2D fabric pattern as well as a four degrees of motion machine to form the fabric over the curved radome tool. The targeted part properties are those measured by quality control inspections currently employed in the forming process. The accuracy of placement will be determined by measuring the chine overlap and chine butt joint between plies. Phase II will utilize the process and various deliverables from Phase I and provide the platform for the manufacture of a full scale radome. This pilot demonstration will validate the process and manufacturing methods that will ultimately be incorporated into an automated machine. BENEFIT: The successful demonstration of automation of material placement over complex curvature yielding full mechanical properties would present benefits for the Air Force, Air Force OEM""s, and the aircraft industry.  The automation will result in i) lower part manufacturing cost by reducing the total operator interaction ii) reduced touch labor by eliminating hand forming of material by an operator iii) higher quality, repeatable parts by eliminating operator error and inconsistencies iv) potential reduction of quality control inspections. The resultant machine automation and process development will lead to other platforms and concepts for the automation of other complex curvature parts used in aerospace manufacturing."

The CH-53K spar was the study focus. The recommended work cell concept combines automated tape placement, woven fabric placement, and pick and place of 45Â° parallelograms to layup plies, then debulk and place packs for two spars fabricated in tandem. All composite material placement, vacuum bag material application, pack-to-tool debulking, and spar revolution is automated. This Phase 2 program develops the stations on the work cell machinery encompassing the material lay-up portion of the proposed work cell, and then demonstrates them for inclusion in a follow-on full design. Special attention will be paid to placing at rates high enough to allow fabrication of 200 spars per year (4 per week). In Phase 2, Accudyne proposes to complete a Requirements Document to detail requirements learned from NAVAIR, Sikorsky, and Hexcel. Then, Accudyne proposes to develop equipment and the process to demonstrate: 1) unidirectional tape placement into plies and on-line debulking to packs, 2) woven fabric placement into plies and on-line debulking to packs 3) bias parallelogram cut, pick, and place and debulking, 4) cutting of unidirectional tape, woven fabric, and bias parallelograms, and 5) a technical trade study encompassing throughput, tolerances, debulking, quality control, machine maintenance, risks, and final implementation. A final report describing the process, equipment, and trade study will conclude Phase 2. The Phase 2-Option program enhances bias ply placement to considerably accelerate spar fabrication. The enhancement is a 3-axis CNC-controlled ultrasonic knife to complete articulate cuts in the bias parallelograms that comprise the bias plies. The noteworthy benefit is that net shape bias packs can be fabricated with the wide ply down with no further cutting. It is intended that the Phase 2-Option run in concert with Phase 2 for maximum synergy."

The overall process has two distinct phasesâR&D and Production. The Production phase has experienced many improvements with lean and agile manufacturing techniques applied throughout the supply chain. Comparatively, the R&D phase has experienced relatively minor improvementsâmost of which are from modernizing various tools, but not changing the underlying processes. As a result, one of the biggest opportunities for improving the delivery times of complex technology is in the R&D Project Management process. The current project management methods used for complex R&D projects were developed over sixty years ago for projects that had a lot less complexity and uncertainty. One of the key issues is that the work in R&D is largely invisible. So itâs difficult to tell who is working on what, and where the bottlenecks are. As a result, slips in the schedule are hard to notice. Our solution (Playbook) solves these problems with a proprietary methodology based on principles from the bodies of knowledge of Lean, Agile, and Theory of Constraints. These methods have been proven to cut development times by 30%-50%.

 producing high risk for sudden myocardial infarction (MI), through plaque
 rupture and subsequent thrombotic response, or thrombosis generated at the
 inflamed plaque surface. It cannot be located by angiography, and has been
 estimated to account for 60-70 percent of fatal MIs and up to 85 percent of all
 MIs. Accumed Systems, Inc. will develop a Thermal Sensing Catheter (TSC) to identify
 unstable plaque. Such measurements have been made in research labs, but no such
 product now exists. Technological innovation to achieve this includes
 developing new micro-thermistor and specialized manufacturing techniques to
 embed them in sensing arms, as well as developing new and novel testing
 techniques. It will measure the surface temperature of the inner wall of
 coronary arteries at multiple sites and identify sites of unstable plaque."

The system requirements encompass demanding features including capacity to acquire up to 256rotor-mounted sensors at up to 31,720 samples per second. Programmable sampling strategies, and signal conditioning configurations are required. A Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) interface will transmit this data from the helicopter rotor hub to aground station up to 1000 feet away at rates of at least 10 Mbit per second.The feasibility of many of the required features of this system has already been demonstrated in commercial rotor telemetry systems manufactured by the proposers. Therefore the research in Phase I will focus on a few key areas that are of concern todetermine feasibility. These involve the transmission range of a IEEE 802.11 compliant wireless link from antennas mounted on the rotor hub to the ground station, particularly if the aircraft fuselage produces a shadowing effect. System architecture,implementation strategy and commercial component options will also be investigated, and a preliminary design will be developed. This project could lead to a tool that will help engineers and scientists who study the performance of helicopters to acquire data from large numbers of sensors mounted on rotor blades and other rotating components.

For example, high-speed motion sensing without line-of-sight limitations can play an important role in understanding the dynamics of human body motion and ergonomics, allowing applications for sports and industrial training to evolve. The existing â¨3D man-machine interaction market is segmented into a few small application areas and it remains small largely because of the limitations in existing technologies. The end users and solution providers still seek a compact, easy-to-use, and intuitive solution. This project will significantly enhance our understanding of wireless 3D motion tracking and its application to man-machine interface technology, resulting in an easy-to-use, fast and accurate 3D user interface device. As the mouse completely changed the way man and computer have connected over the last several decades, an easy-to-use, intuitive, and natural 3D man-computer interaction device will have great impact in the way we relate to computers/machines, resulting in a significant commercial impact in a broad range of application areas. This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will develop a wireless magnetic beacon-based 3D position sensor and its application to a 3D man-computer user interface. Existing 3D position tracking solutions for applications requiring 3D man-machine interaction utilize optical video sensors, infrared sensors, inertial sensors, ultrasound sensors or bending sensors. Despite recent progress, various fundamental challenges remain, including a line-of-sight requirement and the lack of haptic-feedback when using optical sensing, and the drift issue for inertial sensing. The proposed technology utilizes a magnetic beacon signal, and the unique characteristics of the proposed 3D user interface device include non-line-of-sight capability, absolute position and orientation tracking without drift, haptic feedback capability, low computational load, high accuracy, and high read speed. Anticipated applications include input devices for CAD design, digital art, 3D medical imaging systems handling 3D MRI, CT, and inner organ images, and educational devices requiring 3D interaction. The developed 3D device will significantly improve the work productivity of end users through its compact size and intuitive way of use. It will also provide a new opportunity for application developers to build cost-effective yet powerful 3D interaction-based design, educational, instructional and training apps."

There is a critical need to develop sampling methods for PFAS to assess risks and inform remedial investigations and feasibility studies (RI/FS) at locations where historical releases have elevated concentrations in soils and sediments. Passive sampling methods provide an indirect approach for assessing risks associated with bioaccumulative compounds such as PFAS. There is a need to develop standardized approaches for PFAS analysis in soils and sediments using passive samplers. The technology could be used in the RI/FS process to evaluate various remedial alternatives. Military bases are a major potential customer for the technology, as the Department of Defense has estimated that legacy releases of PFAS represent a $2 billion liability. Landfills where PFAS have been disposed of in the past are another potential customer. The market is estimated in excess of $1 billion. Passive samplers provide a direct measure of potential bioaccumulation risks unlike methods such as solvent extraction that are needed to minimize the costs associated with environmental remediation because they measure the freely dissolved concentration that is available for bioaccumulation."

PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Bladder cancer is the fth most common cancer in the United States and one key challenge for bladder cancer
is the high recurrence rate after initial treatment Furthermore a number of medical and environmental
conditions are associated with higher incidence of bladder cancer Therefore regular surveillance of bladder
cancer is critical in subpopulations to detect disease early prevent relapse and progression and improve
overall survival The current gold standard of bladder cancer detection is cystoscopy which is invasive and
expensive Existing urine based testing methods for bladder cancer have not been widely adopted in clinical
practices either due to low test sensitivity and speci city conventional cytology ELISA  or technical
complexities long turn around time and high cost RT qPCR sequencing
To address these challenges Accure Health proposes to commercialize a non invasive fast affordable and
highly accurate diagnostic platform based on integrated magneto electronic sensing iMES of urine exosomes
 or extracellular vesicles EVs  EVs have emerged as a new class of biomarker for cancer management
detectable in urine circulation and other body uids These secreted vesicles carry molecular information from
their originating cells and capturing this information can provide a representative real time window to
monitor tumor burden  A variety of EV biomarkers have been investigated to speci cally detect tumor
originating EV  One critical unmet need to harness the translational potential of EV is to develop more
integrated highly sensitive and easy to use clinical systems since puri cation and conventional analytics are
often too complex time consuming and expensive In preliminary work we have developed and validated the
easy to use and sensitive iMES technology which seems ideally suited for point of care diagnostics for
bladder cancer We now propose to further improve the user interface miniaturize the sensor for
commercialization and perform correlative benchmarking measurements against accepted gold standards We
also plan to develop several smart diagnostic modules including smart device communication and cloud
based data management We believe that by connecting patients and doctors through smart devices and
cloud based resources patient care and disease management can be signi cantly improved
This Phase I proposal will focus on two speci c Aims  i Develop a smart iMES platform for rapid and
sensitive urine biomarker analysis and ii apply the new iMES platform to screen urinary EVs for bladder
cancer detection Successful completion of this Phase I project will result in a product prototype ready for direct
analyses of urine samples from bladder cancer patients During a subsequent Phase II we will perform clinical
testing with key partners The smart features together with non invasiveness high sensitivity and low cost of
this system will allow Accure Health to be in a position to le for Investigational Device Exemption by the end of
Phase II which will further strengthen our competitive advantages and value proposition PROJECT NARRATIVE
We will develop a new diagnostic platform based on integrated magneto electronic sensing iMES of urine
exosomes or extracellular vesicles EVs  By integrating miniaturized biosensor technologies and digital
healthcare solutions this smart iMES platform will enable non invasive fast affordable and highly accurate

Treatment of Onychomycosis Utilizing Targeted, Controlled High-Frequency EnergyPIs: Laura King and Dan van der Weide
The painful and disfiguring fungal infection of the nail, known as onychomycosis, afflicts over 5% of the
global population and accounts for 50% of all nail disorders. Not simply a cosmetic disease,
onychomycosis is an intractable infection strongly intertwined with diabetes, as diabetic patients are
more likely to be susceptible to this fungal infection and those who are infected are more likely to develop
serious issues such as foot ulcers, secondary infections, peripheral neuropathy, and even amputation. A
substantial, unmet clinical need for safe, effective treatment of onychomycosis exists because current
therapies are minimally effective, require daily application, and have significant potential risks. A new
therapeutic modality, heating through delivery of High Frequency Energy (HFE), is already successfully
treating patients with cancer by killing the offending cells and sparing adjacent tissue through cooling
mechanisms. Building upon our previous innovations in HFE, this same technology at much lower
powers can be used to treat infections like onychomycosis. Treatment with HFE, as developed with
attention to patient-specific time and dose delivery provided by clinicians in their offices, can provide the
safe, effective, and efficiently delivered treatment for millions of patients with this challenging, often
painful condition and limit its sequelae. In this proposal, Aim 1 will model a range of treatment zone
temperatures (47oâ50oC) at the simulated nail bed using HFE power and time schedules consistent with
clinical treatment (e.g. 5â10 W for 5â30 minutes), and to optimize the placement and orientation of the
HFE relative to the infected nail bed. Careful modulation of the treatment times and temperatures will
avoid second and third degree burns and spare the nail from damage, while eliminating fungal growth. In
Aim 2, an in vitro model of fungal infection will be utilized to demonstrate the ability to inhibit growth of
dermatophytes utilizing time and power algorithms guided by the predictive models developed in Aim 1.
Using the HFE algorithms and our applicator design, Aim 3 will test the ability of HFE to eliminate
dermatophyte growth supported on cadaver nails with a goal of 100% elimination of fungal growth. The
computational model will be further refined with the resulting data from this human nail model to optimize
the time and temperature algorithm. After further development in a potential Phase II grant, the ultimate
goal will be to develop and build a functional prototype based on these results, capable of delivering
controlled HFE to the nail bed for repeatable treatment of onychomycosis, to be used in the physicianâs
office or point-of-care dermatology clinics.Project Relevance
Treatment of Onychomycosis Utilizing Targeted, Controlled High-Frequency EnergyPIs: Laura King and Dan van der Weide
Onychomycosis is a widespread and often painful infection of the nail, nail bed, and/or nail matrix caused by
a prevalent fungal organism, leading to deformed/detached nails, susceptibility to infection, and for diabetic
patients an increased incidence of diabetic foot ulcers. Currently available oral and topical medications are
plagued by low cure rates or deleterious side effects, and in the United States alone, $1.2B is spent annually
on largely ineffective treatments for onychomycosis. In this proposal, we will develop a technology to deliver
high frequency energy with targeted precision to the site of fungal infection and eliminate fungal growth in a
nail model system, with ultimate plans to develop a device for patient treatment in the physicianandapos;s office."

Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with a very low (8%) 5-year survival rate. Therapeutic options are
limited in efficacy and many have substantial toxicity. Targeted drug delivery may improve the therapeutic
index of cancer drugs by enhancing drug localization to the cancer cell while minimizing off-target side effects.
Sigma-2 receptors (S2R) are highly expressed in pancreatic and other cancers compared to healthy cells.
Accuronix Therapeutics is developing ACXT-3102, a molecule with therapeutic potential licensed from
Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSM). ACXT-3102 is comprised of a S2 ligand
covalently bound to the ferroptosis-inducing molecule dm-erastin. Preliminary data show that ACXT-3102
increased the cytotoxicity against pancreatic tumor cells in vitro by 35-fold compared to dm-erastin alone.
ACXT-3102 has tremendous potential as a novel treatment option for pancreatic and perhaps several other
types of cancer. Drug optimization strategies were conducted in a Phase I STTR which resulted in a better
yield during drug synthesis, identification of a mesylate salt with high aqueous solubility and improved physical
properties suitable for oral drug administration, demonstration of good oral efficacy and discovery that tumors
lacking malic enzyme 1 (ME1) are even more sensitive to ACXT-3102.
For this Phase II STTR program, Accuronix Therapeutics will continue to work with our research colleagues
from WUSM to prepare ACXT-3102 for Investigational New Drug (IND) submission and eventually testing the
compound in pancreatic cancer patients. We will conduct a series of preclinical studies to optimize the dosing
regimen in murine pancreatic cancer models â understanding if once, twice or three times per day drug
administration improves plasma exposure and anti-tumor efficacy while maintaining safety, i.e., avoiding dose-
limiting side effects. Studies will also explore if efficacy of our drug can be further improved when given in
combination with gemcitabine, a current standard-of-care for pancreatic cancer. Chemical and metabolic
stability of ACXT-3102 will be established using in vitro assays to guide storage conditions of the drug and
understand which preclinical species best represents metabolism in humans. To obtain data required for the
pharmacology and safety sections of the IND package, preclinical studies will be conducted according to Good
Laboratory Practice (GLP) guidelines to generate pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data for
correlating plasma exposures in different species to what is predicted in human. Similarly, formal GLP
toxicology studies will be completed using three different doses in rats and dogs to establish the âNo Observed
Adverse Effect Levelâ (NOAEL). These data will be used to model exposure levels in humans and establish a
safe, first-in-human (FIH) dose for starting our clinical trials in cancer patients. At the conclusion of the Phase
II STTR grant, we will have the pharmacology and safety information on ACXT-3102 required for the IND
package, and will have established the first dose to be used in patients.Project Narrative
The primary goal of this Phase II STTR application is to develop ACXT-3102 as an improved therapeutic for
the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Selectively targeted cancer drugs hold great promise to increase
therapeutic efficacy while minimizing putative off-site toxicities, i.e. improving tolerability. Successful
conclusion of this program will be judged by having 1) established the optimal doses and dosing schedule
required for good efficacy in cancer models, 2) determined how to store the drug without losing activity, 3)
generated critical pharmacology and safety data required by the FDA to submit for starting clinical trials, and 4)
predicted a safe initial dose to start treating cancer patients in the first clinical trial with ACXT-3102."

One prominent scattering technique is neutron reflectometry, which is routinely used to non- destructively measure the depth profile of thin film materials. Unfortunately, these measurements are complicated, and interpretation can be challenging as complex mathematical modeling is required to correlate the data to meaningful metrics. Despite the criticality of this modeling, the relative rarity of neutron sources has hindered the maturation of modeling software packages used to interpret neutron data. While powerful, current modeling software suffers from a lack of mature graphic user interface and other User Interface/User Experience tools that would make it more accessible to both neutron scientists at large and the broader scientific community. While the value of modern modeling tools cannot be understated, a lack of a mature, usable interface and installation package means many users find it difficult if not impossible to utilize without prior knowledge of setting up a software environment or utilizing a command line interface. In this SBIR Phase I, a robust open-source graphical user interface will be developed in the Python programming language around the Refl1D base code. This user interface will be designed to streamline the modeling process, while clearly exposing all the tools and features the software has to offer. The package will also include in-software documentation that will lead users through the tool sets available. Once developed, it will be packaged for use with Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms, further extending the accessibility of the software and increasing the chances of widespread user adoption. The single-click installer will eliminate the need for users to configure their Python interpreter and libraries to conform to the needs of Refl1D. Finally, the application will be hosted on an open source platform in order to enable quick accessibility and user feedback. One of the primary focuses of this work is to emphasize the features that are of most value to the neutron reflectometry user. First, a data reduction panel will be developed so that users can import, aggregate, process, and normalize the data. Once the data is reduced, it can be modeled in a ""model development"" panel. This panel will provide several features critical to data analysis, including model building, fit parameter development, fit method selection and local/remote processing. The panel will then provide real-time feedback to the user as the modeling process is carried out.

Subsurface water is heavily affected by changes in the environment and its quality is regarded as a powerful metric for evaluating the health of the subsurface environment. Therefore, constant monitoring of groundwater quality to identify influences over the seasonal hydrologic cycle, can be a reliable means for ensuring a secure and safe environment. Detrimental influences may include the discharge of toxic chemicals from industry, nitrate and pesticide contamination, nutrient depletion and atmospheric transport of pollutants into the subsurface. In addition, for water safety purposes, the monitoring of groundwater contaminants is of great importance. Most of the methods used to monitor groundwater quality require manual sample collection, laboratory based metrology systems and skilled personnel. These factors make groundwater monitoring expensive to perform and delay the response time in the case of a major contamination events. Thus, there is an urgent need for a field deployable, self- powered continuous detection system that can provide laboratory-scale characterization on the field without the need of constant human oversight. In this project an integrated monitoring system will be developed for characterizing groundwater quality, allowing installation and autonomous operation in the field for prolonged periods of time. The team will perform the necessary research to develop a prototype system using miniature monochromators, spectrometers and optical detectors operating on a power budget suitable for solar and battery power supply. The groundwater sample will be illuminated by sweeping monochromatic light and the spectral fluorescence, scattering and transmission of the sample will be measured versus the illuminating wavelength. The work will focus on implementing excitation emission matrix spectroscopy, traditional optical spectroscopy and turbidity measurement. Excitation emission matrix spectroscopy is a powerful tool for detecting and characterizing dissolved organic matter by its fluorescence response in natural water systems. The broadband spectral transmission and turbidity measurements will ensure detection of other organic and inorganic compounds and larger particles. The system will include water sampling via a commercially available groundwater sampling system, which allows the sampling of groundwater at different subsurface depths. It will also include remote installation and data collection to perform groundwater monitoring without human oversight. No similar commercial system is currently available. During Phase I the individual characterization techniques will be tested in laboratory environment and an integrated prototype system will be build.

It has the potential to make a significant impact on energy utilization and become a critical component to making thin film processes cost effective, leading to waste-free manufacturing.
Thin film deposition processes are extensively used in man-critical industries with significant national importance: Â semiconductors, solar cells, optics, displays, telecom, medical, biological, and military. Many of these processes are inefficient, resulting in low manufacturing yield and higher material and energy consumption. The existing process and product control systems typically control the quality of the products <em>post-factum</em>. Significant portions of manufactured products fail to meet product specification and are rejected, inflating the product cost and creating environmental pollution. Billions of dollars and energy are wasted annually due to manufacturing inefficiency, contributing to global climate issues.
Under this SBIR Phase I project, AccuStrata will develop an algorithm and a software program as part of a real-time intelligent optical control system that will improve the quality of thin film products, reduce their cost, and reduce energy consumption and environmental pollution.
This project specifically targets the thin film solar cell industry, which is the most rapidly growing solar industry. The proposed development will increase the conversion efficiency of thin film solar panels, resulting in lower cost, increased solar technology adoption, reduced carbon emissions, and reduced dependency on foreign oil.
AccuStrataâs system measures the optical properties of layers as they are being deposited on a panel in real time as the panel moves throughout the manufacturing line. The measurements are performed seamlessly by miniature fiber optic sensors installed at specific locations in the production line. The proposed software acquires the measured data from the sensors, compares them with the target performance, provides real-time data analysis, and generates messages and corrective actions for each solar panel. As a result, the manufacturing process can be changed to adapt to the actual conditions on the panel under deposition and ensure that each panel will be corrected in real time to meet its product specification.
During Phase I, AccuStrata will develop the software and validate it in a solar cell manufacturerâs facility. In a later development, the system will be incorporated into the product line to take automatic corrective actions without human involvement."

This proposal will reduce waste and improve the manufacturing yield and the conversion efficiency of thin film solar cells and panels. It has specific benefits for the large-size solar panels, which are manufactured at higher cost today due to insufficient manufacturing yield. The proposed technology will reduce the time it takes for solar panels to reach grid parity with traditional energy sources. The proposed technology will also facilitate the development of numerous other applications for next generation thin film based products such as photonic crystals, nanotechnology, meta-materials, multi-junction solar cells, printing and counterfeiting control.

Among these critical pathways, various receptor tyrosine kinases, sonic hedgehog, transforming growth factor beta, Notch and WNT are known or suspected mediators of the effect of numerous environmental toxicants produced during manufacturing, present in the air and water supply. The interconnected nature of these pathways, and finely-tuned spatial and temporal regulation, make them simultaneously broad targets for impactful environmental pollutants and challenging to efficiently model in the laboratory.Â§Previously, direct modeling of the effect of environmental toxicants on critical developmental and physiological pathways in a comprehensive or holistic manner involved the use of animal models which are expensive, labor-intensive, time consuming, low throughput, and may not always be highly predictive of human responses. Many of these key developmental pathways overlap with targets of modern oncology drug discovery effort, due to their misregulation in many cancers. A multitude of sophisticated, high-throughput assays and technologies focused on the identification of modulators of these pathways have been developed and marketed for drug discovery applications of the last decade. Among these, label-free cell-based assays provide an opportunity to assess the impact of toxicants on biological pathways in a relatively holistic and biologically relevant context compared to traditional HTS assays. While label-free, cell-based approaches to assessment of pathway modulators lack the ability to detect tissue and organism-level effects, they have proven to be predictive of toxicity and efficacy of small molecule drugs in the clinic, in part due to the choice of biologically relevant human cell lines matching the biological context of the pathways being assayed. Â§This project will help us to research and develop for eventual commercialization a panel of validated cell lines, protocols, and data analysis methods to assess toxic effects of molecules on the critical developmental pathways outlined above on existing, commercially available high throughput label-free screening systems. The first phase consists of initial feasibility studies using receptor tyrosine kinase pathways to broadly assess which pathways can potentially be interrogated, and for each, what toxicantclasses may be detected. The optimization of product design and production techniques for stable scale-up will be conducted, followed by assay optimization for each pathway-specific product. Finally, assay miniaturization, testing under HTS automation workflows, development and validation of dataanalysis parameters, and preliminary validation of assay selectivity will be conducted to generate a product suitable of commercialization."

 Alzheimer s disease AD is characterized by hyperphosphorylated tau protein which causes impaired
axonal transport in neurons In recent years multiple researchers have determined that oxidative stress
appears to be a significant early event in the pathogenesis of AD in preclinical AD models and in AD patients
We have shown that reducing oxidative stress through quenching of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species
 ROS results in significant improvements in AD pathology in mice Unfortunately targeting oxidative stress to
date has not been efficacious clinically in mitigating AD pathology Dietary antioxidants are low potency
require high doses are potentially toxic at those doses and have not proven clinically effective There is thus
an urgent clinical need to develop potent stable intracellular antioxidants for the treatment of AD
 Polyethylene glycol PEG conjugated hydrophilic carbon clusters PEG HCCs are novel nanoparticle
antioxidants that convert superoxide to O faster than many single active site catalysts These are also stable
soluble and non toxic at moderately high concentrations We have shown that PEG HCCs enter cells and
preferentially accumulate at or near mitochondria We hypothesize that PEG HCCs inhibit action of IL  via
ROS quenching which then prevents increased activity of p  and cdk  resulting in a normalization of
hyperphosphorylated tau and a reduction in AD pathology The PEG HCC technology has been awarded
multiple patents Acelerox has obtained the international license to the relevant patents for all fields of use and
is set to fully explore and develop the unique properties of this novel nanomaterial in treating Alzheimer s
disease
 In this proposal we seek to conduct key animal experiments to establish proof of principle of this novel
therapy in animal models of AD In Aimwe will Investigate repeated intranasal administration as a potential
route of delivery of PEG HCCs In Aimwe will perform a proof of concept experiment to establish efficacy of
PEG HCC in mouse model of tauopathy
 In summary we will evaluate a novel class of nano antioxidants the PEG HCCs to effectively reduce
ROS in a tau model of AD We are in the unique position to use these highly active bioavailable and selective
antioxidant nanomaterials to test the hypothesis that oxidative stress is a viable therapeutic option in treating
AD and also begin to assess the mechanisms of improvement in a pre clinical system The extensive data
generated using these nanoparticles suggest that they are taken up by cells and targeted to mitochondria the
primary source of antioxidants and appear to be well tolerated NARRATIVE
Recent research has revealed that the pathology of Alzheimer s disease AD is strongly associated with
overproduction of intracellular toxic oxygen species resulting is an urgent clinical search for a potent and
selective antioxidant drug We have recently developed a highly potent nontoxic and stable nanoparticle
antioxidant which has shown promise in mice models of AD Here we propose to perform pivotal proof of
concept experiments to demonstrate efficacy of this novel therapeutic approach in animal models of AD and
explore clinically relevant dosage routes"

ASDs are one of the most common forms of congenital heart disease and account for approximately 30-40% of all congenital heart defects seen in adults. Closure of an ASD can be performed either surgically or percutaneously, and the success rate of this procedure is very high. However, recent reports suggest that complications with severe hemodynamic consequences do occur and are a result of the metal cage configuration of the repair device. This cage configuration serves as an abrasive surface to adjacent atrial roof and aortic tissues. The proposed studies would utilize non-abrasive, naturally occurring ECM configured in mechanically-appropriate, multilaminate form as the repair device. This Phase I proposal has three Specific Aims. The first Specific Aim would develop a prototype ECM device suitable for percutaneous delivery. The second Specific Aim would evaluate the biomechanical and biophysical properties of the device. The final Specific Aim would determine functionality in a pig model of surgically created ASD. These studies will be conducted by an experienced team of investigators at ACell, Inc., with a subcontract for the animal studies at the Center for Preclinical Studies within the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. Clearly defined criteria for success are identified for each Specific Aim and a timeline for completion of the studies is provided."

 bladder-extracellular matrix (UBM-ECM) for the repair of diseased mucogingival
 tissue. Cells harvested from either attached gingiva or buccal mucosa will be
 used to seed either of these substrates and the resulting engineered tissue
 will ultimately be tested for their histogenic potential in the appropriate
 mucosal sites in dogs. Since the state of hydration of the substrate may be a
 factor in the potential for cellular differentiation and proliferation, an
 initial study will be done to test the hydrated state versus the freeze dried
 state in this regard. The strength of the final tissue engineered product will
 be mechanically tested for its ultimate suture strength prior to implantation

"ACELL, INC.",A Bioscaffold for Repair of Congenital Defects,Department of Health and Human Services,National Institutes of Health,Phase I,SBIR,1R43DK059686-01,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2001,"$100,000.00",N/A,No,No,No,N/A,,6 OLD DEE RD,,CAMBRIDGE,MA,02138,,,(617) 547-9060,,ALAN SPIEVACK,,() -,,,,,,"DESCRIPTION (Verbatim from the Applicant&#039;s Abstract): This Phase I SBIR
 application seeks support to develop and evaluate a naturally-occurring
 extracellular matrix (ECM) bioscaffold material for tissue engineering
 applications; specifically, the repair and/or restoration of congenital defects
 in which lost or missing tissue is the limiting factor for surgical
 reconstruction. Porcine derived ECM harvested from the urinary bladder (UBM)
 represents a cellular biodegradable scaffold material that supports cell
 attachment, migration, proliferation and differentiation, and wound healing.
 Processed single sheets of UBM and other ECMs have shown excellent remodeling
 capabilities in both pre clinical animal studies and early human clinical
 studies. With SBIR Phase I support, we propose to develop a multilaminate sheet
 form of UBM with the appropriate mechanical and biologic properties that allow
 for post surgical tissue growth and thus obviate the need for repeat surgeries
 as the patient matures. An experimentally-created diaphragmatic hernia will be
 used as the model of a congenital defect. There are three specific aims. First,
 we will determine the manufacturing method required to develop a prototype
 multilaminate UBM device with the mechanical strength that exceeds by a factor
 of 2 the normal mammalian diaphragm. Secondly, we will evaluate the effect of
 two different methods of sterilization, gamma irradiation and ethylene oxide,
 upon the mechanical strength of the prototype UBM device. The third specific
 aim will evaluate the utility of the sterilized multilaminate UBM device in a
 dog pilot study in which an experimentally-created diaphragmatic hernia will be
 repaired in 10-weekold dogs and evaluated over time until the point of physical
 maturity. Currently, there are limited options for the surgical
 repair/reconstruction of body structures that require surgical repair as a
 result of congenital abnormalities. The proposed studies are critical in the
 decision-making process of determining whether or not to pursue development of
 this product. Each objective/specific aim has well-defined criteria for
 success, and the proposed studies will be conducted by an experienced and
 knowledgeable tissue engineering research team. A time line for the proposed
 work is provided, and the technology involves an innovative tissue engineering
 approach in a medical field with significant unmet needs.
 PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:
 The use of UBM-ECM for the tissue engineering applications that involve the restoration
 of missing tissue as a result of congenital anomalies is in many ways an orphan market.
 Most biomaterials currently available for such use are inadequate beause they do not
 ""grow"" as the infant grows and, thus, repeat surgical procedures are required. Many
 currently available materials result in scar tissue formation with extensive morbidity. The
 development of new materials for these applications is not cost effective for many large
 companies due to the relatively small number of patients requiring this material each year.
 However, these patients desperately need a better alternative to existing materials, and
 successful development of this product could lead to broader surgical applications."

 end-stage renal disease they must undergo either dialysis or transplantation.
 About 200,000 Americans need artificial kidney machines to stay alive. These
 machines rely on sterile dialysis membranes to remove toxic materials from the
 bloodstream. More than 30 different polymers or polymer blends are used in
 dialysis membranes, and most of these degrade under conditions of steam or
 gamma radiation sterilization. Ethylene oxide (EO) remains the sterilant of
 choice for these membranes. However, the traditional blend used 88 percent
 CFC-12 as a fire suppressant and propellant, and CFCs have been phased out of
 production because of their high ozone-depletion potentials (ODPs).
 Alternatives include explosive 100 percent EO and blends of EO with high global
 warming potential (GWP) hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), less effective carbon
 dioxide, or hydro chlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) compounds facing future phase out.
 This proposed Phase I effort wilt determine the feasibility of using blends
 containing EO, trifluoromethyl iodide (CF3I), and HFCs for sterilizing dialysis
 membranes. Trifluoromethyl iodide is an excellent combustion suppressant and
 has physical properties similar to CFC-12 with zero ODP and extremely low GWP.
 Flammability and fractionation tests will be conducted to determine optimal
 blend compositions. Compatibility and residual CF3I measurements with common
 membrane materials will be conducted.
 PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:
 The research, if successful, will develop a new nonflammable sterilant gas for dialysis
 membranes that does not contain ozone-depleting substances, is more effective that
 current alternatives, and has reduced GWP. The new sterilant gas should also be useful
 for sterilizing many other types of medical equipment. The new sterilant gas should be
 marketable worldwide and should allow use of existing EO sterilizing equipment, thus
 reducing costs of medical care."

Economic factors drive the need to keep these vehicles in-service for longer periods of time, often well beyond their designed service life. As these structures age, there is an increasing need for inspection to ensure public safety, ensure combat readiness and schedule maintenance effectively. The high cost of owning and operating these systems provides incentives for enhancing the means of evaluating and monitoring their structural integrity. The big challenge to this industry is that it must maintain a high standard of safety with its fleet in an economic environment with cost-effectiveness that is intensely competitive. With the growing number of older aircraft in service, the business case for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) retrofit applications is increasingly gaining more and more momentum. Retrofit applications focused on monitoring age-related degradation parameters like fatigue, corrosion and delamination are a key target of SHM. The target SHM technology is lightweight, easy to install and simple to use. The emphasis is not only on the development of further new SHM technologies, but also on testing the SHM systems robustness in representative environments to mature future service applications. The proposed system could potentially lead to significant savings in maintenance costs for aircraft (30-90% depending on application), can enhance the reliability of the structures and improve their efficiency, safety, and readiness. The proposed innovative, integrated inspection system, can efficiently and economically manage structural inspection data for the fleets of aging U.S. Air Force aircraft. The proposed work will be conducted in close collaboration with companies such as Boeing to ensure that this work will be directly beneficial to them."

BENEFIT: Anticipated Benefits: The innovation of the proposed system has many advantages: 1) Increased safety, reliability and robust in-situ health monitoring (early warning system) 2) Complete damage information V both qualitative and quantitative characterization 3) Reduced inspections and reduced vehicle downtime 4) Maximized lifespan of structures residual life estimate by prognosis. Potential Commercial Applications: The technology and system that will be developed in Phase II will serve the interest of not only the aerospace industry but other industries as well that use composite materials including the automotive, shipping, railway and wind turbine manufacturing industries. Automobile bodies, offshore structures, wind turbine blades and railway coach components are prone to frequent mechanical wear and tear due to the environmental, transportational and operational effects under which they need to function. This technology will completely revolutionize the way in which structural diagnosis is performed in these industries and provide a state-of-the-art solution for maintenance and support. This technology will prove very useful for the different industries listed above and serve the needs for maintenance and support for all future generation aircrafts and different composite structures.

Many of these missiles are intended to sit idly in storage for extended periods and then are required to function flawlessly. However, SRMs are subject to a variety of unexpected environmental and loading conditions from the time-of-manufacturing to launch, and these conditions can significantly impact the performance and reliability of the motor. In addition, aging of the materials can cause significant property changes, leading to bondline degradation and changes in the propellant strain field, which can result in anomalous burning behavior when the motor is fired. An accurate assessment of the current state of an SRM, and prediction of the future state, is critically needed to ensure the viability of each asset and maintain a healthy missile fleet. Acellent Technologies is currently developing structural health monitoring systems to address these issues. The proposed program focuses on innovations to develop a complete integrated system that can monitor the health of the SRM from cradle-to-grave. The goal of the program will be to develop the system for deployment on operational motors. The development will be conducted in close collaboration with ATK-Thiokol who fully supports the developmental efforts. BENEFIT: The proposed diagnostic system for solid rocket motor health and process mishap monitoring allows for early warning of structural and propellant damage, errant structural behavior, or material degradation detection throughout involved handling, transportation, and testing processes. The largest and nearest-term impact areas for the technology are mission critical COPV structures used in aerospace structures. Economic and political factors drive the need to keep these structures in-service for longer periods of time, often well beyond their designed service life. As these structures age, there is an increasing need for inspection to ensure public safety and schedule maintenance effectively. The high cost of owning and operating these systems provides incentives for enhancing the means of evaluating and monitoring their structural integrity. The proposed work will be conducted in close collaboration with the rocket motor industries (such as ATK Thiokol) to ensure that this research will be directly beneficial to them. Acellent is currently working with other industries such as aeronautics, automobile, off-shore and ground vehicles to enable utilization of mass-production techniques to provide high quality sensing technologies at lower costs to the individual users. Once developed, the system will be available independently or in a complete package along with the monitoring layer, software and hardware. The plug-and-play feature of the system will make it ready to use for any practical application."

These result in unsteady, alternating impacts that can damage exposed surfaces. It is important to track the cumulative stresses imposed on the fairing panels to provide operators with a sense of the remaining service life of the panels. Fairing Panel failure could be catastrophic to operations. Since surface mounted sensors can become damaged or dislodged during normal operational use, there is a need to develop a reliable, durable embedded sensor system. In order to be able to make accurate measurements from embedded sensors, these challenges must be dealt with: (1) Sensor movement during the manufacture of composite, (2) Survivability to high temperature/high pressure composite manufacturing environments, (3) Compatibility of composite materials and sensors, and (4) Ability to make âmeasurement calibrationsâ to compensate for the effect of 3-D stresses. In this proposal, Acellent will address and overcome all of the major challenges faced for embedding stress/strain sensors within Fairing Panel composites. Acellentâs unique ""SMART Layer"" technology has been demonstrated to securely embed sensors, keeping them from moving, during the cure of composites. This advanced technical ability will be used as a basis for this development."

The resulting field of Cheminformatics has blossomed in recent years and has been a hotbed for the application of data mining and database principles to collections of chemical compounds. The wide adoption of these techniques has led to im- proved methods for representation of chemical structures, similarity-based retrieval of chemical compounds, diversity analysis, and substructure mining. The representation of chemical compounds as graphs captures the essential aspects of chemical structures in a natural way that can be communicated easily. Recent techniques for graph querying and mining have demonstrated great promise for scalability as well as an improved quality of results over traditional representation techniques such as fingerprints. These techniques include novel ways of graph matching, the organization of graphs in a hierarchical index structure, and the mining of a set of graphs to find statistically over-represented motifs. The proposed research will develop computational tools based on these ideas and investigate the feasibility of the techniques on diverse and large data sets. Graph-based techniques for similar compound retrieval, diversity analysis, and substructure mining will be compared to competing techniques based on other representations of chemical structures. Finally, a system that integrates chemical compound databases with biological databases will be developed. The resulting analysis methods are expected to make a significant impact on the complex, time-consuming, and expensive process of drug discovery. Graph-based representation of chemical compounds results in a more accurate realization of the chemical space. The use of recent techniques in graph querying and mining will enable data analysis that can scale to millions of compounds. The developed system will also integrate information on chemical compounds with biological activity and protein interaction networks, thus enabling more efficient drug discovery."

We propose to develop software for integrating and understanding protein-protein interactions, a fundamental problem in biology. A set of tools will be developed for constructing large-scale probabilistic networks of protein interactions using data sources such as microarrays, bioimages, GO annotations, genomic data, literature, and experimental data. The techniques will be based on Bayesian networks (BN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and will be made scalable to large datasets. The second goal is to develop tools for analyzing interaction networks for pathway discovery, motif finding, and function identification. These tools will be based on current research in the areas of graph algorithms, bioinformatics, machine learning, and databases. We will target two model organisms: S. cerevisiae (yeast) and C. elegans (worm). The quality of the constructed networks will be evaluated with known protein interactions for these species. Scalability tests will be performed with the worm interactome that is about ten times larger than the yeast interactome. The developed tools will be compatible with current standards and integrated into a database backend. The resulting software will enable assimilation of heterogeneous biological data with the ultimate goal of increased understanding of fundamental processes in molecular biology. The goal of this Phase I project is to prove the feasibility of constructing and analyzing probabilistic protein interaction networks in a scalable manner using new algorithms. The integration of diverse data sources such as microarrays, genomics, literature, and high-throughput experiments into pathways will facilitate the study the biological processes behind human diseases. The understanding of protein interactions within a pathway and interactions between pathways will lead to the selection of appropriate targets for therapeutic intervention, and eventually to cheaper and faster drug discovery."

Due to limitations in replicating hypersonic test conditions on the ground, wind tunnel data are augmented with flight tests to calibrate current computer models and provide data for developing improved physics based models used in hypersonic system design. While significant advances have been made in the last decade under Air Force and complementary DARPA, ONR and NASA efforts, a full spectrum of research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) activities is still required in a number of hypersonic disciplines to provide the full promise of these advanced capabilities.In most previous hypersonic flight programs, the flight test article was designed to be recovered after the flight test - only telemetry data was obtained - thus post flight inspections were not performed.If recovery had occurred, it could have provided valuable insights about the airframe and engine material/structural systems performance, scramjet engine operation, subsystem condition, and instrumentation requirements/optimal locations, as well as potentially providing advanced warning of potential system failures on subsequent flights.New methods to enable reliable and cost effective recovery and even reuse of hypersonic flight test articles would reduce risk, improve execution efficiency, and enhance vehicle design evolution. These recovery technologies would directly support DoD hypersonic technology maturation and demonstration, as well as T&E of weapon systems, and space vehicles by improved validation and verification of the system under test."

Our modular low cost flight test technique will permit developers of hypersonic propulsion systems to flight test their vehicle and/or engine in sub-scale early in the developmental cycle to assess thrust and operability performance among other things. In a synergistic application with computational simulations and ground testing, this crucial flight data will provide a clear path to full-scale flight testing and development with reduced risk and cost.

We propose to use the hydrolysis of nonpyrophoric dilute TEA/JP fuel mixtures in an integrated mixing/injection apparatus to heat and vaporize liquid hydrocarbon fuel to enable cold-start capability in regeneratively cooled scramjets. In addition, the hydrolysis reaction also produces ethane gas, which serves the dual purpose of atomizing any remaining liquid by effervescence as well as producing an ethane-rich injectant that is more readily ignitable than the vaporized JP fuel. Furthermore, since TEA is pyrophoric, any remaining TEA in the mixture could serve as an ignition aid once it comes in contact with air. Hence, through a straightforward hydrolysis mechanism, the proposed system would preheat and vaporize the fuel, atomize any remaining liquid through effervescence, add readily ignitable ethane to the mixture, and provide a potential ignition source with any TEA leftover from the hydrolysis reaction.

The economic burden of depression alone is immense. Of the $83.1 billion spent in 2000 on the treatment of depression and related expenses, $26.1 billion (31 percent) were direct medical costs, $5.4 billion (7 percent) were suicide-related mortality costs, and $51.5 billion (62 percent) were workplace costs. Major depressive disorder is the leading cause of disability in the U.S. and other established market economies worldwide. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging has become a powerful tool in mapping the distribution of proteins targeted by selectively binding radioligands in the healthy and diseased brain. As there is a growing body of evidence supporting norepinephrine&#039;s involvement in brain-related disorders such as depression, we have a unique opportunity to advance improved PET ligands targeted to the norepinephrine transporter (NET). The studies described in this research proposal are based upon preliminary and SAR data in-hand and involve the design and synthesis of improved NET- selective ligands, as well as the in vitro and in vivo testing of these compounds as PET imaging agents. Within the context of this grant, it is our intention to follow up on our exciting preliminary findings by conducting the following studies:
1. Using our best NET-selective lead structures, we will design and synthesize 15 new ligands for biological assay of monoamine transporter inhibitory activity.
2. Ligands with subnanomolar potency will be considered for radiolabeling, and suitable precursors will be prepared.

The economic burden of depression alone is immense. Of the $83.1 billion spent in 2000 on the treatment of depression and related expenses, $26.1 billion (31 percent) were direct medical costs, $5.4 billion (7 percent) were suicide-related mortality costs, and $51.5 billion (62 percent) were workplace costs. Major depressive disorder is the leading cause of disability in the U.S. and other established market economies worldwide. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging has become a powerful tool in mapping the distribution of proteins targeted by selectively binding radioligands in the healthy and diseased brain. As there is a growing body of evidence supporting norepinephrine's involvement in brain-related disorders such as depression, we have a unique opportunity to advance improved PET ligands targeted to the norepinephrine transporter (NET). The studies described in this research proposal are based upon preliminary and SAR data in-hand and involve the design and synthesis of improved NET- selective ligands, as well as the in vitro and in vivo testing of these compounds as PET imaging agents. Within the context of this grant, it is our intention to follow up on our exciting preliminary findings by conducting the following studies: 1. Using our best NET-selective lead structures, we will design and synthesize 15 new ligands for biological assay of monoamine transporter inhibitory activity. 2. Ligands with subnanomolar potency will be considered for radiolabeling, and suitable precursors will be prepared. 3. PET studies on radiolabeled compounds to investigate their pharmacokinetic properties as imaging agents will be carried out. 4.

Apoptosis essentially contributes to neuronal loss during normal development, after acute neuronal injury, and in chronic degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer&#039;s disease, Huntington&#039;s disease, Parkinson&#039;s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A major function in initiation and progression of apoptosis has been attributed to members of the caspase family. Of the 14 caspases identified in mammals, caspase-3 is a key effector of neuronal apoptosis triggered by various stimuli. Our previous studies and numerous subsequent reports from other laboratories established a central role for this caspase in execution of neuronal loss in vivo and in vitro. We have shown that blockade of caspase-3 using commercially available peptide-based reagents leads to reduction of cell death and associated neurological dysfunction. Hence, results suggest that previously developed tetrapeptide caspase inhibitors can provide promising targets for therapeutic development. However, all currently available caspase inhibitors have serious limitations for use as potential antiapoptotic drugs. Largely these limitations include insufficient specificity against individual members of the caspase family and associated toxicity at higher effective doses. Our recent research was focused on identification of more promising compounds. As a result, we have identified a tetrapeptide analog containing a 1,4-benzodiazepine ring system (compound 1) characterized by the remarkable inhibitory specificity against caspase-3 activity."

Indeed, by 2020 it is expected that depression may be the second most serious medical condition with respect to global disease burden. It is clear that more effective pharmacotherapies are needed in treating depressive illness. Selective ligands for the norepinephrine transporter (NET) such as desipramine are quite effective in some patient populations, but their use is often limited by side effects, particularly those thought to be mediated by their anticholinergic properties.  More selective NET ligands may have considerable application in the treatment of depression. However, currently there are very few NET-selective ligands available. The studies described in this research proposal involve the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of novel conformationally constrained tricyclic tropane analogues that are designed to be potent NET-selective inhibitors.  For the best NET inhibitors identified, we will then screen them in animal models of depression.  Additionally, it is reasonable that such ligands could be utilized with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to assess changes in noradrenergic terminal fields in a variety of human conditions including depression.  Thus, these ligands could be a significant addition to the clinical armamentarium available to treat and diagnose psychiatric disease.

Preliminary modeling and analysis of this new transducer indicate output levels substantially in excess of those required are achievable at and above 100 Hz in water, with relatively low voltage drive levels. Furthermore, due to the non-resonant nature of its design, there is a nearly linear response in both the magitude and phase of the output within its target frequency range. This Phase I proposal describes our approach to achieving the desired design by structural and equivalent circuit analysis, parameter optimization, as well as by consultations with industry partners in the materials, fabrication and manufacturing space.

The type of resonant dynamical element to be used in the design to create the anisotropic mass densities required will be selected. Two major candidates identified in Phase I are resonant masses requiring voids encapsulated by high rigidity structures (e.g. shells) and a system of shaped inclusions embedded directly in an elastomer matrix. Laboratory experiments guided by co-evolving analytical and numerical models will be performed to demonstrate the required dynamical behavior for each treatment layer, to be followed by fabrication and testing larger cloak layer samples to assure that properties are maintained with scale up.

Although adaptive filtering and/or matched filter rejection will have some application, additional characteristics that separate gunfire from speech are needed for optimal noise cancellation. This proposal is based on those two features â the difference in directions of gunfire and the talker relative to the handset microphone, and on the closer proximity of the talker relative to the sources of gunfire. These additional features are basic to the proposed approach that uses new, patented technology. This new technology, termed PrivacyFone, employs a small microphone array that emphasizes the talkerâs voice signal by taking advantage of the fact that the array is in the near field (acoustic induction field) of the speech and not in the near field of the gunfire. The same array also rejects signals from directions associated with the gunfire. These features, basic to PrivacyFone, provide a way to discriminate against gunfire and enhance the speech signal. Any remnant of environmental noise that remains in the transmitted signal is then further rejected by an adaptive filtering scheme."

Potential military applications include making underwater objects invisible to threat sonar and creating quiet zones where, for example, otherwise noisy manned underwater operations can be safely carried out or where battlefield noise can be contained. Commercial applications are almost limitless. Metamaterials have been well described in the literature and some electromagnetic prototypes have been demonstrated. The key to making an acoustic metamaterial is anisotropy of its effective material properties. Very recently, designs for underwater spherical and cylindrical cloaks have been developed requiring that the effective density of a material be described as a tensor, that is, that it have two different values depending on direction. In this proposed project, a means to construct metamaterials with this property using very simple, inexpensive and rugged dynamical elements commonly used for vibration reduction will be demonstrated. A promising naval application will be identified and a suitable metamaterial and cloak geometry will be designed for it.

Such activities are of particular value in communicating with personnel who will wear ear canal insert earphones resistant to water and pressure, and still maintain a high degree of fidelity, frequency and dynamic range for the presentation of transmitted messages.

The attenuation required cannot be achieved by passive or active means alone, so they must be combined. Achieving high levels of attenuation by passive means requires the use of a deep insert earplug and possibly an external muff as well. The driver for the active system therefore has to fit within the envelope of the earplug, and be able to produce sound pressure levels at the eardrum high enough to effectively cancel the noise at that location. Using a systems model for the ANR earplug, we have determined in Phase I that three different basic designs (one electromagnetic and two electrostatic) have the potential for meeting these and other requirements.

The purpose of the work described here is to develop a systems model for the ANR earplug and employ that model to evaluate a variety of driver configurations that employ both electrostatic and electromagnetic transduction as a basis for fabrication and testing of candidate drivers in Phase II."

Such a capsule will facilitate imaging research on animal models to identify brain changes associated with the use and abuse of psychoactive substances, since acoustic noise stress interacts with the effects of these substances. A proof-of-principle capsule of a clear plastic will be built to accommodate a small primate and fit into a typical MRI system. Acoustical measurement equipment that can operate reliably in a MRI scanner's intense magnetic fields will be obtained and its performance will be verified. The intial capsule will be provided with various acoustic barrier arrangements consisting of double-wall structures and resilient layers topped by massive layers, with acoustically absorptive layers added on the exterior. The noise isolating performance of these barrier arrangements will be measured, modeled analytically, and optimized -- both for conventional scanning and for scanning protocols that generate acoustic noise in only limited frequency ranges. Detailed design of two prototype capsules with high acoustic attenuation will be carried out. The design will take account of non-acoustical requirements, such as the need to observe the test subject, the need to clean and disinfect the capsule, and accommodation of animals of slightly different sizes. An initial study aimed at enhancing the capsule's noise isolation performance by active control means will be performed. This study will address sensor and actuator locations and types, the transfer functions between these, and the control logic."

It deals with a situation that has been intractable for ANVC - the cancellation of transientdisturbances in modally rich and highly resonant structures and acoustical spaces. CSEA solves this problem by in effect modifying the structural transfer function so that small changes in structural stress or geometry that occur naturally do not cause thelarge changes in magnitude and phase of the transfer function to affect the estimation of the disturbing force that is necessary for feed-back ANVC. The proposal describes how we propose to continue the development of this procedure and how we will preparefor commercialization beyond Phase II. That development is carried out by a combination of experimental studies of a truss structure similar to that of a space telescope excited by various positioning and connect/disconnect devices in the system. The finalstep in the Phase II effort is the preliminary design of an embedded processor system that will serve as a prototype for the CSEA-ANVC product."

Attempts in the 1930's had little success because of inability to control the phase in electronics and transducers. Digital processing appeared to offer a solution for dealingwith phase and arriving at algorithms of a complexity that could not be realized by analog systems. There are applications where ANVC has achieved success; exhaust and inlet silencers, noise canceling headsets and active engine mounts, for example. Butthe promises of ANVC and investments made to develop products have been disappointing. One reason is technical. ANVC has been successful when the transfer functions between disturbance and receiver are simple. The systems through which the signals travelin most situations are complicated, and in detail, unknowable. Individual systems are complicated, and multiple realizations are variable. The estimation methods that ANVC has employed have not been able to deal with them. But, techniques developed forstructural response estimation, machine diagnostics, and dereverberation offer new ways to achieve ANVC. We term this approach"

The P. I. completed a NSF-supported SGER study that related product design choices and user reactions to the sound of the product. This study has used a panel of expert listeners to develop ""sensory profiles"" (SPs) for a limited range of product sounds, and a consumer jury to judge the same sounds in terms of product acceptability. Preliminary relationships have been established between the product SPs and physical metrics for these sounds, and between the product SPs and consumer judgements. This project seeks to determine the feasibility of extending the methodology developed to an expanded range of product sounds. Three major issues are addressed that will affect the utility of the concept as far as industry is concerned. One issue is the ability of metrics to anticipate user reactions to product sound because of their correlation with the product SPs. The second issue relates to the breadth of a product class that can be represented by a SPs. Variations on the sounds of particular vacuum cleaners and washing machines have been used as a way to develop the ideas, but this set needs to be expanded further. The third issue is concerned with products with different function but which are used in the same physical environment.
While there is widespread commercial interest in product sound quality, there is at present no structured way for manufacturers to relate the preference for sound to design goals. By developing methods that are broadly applicable and as easy to use as possible, the research can provide sound quality measurement procedures that can be applied to any product for which sound is an issue"

infects the urogenital, anorectal and pharyngeal tracts in humans. In 2018, there were an estimated 1.14M
cases in the US, and 86.9M cases worldwide. Of concern is the growing incidence of antimicrobial resistance
not only due to inappropriate use of antibiotics, but also because NG interacts with and acquires genetic
material from other co-infections in the anatomical sites that it infects. This wide range of resistance
mechanisms that NG isolates can potentially harbor makes it very challenging to develop rapid molecular
methods of Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing (AST). Even among phenotypic AST methods, it has so far not
been considered feasible to perform automated broth microdilution based ASTs on NG: principally because it
is a fastidious organism in liquid culture. As a result, the primary method used to perform ASTs for NG is the
manual agar dilution method, which (because it is so labor intensive) is currently conducted in only a very
limited number of public health labs. Even these labs test only 200-300 samples a month.
Acenxion Biosystems proposes to develop the first fully automated NG phenotypic AST platform that both
satisfies the current CDC guidance for surveillance and fulfils an unmet clinical need for AST-guided âdirectedâ
antibiotic therapy. Our instrument will provide Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Susceptible/
Intermediate /Resistance (S/I/R) interpretation in andlt; 6 hours with minimal sample preparation (andlt;5 min per
sample) at a reasonable price. The instrument will consist of stackable, cassette reader units with up to eight
microfluidic cassette capacity; software/PC Controller; and single-use consumable (50-well microfluidic
cassette pre-spotted with candidate antibiotics). Optimized broth and rapid stirring are employed for NG
growth, enabling automated broth microdilution. With prior funding from the CDC, we have demonstrated
proof-of-concept for the proposed instrument by building a partly-automated system to perform broth micro-
dilution experiments on a single 16-well cassette, and used it monitor the growth (or lack thereof) of 3 NG
strains (1 ATTC QC strain, and 2 AR isolate strains) in the presence of multiple candidate antibiotics with
100% sensitivity andamp; specificity. We seek âDirect to Phase IIâ funds to expand this earlier work: build a fully
automated instrument and test it against the CDCâs challenge AR bank panel of 50 clinical isolates (which span
multiple resistance mechanisms and yield wide range of phenotypic responses). We chose this set of
organisms in lieu of patient samples from 2 - 3 locations to ensure better chances of success in the real world.
Our commercialization strategy aims to first bring efficiencies to the existing market (regional labs participating
in the Gonococcal Isolate Survey Program) and then to expand the user (customer) base to hospital labs,
clinical laboratory networks and clinical labs by enabling AST-guided directed antibiotic therapy for gonorrhea.Narrative
Sexually transmitted infections caused by N. gonorrhoeae (NG) continues to be a
critical healthcare concern, as evidenced by the inclusion of NG in both CDCâs 2019
AMR Threat Reports List, and in WHOâs 2017 Priority List. The lack of a practical and
automated susceptibility test (AST) for NG is a significant contributor to the growing
problem of NG AMR, resulting in a lack of targeted antibiotic therapy. We propose the
development of the first automated and scalable NG AST that will eliminate the labor-
intensive methods currently used for this purpose."

Most women are
diagnosed with metastatic ovarian cancer, and the 5-year survival rate for this late stage disease is less than
28%. The mainstay of treatment for ovarian cancer entails debulking cytoreductive surgery in combination with
adjuvant chemotherapies. Unfortunately, severe side effects of these chemotherapies compromise the quality
of life and result in poor patient compliance, and the relapse rate is high due to intrinsic and acquired therapy
resistance. Therefore, there is a pressing need for the development of new safe and effective treatment
strategies. Our group has developed a novel pH and redox potential dual responsive polymer, poly[(2-(pyridin-
2-yldisulfanyl)-co-[poly(ethylene glycol)]] (PDA-PEG), which can be degraded intracellularly. If used as a drug
carrier, this polymer system significantly improves the cancer cell killing effect and potentially reduces the off-
target toxicity of the carried chemotherapeutic drugs. More excitingly, follow-up studies revealed that the
combination of PDA-PEG and copper ions, termed polymer-metal nanocomplex (PMC), without being loaded
with any chemotherapeutic drugs, could effectively kill a large variety of cancer cells, including drug-resistant
ovarian cancer cells. Importantly, the PMC showed excellent cancer cell-selective killing; it could induce
apoptosis in various cancer cells with a 30-100-fold improved IC50 over non-cancer cells. Furthermore, a
preliminary study showed that PMC significantly inhibited tumor growth in an ovarian cancer mouse model.
Based on these technology advancements and exciting in vitro and in vivo results, we propose to develop the
PDA-PEG/Cu PMC into a novel safe and effective therapy for ovarian cancer and possible other malignant
tumors. In this STTR Phase I project, we propose two specific aims. SA1. To test the toxicity of the PDA-
PEG/Cu PMC in vitro and in vivo. Since besides in the tumors, PMC may also accumulate in the liver and the
reticuloendothelial system, we will test the toxicity of the PMC on primary mouse cells including bone morrow-
derived macrophages and dendritic cells, T cells, vascular endothelial cells, and hepatocytes, as well
commercially available human primary cells including hepatocytes, vascular endothelial cells and mononuclear
cells. We will then test the in vivo toxicity of PMC in tumor-free C57Bl/6 mice and Balb/c mice. SA2. To test the
in vivo efficacy of the PDA-PEG/Cu PMC in treating metastatic ovarian cancer. We will test the efficacy of PMC
in treating peritoneal metastatic ovarian cancer when PMC is administered intraperitoneally, compared to
cisplatin. A syngeneic ovarian cancer mouse model (C57Bl/6 mice inoculated with ID8-Luc cells) will be used;
therefore, we will be able to access the efficacy of PMC in the presence of host immune response. We will also
examine if PMC and cisplatin result in synergistic benefit. The efficacy and toxicity of PMC also will be tested
using a humanized mouse model (CD34+ HU-NSGTM) transplanted with patient-derived ovarian tumors.Narrative: Ovarian cancer is estimated to cause 13,980 deaths in American women in 2019, new safe and
effective treatment strategies are urgently needed. This research will develop a novel patented polymer-metal
nanocomplex system for the treatment of ovarian cancer. The success of this project will provide a new tool to
fight against the devastating disease."

million each year, resulting in about 270,000 deaths and over $20 billion in healthcare costs. Sepsis results
from infection of any microorganisms with bacteria being the most common. Pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) activate innate immune cells, macrophages in particular,
as well as tissue resident cells such as vascular endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes through Toll-like
receptors (TLRs). The activated macrophages engulf and kill the microbes. On the one hand, this process may
reduce microbial load and limit the infection. On the other hand, these activated macrophages may elicit a
stronger than desirable inflammatory response by secreting excess amounts of cytokines and oxidative
molecules, acting on tissue resident cells and leading to tissue damage. Moreover, the damaged tissues
release endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which further escalate the inflammatory
cascade through binding to TLRs, particularly TLR2 and TLR4, on immune cells and tissue resident cells. This
vicious cycle rapidly leads to multi-organ injury, and eventually death. The quick evolution and the complexity
of the pathology of bacterial sepsis make it extremely difficult to treat. Current management still relies on
source control, antibiotics, and organ support. Although inflammation plays a key detrimental role in the
pathogenesis of septic shock, no anti-inflammatory approaches have been proved successful due to various
reasons. In the past 10 years, we and collaborators 1) isolated a new single compound from Chinese herbs,
determined its structure, and named it Sparstolonin B (SsnB); 2) characterized SsnB as a dual TLR2 and TLR4
antagonist; 3) discovered that SsnB antagonizes TLR2/4 by disrupting the interaction between TIRAP and
MyD88, a unique key event in TLR2/4 signaling; 4) demonstrated that SsnB effectively inhibits inflammatory
responses of multiple cell lines and primary cell types to both exogenous and endogenous TLR2/4 ligands; 5)
showed that SsnB inhibits the hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte inflammatory response and apoptosis in cell
culture and in live heart slices; 6) reported that intraperitoneal administration of SsnB effectively reduced the
death of LPS endotoxemic mice; and 7) in most recent preliminary study demonstrated that SsnB prolonged
survival of male CD-1 mice using a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model. On the basis on these
achievements, we are in a unique position to develop SsnB as a novel therapy for bacterial sepsis. Toward this
goal, we propose in this STTR phase I project to establish the feasibility of clinical development. We propose
two specific aims: SA1. To establish the effectiveness of SsnB in various mouse strains using the CLP model
of bacterial sepsis; and SA2. To optimize the therapeutic regimen of SsnB to treat CLP-induced sepsis. We
believe this safe and effective natural compound has the potential to reduce the mortality of bacterial sepsis
and reduce healthcare and related costs tremendously.NARRATIVE: Bacterial sepsis is a devastating condition that results in high mortality and huge healthcare
cost. In the past 10 years, we discovered and mechanistically characterized a Chinese herb-derived

associated treatments. Cachexia is associated with reduced physical function, decreased tolerance for
treatment, and increased mortality. Moreover, a cachexia diagnosis is consistent with a doubling in duration of
hospital stay and an additional cost of $4,000/case compared to non-cachectic patients. Cachexia has been
reported following chemotherapy treatment including muscle mass loss and fatigue which contribute to
reduced quality of life. Furthermore, the loss of lean mass with cachexia impairs chemotherapy treatment
tolerance and can exacerbate functional decrements leading to functional dependencies and accrued health
care cost. Single and combined chemotherapeutic agents such as 5 fluorouracil (5FU) and FOLFIRINOX have
been shown to directly disrupt skeletal muscle mass and function in tumor-bearing mice. Additionally, 5FU and
FOLFIRINOX administration in animals and humans induces body weight loss associated with skeletal muscle
mass loss and disrupted mitochondrial function, representing as an ideal model to study cachexia. Currently,
there are no approved therapies for cachexia despite the improvements in our understanding of the
mechanisms underlying muscle wasting. Quercetin, a natural polyphenol found in various fruits and
vegetables, has been recognized for its anti-inflammatory properties and its ability to increase mitochondrial
biogenesis. We have collected convincing data that support further investigation of Quercetin as an agent to
prevent/treat cachexia: 1) we reported that Quercetin can reduce cancer-induced cachexia; 2) we showed that
Quercetin can reduce the physical fatigue that is associated with chemotherapy; 3) we reported that Quercetin
can increase physical performance by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis; and 4) we showed that Quercetin
can reduce inflammation in a number of disease models. However, Quercetin has not yet been developed as
an agent to prevent or treat cachexia. Our long-term goal is to move this dietary compound towards human
clinical trials as an innovative agent to prevent/treat cachexia. In this Phase I SBIR project we will rigorously
test the hypothesis that dietary Quercetin will ameliorate the cancer and chemotherapy-induced cachexia and
thereby result in improved therapeutic outcomes. Three specific aims are proposed: 1) evaluate Quercetinâs
effects on ameliorating cancer and chemotherapy-induced cachexia, 2) establish the effective plasma and
muscle levels and dosing interval for Quercetin, and 3) perform a subchronic oral toxicity screening of
Quercetin in mice. The success of our proposed phase I SBIR study will further the development of Quercetin
as a new agent to prevent/treat cachexia. A follow-up Phase II SBIR program will expand on these initial
studies to: 1) complete efficacy studies of Quercetin using additional models of cachexia; and 2) complete
advanced pharmaceutical toxicology studies in mice. The overall goal of Phase II will be to position AcePre
LLC for an FDA Pre-Investigational New Drug package.PROJECT NARRATIVE

However, developing these compounds into clinical drugs has been hindered by their limited supply. Acera Biosciences, Inc. has developed a strategy to produce these compounds in fermentation. The proposed research project focuses on developing heterologous expression systems for the production of these compounds. Using the newly cloned barbamide biosynthetic pathway as a test pathway, a group of four vector-host systems will be developed. Foreign pathway expression in these systems will be evaluated at the transcription, translation, and functional levels to provide guidance for improvement. The resulting satisfactory system(s) will be extended and applied to produce valuable marine natural products in the next phase of experiments. The proposed method will alleviate the supply shortage of some potent marine natural products in drug development. Moreover, it will help to expand the current anticancer drug tests to more marine natural product that are otherwise unavailable because of limited supply."

 polyketide macrolactones with deoxysugars are key enzymes for combinatorial
 biosynthesis of novel macrolide anti-infective agents. In this proposal, a new
 gene shuffling technology, RACHITT, is applied to the desosarninyl transferase
 (Des VII) from the pikromycin biosynthetic pathway of Streptomyces venezuelae.
 Des VII is an enzyme with remarkable inherent substrate flexibility, and we
 expect to expand further its substrate spectrum to include 16-membered ring
 macrolactones. This technology is expected to provide glycosyltransferase
 enzymes that can catalyze the biosynthesis of 12-, 14-, and 16-membered ring
 macrolides. Moreover, we expect to generate a recombinant DesVII that has a
 higher enzymatic activity toward the 14-membered ring macrolactone narbonolide.
 This will be a key step in combinatorial biosynthesis of ketolide antibiotics
 that have a potential to combat multi-drug resistant bacterial pathogens.

Such effects are encountered in bond breaking, at transition states, for complex open shell systems like transition metal atoms, and for excited states. The applicable MRCC methods include state-universal and state-specific Hilbert space approaches, and valence universal Fock space methods. They will be assessed for formal consistency and numerical performance, and further compared to the best possible single-reference CC results, which defines the state-of-the-art in the field. There is no MRCC method that yet satisfies all preferred formal properties, encouraging new developments. Armed with this MRCC assessment, in Phase II, the most promising approaches will be further generalized and written into the massively parallel ACES III system that currently runs at >80% efficiency on 40,000 processors enabling DoD scientists and others to routinely make such applications to their problems. Currently ACES offers the best and most extensive collection of single-reference CC applications for comparison.

The basic longitudinal survey instrument has been supplemented with data from a variety of other sources including Social Security Administration records containing the detailed earnings history of the respondent. Under current HRS protocols, the use of the SSA data is restricted. Investigators must make special security arrangements to obtain these ?les, which they can not redistribute once they complete their analyses. These protocols are necessary to preserve the confidentiality of the underlying HRS and SSA micro data, which is essential to the continued willingness of respondents to participate in the study, but they severely limit the usefulness of the SSA data. New statistical disclosure limitation methods have been developed that promise to provide much of the information in confidential micro data in a manner that permits much wider dissemination and use of the protected data. This project is a Phase I feasibility study of applying these new methods, called synthetic data, to a subset of the variables in the SSA records that link to the general-use RAND-HRS data. The project has three main components: (1) port a general data synthesizer that was developed at the U.S. Census Bureau for use with SSA data linked to the Survey of Income and Program Participation for adaptation to the HRS/SSA link; (2) synthesize a few variables from the HRS/SSA link and test their usefulness in statistical modeling; (3) perform studies of the statistical disclosure risk associated with linking synthetic SSA data to the RAND-HRS general-release ?le. If the confidentiality-protected data prove scientifically useful and if the statistical disclosure risk can be controlled, then Phase II of the research would synthesize the entire HRS/SSA data link. The project scientists will work with the HRS Data Release Protocol Committee and SSA to develop appropriate certifications of the statistical disclosure avoidance provided by the methods. 1 7 Project Narrative Many users of the Health and Retirement Study general-release data ?les would benefit from some access to the restricted-release ?les without the requirement for special security arrangements. Critical variables on the restricted- release data from the Social Security Administration earnings histories will be confidentiality-protected using powerful new methods that preserve privacy while allowing many important statistical analyses to be performed combining the protected SSA and general-release HRS data. If the demonstration is successful, the methods will be extended to the entire HRS/SSA linked data in a future project."

In large doses, APAP causes acute liver failure and is the leading cause of acute liver failure in the US. Thecurrent laboratory test for the diagnosis of APAP toxicity, measurement of APAP levels in peripheral blood, is only effective in the first 24 hours of APAP overdose. Acetaminophen Toxicity Diagnostics (ATD), LLC has developed a rapid, point-of-care diagnostic assay (dipstick) for the measurement of APAP protein adducts. Adducts are sensitive and specific biomarkers of APAP hepatotoxicity that may be detected in peripheral blood 6 to 7 days after a toxic overdose of APAP. The dipstick detects APAP irreversibly bound to proteins (APAP protein adducts) by using antibodies specific for adducts in the detection system. The dipstick is reliable, accurate and provides rapid results. In Specific Aim 1, the dipstick will be calibrated to detect levels of APAP protein adducts corresponding to severe liver toxicity and 2000 precision manufactured, research use dipsticks will be produced. In Specific Aim 2, the dipsticks will be tested internally for stability, specificity, and diagnostic sensitivity using stored, frozen clinical samples. In Specific Aim 3, six major hepatology centers will participate in a study to measure dipstick performance in patients with acute liver injury and acute liver failure. Successful completion of these aims will establish the clinical utility of the dipstick, an innovation that will enhance the diagnosis of APAP toxicity.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acetaminophen is the most widely used drug for the treatment of pain and fever around the world. Large doses of acetaminophen can cause acute liver failure and death. Diagnostic tests are needed for patients that have acetaminophen related liver injury. The current laboratory test only works in the first 24 hours after acetaminophen overdose. Acetaminophen Toxicity Diagnostics, LLC has developed a rapid dipstick test that measures biomarkers of acetaminophen liver injury. These biomarkers (known as acetaminophen protein adducts) can be measured in the blood samples of patients with acetaminophen related liver injury for 6 to 7 days after theoverdose. This project will further develop the dipstick test so that it can be available to physicians in the future."

APAP toxicity is the most common cause of acut
e liver failure (ALF) in the United States and Great Britain today. Toxicity is mediated by conversion of the parent drug to a reactive metabolite that covalently binds to protein as APAP-protein adducts. APAP-protein adducts appear in serum as a result of
 the toxicity and are an excellent biomarker of toxicity. The diagnosis of acute APAP overdose is currently made by determination of the APAP level in serum within 24 hours of receiving the toxic dose, or by elevation of hepatic transaminases in serum, acc
ompanied by a history of toxic dosing. This approach has numerous limitations and the elevation of hepatic transaminases is nonspecific. Acetaminophen Toxicity Diagnostics, LLC will test the hypothesis is that APAP-protein adducts can be determined using a
n antibody-based dipstick assay. This will be accomplished through the following Specific Aims: 1): Develop a rapid prototype dipstick assay for determination of APAP-protein adducts. 2): Demonstrate the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the protot
ype dipstick assay for detection of APAP- protein adducts in the serum of APAP overdose victims. Results of the dipstick assay will be compared to in parallel examination of APAP protein adducts using an established high performance liquid chromatography
 assay with electrochemical detection. Development of a sensitive and rapid assay for APAP-protein adducts will enhance the diagnosis of APAP poisoning in clinical settings and lead to the earlier identification of individuals at risk for severe liver toxi

An estimated 400,000 children are born each year with one of these hemoglobin disorders. Few treatments exist to alleviate the symptoms of hemoglobinopathies and none are approved for children. Sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia remain an unmet medical need and a large public health burden. Reactivation of the expression of fetal hemoglobin can reverse many of the symptoms of beta hemoglobinopathies. Thus far treatments that induce expression of fetal hemoglobin also decrease or disrupt normal cell division and are associated with severe side effects. Recently the role of HDAC1 and 2 in the suppression of fetal hemoglobin expression was shown by genetic ablation of these genes. Compounds that are selective for HDAC1 and 2 versus other HDACs can induce the expression offetal globin in adult erythroid cells. We have generated a set of selective HDAC1/2 inhibitors with drug like properties. We plan to advance one of these compounds into pre-clinical development for beta hemoglobinopathies. We will test the activity of these compounds at inducing fetal globin gene expression in adult erythroid cells. We will also determine if this induction of fetal globin is accompanied by changes in erythroid cell division or differentiation. We will confirm that our compounds can inducefetal hemoglobin in cells from patients with beta-hemoglobinopathies. Finally, we will explore the mechanism of action of HDAC1/2 inhibition by examining changes in chromatin structure and function in the beta globin locus. The final product of this PhaseI project will be a selective HDAC1/2 inhibitor that can induce fetal hemoglobin in adult erythroid cells that will be advanced as a candidate for pre-clinical development. A Phase II project building off of this work would further advance the molecule through development toward filing of an IND for beta hemoglobinopathies.

Related Peptide (CGRP) antagonist for the treatment of migraine. We identified a series of
peptides, designed on the salmon calcitonin backbone, which due to a slow receptor off-rate
have an extended duration of action in vivo. In a rodent model measuring CGRP-induced
vasodilation, at the middle meningeal artery, our lead peptide antagonist ACX101 was far
superior, at a low dose of 20 mcg/kg, to a small molecule inhibitor dosed at 300 mcg/kg. While
a challenging assay to accomplish, it is a more relevant CGRP-related readout than the typical
assay where vasodilation was caused by capsaicin to study the effect of a CGRP antagonist or
antibody. Due to a complicated physiology, it is important to note that there is no generally
accepted assay for migraine that is clinically predictive. Small molecule antagonists from
Boehringer Ingelheim and Merck were dropped from the clinic due to compound-related
toxicity. Small molecule inhibitors are thus dose-limited, resulting in marginal benefits over
placebo control. Since ACX101 is composed of natural amino acids it will be cleared by the
kidneys, as small peptide fragments, thus circumventing the liver. ACX101 has also
demonstrated superior potency to a CGRP antibody in the same rodent assay where the
antibody was about 50% effective. Incidentally, clinical data from CGRP antibodies have
demonstrated reductions in migraine-related pain symptoms averaging 50%. ACX101 is fully
effective within 30 minutes and neutralizes CGRP-related vasodilation sustainably for over 90
minutes (the assay duration). Since peptide therapeutics are rapidly metabolized and cleared
physiologically, we propose slow-release formulations that extend drug efficacy from a few
days to two weeks. This would primarily address the needs of patients who suffer from low to
medium frequency migraine episodes (less than 15 days/month). The proposed formulation
choices have been clinically validated, resulting in a number of slow-release drugs with
efficacy extended to four months from a single dose form. The resulting therapeutic will
substantially benefit unserved patients if the preclinical efficacy and formulation choices
translate in the clinic. Benefitting from widely used manufacturing processes, both for peptide
synthesis and formulations, the cost of a peptide-based therapeutic will be substantially lower
than antibodies which are currently priced at close to $7000/year. Additionally, the proposed
formulations could be dosed as needed thus avoiding antibody therapeutics with substantially
longer half-lives that result in physiological effects of greater than 3 months.Narrative: The application relates to slow-release formulations of a peptide Calcitonin
Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) antagonist that would primarily benefit episodic migraine
sufferers. We propose the use of readily available FDA-approved biodegradable polymers,
with proven degradation kinetics, that will sustain drug exposure ranging from 3 to 15 days."

We are the manufacturer of ophthalmic diagnostic instruments with core expertise of solid state lighting and digital image systems. Our in-home non-contact tonometer does not require special skills to use. Once it approves feasible, it will allow thousands of patients with progressive glaucomatous damage to keep track of their intraocular pressure (IOP) between office visits and to provide their physicians with a complete picture of their individual IOP level and fluctuations. This device will expand our understanding of the glaucoma progression, improve glaucoma management, promote early diagnosis and enhance glaucoma medication or surgical treatment. The system will provide the relevant cornea anatomical parameters and one of the aims of this research is to create an algorithm enable the derivation of an IOP independent of the biomechanical properties of cornea. To validate our design we will compare the results of TCST with the results of a Goldmann applanation tonometer with an artificial eye model that includes various cornea configurations. Accuracy and repeatability of both measurements will be compared using a calibrated manometer as reference. We will conclude our innovation is feasible if TCST measurement demonstrates an accuracy of 11mm Hg and its repeatability is comparable with the repeatability of Goldmann tonometer measurements. Our patent pending concept requires a digital image system similar to a modern day cell phone with multi-color solid state strobes. Thus the device can be manufactured economically. The information from this device is very traceable and manageable because the size of the digital image file is relatively small. The IOP information can be derived locally or can be recorded and analyzed remotely via internet. In addition to the contribution to glaucoma management, this research will add another dimension to the 3-D anterior chamber topography. It will add the modulus and/or other relevant mechanical properties of cornea to the anatomical parameters of the cornea. Thus, this research could evolve into a new dynamic topographer that will expand our understanding of the cornea and further refine the refractive surgeries. Due to its independence of the cornea shape, this device will also address the unmet care for patients with keratoconus, the most common corneal dystrophy in the United States. .PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will generate an important tool for the management of glaucoma, especially for early detection of glaucoma and for customized medication and/or surgical procedures, through two-color-strobe- technology (TCST) to achieve easy-to-use home monitoring of intraocular pressures (IOP) without contacting the cornea. This will allow quick detection and accurate IOP-based glaucoma events for use of event-adjusted therapeutics that will avoid the current adverse time delays that are associated with sporadic clinical visits in care of glaucoma patients."

Nicotine is highly addictive: andgt;95% of unaided attempts at smoking cessation fail by 6 months. Electronic (e)-
cigarettes (vaping) are nicotine-delivery devices that may be useful in some individuals for smoking cessation
but are not FDA-approved as a smoking cessation aid and long-term use may have uncertain health impacts.
Evidence suggests that vaping nicotine may also raise cardiovascular and pulmonary disease risks. Many
experts and professional societies recommend that vapers should also attempt to stop using nicotine e-
cigarettes. However, treatments to aid e-cigarette cessation have yet to be identified or FDA-approved.
This project will test whether cytisine, a partial nAChR agonist that reduces the severity of nicotine withdrawal
symptoms while inhibiting nicotine reward effects in the brain, can promote cessation of e-cigarette use. Prior
trials have shown cytisineâs efficacy for smoking cessation, and it has been marketed as a smoking cessation
aid in Europe for decades. Achieve Life Sciences has recently (past 3 years) expedited the US clinical
development program for cytisine as a smoking cessation aid and now proposes to test for vaping cessation.
This will be the first multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled Pilot study conducted in daily nicotine e-
cigarette users to evaluate the benefit and safety of cytisine as a vaping cessation aid. The primary objective is
to assess if subjects randomized to 12 weeks of 3 mg cytisine three times a day (TID), vs placebo TID, have a
higher prevalence of biochemically- verified nicotine vaping cessation from Week 9 to Week 12. Secondary
objectives include assessment of cytisine vs placebo regarding: 1. Earlier vaping cessation initiated at Week 3-
6 or Week 6-9; 2. Vaping reduction, measured by weekly quantitative cotinine levels; 3. Testing moderation
effects in efficacy outcomes across subgroups defined by demographic and baseline characteristics. The safety
objective will compare the safety profile of cytisine vs placebo when administered for 12 weeks.
This study will enroll 150 adult subjects (â¥18 years) at 8 US sites, who are daily nicotine e-cigarette users and
not current cigarette smokers (confirmed by saliva cotinine and expired carbon monoxide [CO] levels), intending
to quit vaping, and willing to set a quit date 7-14 days from the start of study treatment. Subjects will be randomly
assigned (2:1) to one of two arms: (cytisine 3 mg TID N=100, or identical placebo TID N=50) for 12 weeks study
treatment. All subjects will receive concurrent behavioral support for nicotine/vaping cessation during the study.
Study treatment will be double-blind. Vaping status (abstinence) will be assessed by self-report after the planned
quit target of 7-14 days post-randomization and assessed weekly from Week 2 through Week 12, including
weekly biochemical verification via measurement of salivary cotinine levels. Expired CO levels will be monitored
for smoking relapse. Subjects will be assessed for safety during Week 1 of treatment, and weekly thereafter,
during the treatment period. Success will be measured as â¥20-30% cessation in the intervention group, and
statistically significant (pâ¤0.1 or 0.05) cytisine benefit in other endpoints.NARRATIVE
Nicotine is highly addictive, and new electronic nicotine-delivery devices (e-cigarettes) have become popular
but have uncertain long-term health impacts including potential cardiovascular and pulmonary disease risks
and pulmonary inflammation. Effective pharmacotherapies for nicotine vaping cessation are a priority for public
health. Cytisine is a natural compound that has been successfully used in Central and Eastern Europe as a
smoking cessation aid for several decades, and in this project Achieve Life Sciences has proposed a pilot
clinical study to test the benefit of a newly revised cytisine treatment regimen as a nicotine e-cigarette (vaping)
cessation aid."

The ample competition on both the demand and the supply side of electrification drives technological innovation and cost reductions, resulting in the ever-accelerating adoption and the corresponding economic growth. Yet, this growth is at risk of being stunted if the transmission system, as it accommodates bulk power transfers from new generation sources to newly electrified loads, becomes a limiting factor. Recognizing the scale of the opportunity and the weight of the risk, the DOEâs Office of Electricity is seeking disruptive innovations to enhance power transmission and delivery over long distances to provide additional system flexibility, security, and resilience. The proposed project will develop a software product to quantify attainable increases in transfer capacities of the US transmission system by widespread deployment of transmission control technologies. The focus is on power-electronic-based flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) controllers. FACTS controllers can be built on existing rights-of-way and are able to route power flows through transmission lines hundreds of miles long, at a capital cost comparable to building just three to five miles of new lines. Remarkably, the key barrier to their adoption is not the maturity of converter technology; it is the complexity of analytical processes needed to evaluate their impact to increasing transmission flows and the corresponding benefits."

While traditional cybersecurity focuses on an analysis of extrinsic vulnerabilities, by looking, for example, for known malware signatures in network packets or estimating which system components or sensitive data are likely to be compromised, a complementary analysis of intrinsic vulnerabilities is often lacking. These vulnerabilities reveal where and how the system could be severely compromised if an attacker or other disruption could affect the right system components in particular ways, simply due to the way the cyber, physical, and human components of the system interact with each other. Achilles Heel Technologies has developed expertise and tools to identify, analyze, and mitigate intrinsic vulnerabilities. These tools have been applied to broad range of critical infrastructure technologies, including precision agriculture, regional water management, UAV swarms, and Next-Generation 911 networks. Our approach uses a proprietary technique to extract an attack surface model from first principles descriptions of the system operation and a hypothesis of attacker capabilities or disruption potential. We then apply a suite of mathematical tools from robust control in order to discover the kinds of dynamic, coordinated and distributed perturbations that could compromise the systemâs operation within the hypothetical admissible set. Iterating over different hypotheses of attacker capabilities (e.g. single point of failure vs. coordinated distributed attacks) and different model information (e.g common knowledge vs. insider information) can reveal distinct, quantified characterizations of system vulnerability (e.g. the system may be secure to single points of failure but vulnerable to certain coordinated distributed attacks that exploit specific insider information). This analysis is encoded in software and delivered to system administrators, who can use the tool to quantify risk associated with attack or other disruptions, check the current system status, evaluate the implications of component upgrades or proposed system changes, and ultimately make informed decisions for allocating cybersecurity and emergency resources. Phase I of this project will be devoted to exploring the feasibility of these techniques to power systems. In particular, we will: 1. Apply our attack design methodology to simplified linear power system models to confirm that the approach to vulnerability analysis is sensible for a local system analysis; and 2. Apply a specific nonlinear model reduction technique, the Model Boundary Approximation Method (MBAM), to an established power system model in order to confirm that this method of model reduction can be applied to nonlinear power system models to yield useful lower-order approximations, possible attack-surface models for the entire system. Successful completion of both objectives in Phase I will then motivate Phase II, where the linear, and thus local, attack design methodology is extended to become a global technique for power system analysis using MBAM. In Phase III we will work with potential customers to build models of specific, regional power systems and adapt the software interface to best support customer needs. The tools we develop as part of this initiative have the potential revolutionize organizational awareness of power system cybersecurity and emergency response."

The economic costs are substantial and more than one million people die of TB infections each year. Before the arrival of antimicrobial therapy, TB was one of leading causes of human deaths with high mortality rates common in untreated cases of active TB infections. With the discovery of effective drugs against the disease, it became possible to cure the illness. However, antimicrobial resistance has been rising over time. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and now extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains that resist most first-line and second-line agents are appearing that are difficult to successfully treat. The isothiazoloquinolone (ITQ) ACH- 702 was shown to have antibacterial activity against both non-dividing and biofilm staphylococci and to be active against MTB including MDR/XDR strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 1 5g/mL or less. These data suggested the potential of ITQs in shortening the duration of treatment for susceptible strains, in killing latent MTB in the host, and in effective therapy for MDR/XDR strains. However, ACH-702 was found to have suboptimal pharmacokinetic (PK) properties that precluded development as an oral agent. A prototype analog ACH-0141998, a hydroxythienoquinolone (HTQ), demonstrated improved metabolic stability and suggests a path forward to further analogs with better safety profiles and PK properties capable of supporting oral dosing. In Phase I, we will generate a series of HTQ analogs and evaluate them in a series of in vitro assays and select candidates for further advancement. The ultimate goal of this Phase I proposal is to identify a compound(s) that has metabolic stability and improved antibacterial activity against MTB including MDR/XDR strains. In Phase II, we will initiate in vivo testing including PK studies, acute and repeat-dose animal toxicity studies, and assessment of effectiveness in animal models.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a major global health concern. The spread of multidrug-resistant MDRTB isolates threatens to undermine our ability to treat these infections. The overall goal of this project is to identify antimicrobial compounds that have the potential to successfully treat both wild-type and MDRTB isolates."

The current drug cocktails need to include inhibitors of viral components that are likely to slow resistance development. One such target is the HIV-1 capsid, an essential viral protein, where mutations are lethal or lead to production of non-infectious viral particles. Discovery of compounds that affect the assembly of structural proteins is challenging due to lack of a biochemical assay that can be adopted for high throughput screening of large compound libraries. We have recently reported an inhibitor of capsid assembly that reduced viral infectivity by ca. 95%. Cap-1 (ACH-1033940) was identified by combining the Computational Chemistry, NMR, and Virology efforts. Phase I of this proposal includes identification of a potent capsid assembly inhibitor (EC50 <10 mu/M, therapeutic index >10) as well as discovery of additional potent and drug like capsid ligands. The Phase I goal will be accomplished using a dual approach of rationally designing and synthesizing focused libraries of ACH-0133940 analogs and Virtual Screening of proprietary and commercial compound libraries to identify novel capsid ligands. The potential ligands will be screened for capsid binding by NMR and for inhibition of HIV by in vitro antiviral assays. Resistance induction studies will be carried out to confirm that inhibition of HIV infectivity is due to the inhibition of capsid assembly.

Simulation and performance estimation of the TMACN is of utmost importance to the design and eventual deployment of this mission-critical solution.The proposed innovation is a wireless MANET simulator consisting of a semiconductor-based highly-parallel multiprocessor asynchronous Network-on-a-Chip (NoC) and an associated software architecture to enable faster-than-realtime (FTR) simulation of ad hoc networks with many thousands of nodes. By leveraging an existing NoC prototype, built in 2005 by the PI and Cornell University in a 0.18Ã¬m CMOS process, and the existing software environment, we will develop an architecture design for a scalable hardware architecture and an associated software environment to simulate large TMACNs. We will then perform a detailed scalability analysis and trade-off analysis to assist in the development of a software design and low cost highly parallel multiprocessor-based single-chip hardware platform for a 90nm prototype in Phase II that will support several hundred to several thousand node TMACNs."

It will consist of a passive embedded sensor and a handheld portable detector, operating on the principle of the coupling of the LC tank circuit withthe behavior of a strain sensitive resistor. This system uses well known principles of an electronic circuit with carefully balanced forces of inductance and capacitance, applied in a novel manner to provide the following advantages: The passive embeddedsensor is affordable. The response of the embedded sensor is highly reproducible, based on the inherent properties of its fabrication process. The sensor can be tuned for excellent sensitivity in a variety of configurations and applications. The embeddingprocess does not impact the mechanical properties of the host. Used in composite applications, internal composite crack/flaw may be assessed remotely. The detector will exploit the properties of the gate dip meter and its ability to detect resonance inthe RCL circuit and the sharpness of that resonance, Q. The detector will be designed for ease of operation. Its operation is remote, non-destructive, and allows simple data interpretation. This crack/flaw detection system offers military andcommercial contractors an essential new tool to portably monitor and periodically measure small cracks and flaws in advanced composites much the way they now keep track of cracks in aluminum airframes and structures. This is all done on a non-intrusivebasis without the need for disassembly. One example is the composite inspection needed at a deployed logistics support center for composites in the THAAD program."

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. While anti-VEGF compounds Avastin(r) and Lucentis(r) are effective in the treatment of the wet (acute, sight threatening) form of AMD, they must be administered frequently by intravitreal (IVT) injections. IVT injections involve a number of serious risks including retinal detachment, endophthalmitis, increased IOP and cataractogenesis. Frequent intraocular injections are not patient friendly and burdens our health care system with expensive procedures as they also take up a great deal of time out of the schedules of retinal specialists who are limited in numbers in the United States (less than 2500)."

Without PAH, the patient with PKU cannot metabolize phenylalanine (PHE) to tyrosine. The resulting accumulation of PHE and the accumulation of phenylpyruvate by a secondary metabolic pathway in the patient&#039;s blood produce neuropathies including severe mental retardation, behavioral problems, schizophrenia, and tremors. PKU treatment is tailored to keep plasma PHE concentrations between 2 and 6 mg/dl through a low-PHE diet and frequent blood monitoring. The invasiveness of this monitoring exposes the patient to infection risk, hypodermophobia (especially in children), plus the inconvenience and expense of performing invasive procedures and mailing or delivering the sample to the treatment center. We propose developing and commercializing a novel non-invasive, in-home monitoring device that can sample PHE through the patient&#039;s skin and correlate extracted PHE to blood concentrations with a high degree of accuracy and reproducibility using ACiont&#039;s proprietary reverse iontophoretic process. During development, we will team up with a bioengineering firm to develop a PHE biosensor for real-time, quantitative analysis. When complete, our device will allow patients to: easily perform the test and obtain results in a home setting, reduce clinic visit frequency by allowing result communications with clinicians over the internet, get real-time data with which to tailor treatment, decrease overall treatment costs through increased efficiency and elimination of third party laboratories, and drastically improve their control over PKU."

Physiological monitoring would be useful to researchers and therapists, particularly during the patient's daily life. Psychophysiological markers could be used to evaluate and tailor individual patient treatment and to tell patients when and how to relax. Furthermore, physiological parameters could help determine who is at risk for developing PTSD after traumatic events facilitating early intervention. Several studies have demonstrated that PTSD is associated with changes in various physiological parameters; however, current tools are too cumbersome and cannot feasibly monitor these parameters during a patient's everyday life. Successful development and commercialization of an ambulatory PTSD monitor could lead to improved patient treatment, faster recovery, and reduced healthcare costs. The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate and commercialize an ambulatory PTSD monitor that can measure relevant physiological parameters for long periods of time without disrupting the patient's life. In addition to integrating multiple parameters into a compact wearable device, the device will incorporate sensor and algorithm intellectual property for improved signal to noise ratio. Preliminary research from Aclaris Medical sets the stage for successfully meeting the following Phase I aims to demonstrate feasibility: 1) Complete bench concept prototype, 2) Complete human evaluation of bench concept, and 3) Complete integrated prototype. The research team, led by Mark Bly, has successfully developed and commercialized ambulatory monitors for arrhythmia detection and heart failure patient monitoring in the past. Roger K. Pittman, MD; Scott P. Orr, PhD; Mark S. Greenberg, PhD; Jean C. Beckham, PhD; and Walton T. Roth, MD,experts in psychophysiological monitoring, will provide clinical advisement. The prototype made available by completion of the Phase I milestones will be able to collect a data set that has not been possible to date. The simplicity and tolerability of theproposed device will enable months of monitoring, improved compliance, and easier trial enrollment that can lead to advancements in PTSD research, screening, and treatment. The prototype will be refined, subjected to final testing, and employed in PTSD clinical research in Phase II. FDA approval will also be sought by Aclaris Medical in parallel to Phase II clinical activities. In Phase III, the company will seek to commercialize the device for mental health clinical research, particularly involving PTSD. Clinical research is expected to lead to larger commercial opportunities for the device such as the routine screening, monitoring, and treatment of PTSD or other mental health disorders and conditions, including panic disorder, phobias, generalized anxietydisorder, depressive disorders, and overall life stress. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its consequences place a large burden on the public and on the individuals who suffer from it, yet the clinical evaluationof PTSD is limited by its dependence on the subjective self-report of patients. Ambulatory physiological monitoring could aid in the research, screening, and treatment of PTSD, but current tools are too cumbersome to feasibly monitor the relevant parameters during a patient's daily life. The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate ad commercialize an ambulatory PTSD monitor that can measure relevant physiological parameters over long periods of time without disrupting the patient's life."

The proposed technology uses an innovative electrochemical design for water treatment. This practice reduces costs (e.g., transport, treatment, permitting) associated with hazardous waste and fresh water supplies, while safeguarding communities and the environment from potential contamination through accidental release, incomplete treatment, or non-secure storage. Industries adopting zero-liquid discharge can reduce freshwater demand and redirect it for other critical uses, such as agriculture. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will advance the development of an electrochemical oxidation and reduction destruction technology for industrial and municipal water treatment. The proposed technology destroys contaminants in a single step using a reactive electrochemical membrane easily customized to the appropriate voltage and amperage to efficiently oxidize or reduce target contaminants in the water. This project will address the following objectives: 1) optimize efficacy and efficiency to destroy PFAS, 1,4-dioxane, nitrate, and perchlorate, 2) finalize large-scale device design, 3) develop a pilot system and explore the performance-cost trade space, and 4) iterate on system design. The impact of process conditions on treatment efficacy will be explored to optimize for low cost and energy efficiency. Verification and validation will take place with on-site brine treatment pilot testing, while characterizing performance relative to state-of-practice and exploring potential economies of scale.

They are unsatisfied with the high maintenance, long-term costs, and lack of comprehensive treatment capabilities of existing systems. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to optimize, demonstrate, and scale an electrochemical water purification system for residential point-of-entry application. Existing water purification systems are largely ineffective in comprehensively treating contaminants such as pathogens, toxic organics, and metals, and also require frequent maintenance which contributes to high costs and waste generation. To address these concerns, the treatment effectiveness, cost, and feasibility of treating water contaminated with pathogens and toxic organic compounds by the proposed electrochemical technology will be studied in laboratory and pilot scale applications. Design parameters will be optimized for highest treatment capability and lowest costs and maintenance needs. Prototypes will be scaled for pilot evaluation at flow rates for residential point-of-entry application and evaluated for robustness. The laboratory and pilot units will be evaluated for perfluorinated compound (PFC) removal consistent with NSF/ANSI P473 and for pathogen disinfection following EPA Purifier Standard Certification.

Breast cancer is one of the most diagnosed type of cancer and second leading cause of cancer-related death
among women in the U.S. Treatment remains challenging due to the heterogeneity and highly dynamic nature
of breast tumors. Although early detection through screening has largely contributed to a decline in breast
cancer-related mortality, tumor recurrence and metastasis still remain associated with poor prognosis. Once the
disease becomes metastatic, the median survival is around 12 to 15 months. But more alarming is the incidence
of the triple-negative subtype, the most aggressive type of breast cancer, in the younger population. Increasing
evidence identifies the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process as a potential contributor of metastasis in this
subtype. In fact, breast carcinoma cells that undergo EMT acquire invasive properties that contribute to the
formation of metastases. In addition, EMT results in increased expression of extracellular matrix proteins
including fibronectin that enhance tumor invasion, regulate cancer cell proliferation, and limit tumor cell
responsiveness to therapies. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify novel molecular targets in breast
cancer-associated EMT, and develop new therapeutics to prevent triple-negative breast cancer progression
through metastasis. In our previous published research we observed a loss of connexin43 (Cx43) gap junctions
at the plasma membrane concomitantly with an increase in intracellular Cx43 expression during EMT. Despite
several studies in the field, the role of Cx43 in breast cancer remains ambiguous with roles in suppressing tumor
growth as well as facilitating tumor progression and metastasis. Our preliminary research identifies a tumorigenic
role for Cx43 in EMT and triple-negative cancer cells through its interaction with microtubules. Regulating
localization and activity of Cx43 is associated with the multiple sites for proteinâprotein interaction within the
Cx43 carboxy-terminus (CT). The Cx43 CT includes a tubulin binding domain and we developed a novel Cx43
mimetic peptide named JM2 (juxtamembrane 2) composed of the Cx43 CT encompassing the microtubule
binding sequence. Our goal is to assess the therapeutic effect of JM2 to target triple-negative breast cancer in
cell-based assays in vitro and in metastatic breast cancer mouse models in vivo. Our proposed research aims
to validate Cx43 as a novel molecular target in triple-negative breast cancer, and use JM2 to disrupt Cx43-
microtubule interaction without affecting Cx43 expression, thus regulating Cx43 localization and activity more
specifically. This proposal aims to fill a gap in knowledge, whereby no previous studies evaluated the tumorigenic
role of Cx43 through interaction with microtubules in breast cancer cells and no efficient targeted therapeutics
currently exist that can successfully ablate the metastatic potential of triple-negative breast cancer cells.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Breast cancer remains the second cause of cancer-related death for women in the US. Breast cancer
progression through metastasis is mediated by the transition of carcinoma cells into cancer cells with increased
invasive characteristics capable of escaping the primary tumor to colonize distant sites. This proposal will
evaluate the therapeutic potential of a peptide to decrease the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells and
prevent breast cancer progression."

Glioblastoma GBM is one of the most lethal incurable human diseases Even with aggressive therapies
including surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy using temozolomide TMZ  the median
survival for GBM patients is onlymonths In fact GBM cancer cells are highly infiltrative and comprise a sub
population of glioma stem cells GSCs with tumorigenic properties regulated by the tumor microenvironment
and often resistant to chemotherapy and irradiation treatments The remaining GSCs can then enter an active
state of self renewal and asymmetric division that recapitulates the heterogeneous tumor As a result all treated
GBM patients will experience tumor recurrence and subsequent surgeries and toxic radiotherapy and
chemotherapy regimens are harmful for the patient and often remain insufficient There is therefore an urgent
need for new therapeutic drug to target GSCs and treat this devastating disease Glioblastoma resistance to
TMZ correlates with the expression of the gap junction protein ConnexinCx a protein which enables
communication between cells and increased levels of Cx  are observed in GSCs The function of Cxis not
limited to forming channels for the passage of ions and small molecules between cells but also participates in
cell proliferation migration and apoptosis Therefore targeting Cx  activity holds promise to treat GBM and
prevent tumor recurrence In this proposed research we use a novel Cx  mimetic peptide named JM

that JM alters Cx  binding to microtubule decreases the formation of Cx  gap junctions and inhibits cell
cell communication in GSCs Most importantly we reveal the therapeutic potential of JM in decreasing GSC
survival in vitro and in vivo With the goal of developing a new therapy based upon JM to target GSCs in GBM
our overall objective is to generate JM loaded polyanhydride biodegradable nanoparticles JM NPs for
sustained delivery of JM to GSCs We will use high resolution microscopy techniques including stochastic
optical reconstruction microscopy STORM and biochemistry assays to analyze the effect of JM NPs in GSCs
derived from human primary GBM cells freshly isolated from dissected patient tumor Finally we will assess the
therapeutic effect of JM NPs on GSCs ex vivo using a three dimensional patient GBM derived organoid model
and in vivo using an orthotopic GBM mouse model These results will validate the potent effect of JM peptide
for treatment of high Cx  chemoresistant GSCs and present a therapeutic opportunity to prevent GBM tumor
recurrence The proposed research is significant because this innovative approach will not only allow us to
develop novel therapies for lethal GBM but also will lay foundation on potential clinical trials in newly diagnosed
GBM patients in the near future Finally our new JM loaded nanoparticles may be scalable to other CNS
diseases that could benefit from targeting Cx  microtubule interaction Project Narrative

Although most victims survive, the individual is often paralyzed for the rest of his or her life. Sixty percent of injuries occur in individuals between the ages of 16 and 30. Life-time medical costs average about $1.5 million dollars per patient and combined with lost earning potential make SCI a major burden both on an individual and national level. SCI results in permanent injury in part because neurons fail to regenerate through the glial scar that is formed after injury. This glial scar contains extracellular matrix molecules including chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). Chondroitinase ABCI [cABCI) is a bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of chondroitin sulfate carbohydrate chains such as those found on SPGs. Exciting recent work in animal models of SCI has shown that treatment with cABCI dramatically improves both motor and autonomic functional outcomes after injury. Although the benefits observed in animal models are significant and will likely translate to the human condition, chondroitinase therapies are challenged by the relative thermal instability of cABCI at body temperatures. The short enzyme halflife necessitates frequent dosing, limiting the size of animal trials and making human therapy challenging as well. A cABCI enzyme with increased stability at body temperatures will greatly facilitate research and make human therapies safer, easier and more cost effective by allowing use of indwelling pumps and sustained release formulations rather than repeated intrathecal injections. Phase 1 of this grant is designed to improve the thermal stability of cABCI to make it a more useful agent and potential human therapeutic. Given success during this initial work, phase 2 will advance the lead candidate into animal efficacy and preclinical development. Thermal stability of cABCI will be improved through VerdiZyme&#039;s Directed Gene Assembly (DGA) technology. This directed evolution (DE) approach has been used previously to increase the thermal stability of numerous enzymes. In this proposal, techniques drawn from several of these successful DE experiments will be used to construct variants of the cABCI enzyme with increased thermal stability through (i) knawledge-based-rational protein redesign, (ft) random mutagenesis, and (Hi) separation of advantageous and detrimental mutations through-recombination. Variants will be screened for enhanced thermal stability and reassorted for optimization with DGA. Lead candidates will be purified-and characterized. The aims of this proposal are 1) Produce a library of up to 100,000 chondroitinase mutants 2) Screen library for enhanced chondroitinase .thermal stability, 3) Re-assort identified aEeles to isolate advantageous combinations and 4) Purify and characterize chondroitinase product candidates."

Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans (CSPGs) an important component of the glial scar. The majority are potently inhibitory for axonal growth and hence contribute to the failure of these axons to regenerate and form functional synapses following SCI. Chondroitinase, a bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of CSPGs, has been shown to improve motor and sensory function and enhance regeneration following SCI in various studies. It also re-establishes a period of plasticity in the ocular dominance columns when injected in the parenchyma of the visual cortex.  Physical therapy in the form of various exercise paradigms, such as treadmill training or swimming has shown to improve functional recovery in both clinical and experimental settings. These training paradigms have been accompanied by increases in the levels of expression of neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin 3 (NT-3) and neurotrophin 4 (NT-4). There is also evidence in the literature supporting instrumental learning and plasticity in the spinal cord.  Based on recent evidence comparing various training paradigms that involve either rhythmicity and/or load on recovery of sensory function, we wanted to examine the effects of acute treatment of Chondroitinase combined with training in the forceps compression model of SCI. Results of these experiments will help us understand the effects of different types of training alone and in combination with Chondroitinase on various functional and histological outcome measures. The ultimate goal is to develop Chondroitinase as a potential therapeutic for the treatment of SCI and examine its potential role in the population of patients undergoing various types of physical therapy on a routine basis."

Following SCI, limited regeneration of injured neurons results in permanent disability characterized by some loss of sensation, paralysis and autonomic dysfunction. One reason that neurons fail to regenerate is their inability to traverse the glial scar that develops following SCI. This glial scar contains extracellular matrix molecules including chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). In vitro studies show that neurons fail to extend processes over CSPG coated surfaces, while in vivo data correlate failure of regeneration with areas of CSPG expression. Chondroitinase ABCI is a bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of chondroitin sulfate carbohydrate chains such as those found on CSPG. Chondroitinase treatment was found to improve functional outcome following surgical lesion of the dorsal column / cortico-spinal pathways in rodents. In addition, Chondroitinase was found to restore a period of plasticity in the visual cortex of rodents. We have recently demonstrated that Chondroitinase ABC I treatment improves open-field locomotor function and autonomic function in a contusion SCI model. Although the effects in animal models are significant, clinically relevant improvements in neurological function following SCI may require combinatorial therapies. For example, Chondroitinase treatment may be combined with an inhibitor of NOGO such as the decoy NOGO receptor (NgR) to promote regeneration. The objective of this grant proposal is to combine Chondroitinase with NgR at the genetic level to create a bi-functional therapeutic protein (Chase-NgR). In addition to providing combinatorial therapy with a single drug the affinity of the NgR for myelin associated inhibitors would confer a targeting mechanism to Chase-NgR wherein Chondroitinase treatment is focused on inhibitor rich regions in the CNS. In addition, we have shown that Chondroitinase facilitates diffusion into the CMS presumably by creating pathways for diffusion via digestion of CSPG. Therefore, Chondroitinase segment of Chase-NgR may promote diffusion of the NgR into the parenchyma of the CNS to a much greater extent than can be achieved without CSPG digestion. These studies will provide justification for a Phase II grant to fund further development of Chase-NgR as a therapeutic for SCI."

Treatment with bacterial chondroitinase (Chase), an enzyme that digests CSPG arbohydrate chains, decreases the CSPG inhibition, both in vitro and in vivo. Chase was recently used to treat spinal cord lesions in a rodent model, resulting in enhanced functional recovery. Several obstacles exist in the development of a Chase-based SCI therapy, including the delivery of a large protein to the central nervous system and the use of an enzyme with a short half-life in solution at body temperature. The aim of this study is to develop a sustained release (SR) formulation of a Chase therapy that can be delivered locally to the site of injury and demonstrate its effectiveness at digesting CSPGs in the rat spinal cord. To accomplish these goals are a repertoire of Chase enzymes will be cloned, expressed and purified. These enzymes will then be tested in vitro in several existing sustained release formulations. These sustained release Chase formulations will then be place in the sub-dural space of rat spinal cords to assess their ability to digest CSPGs in vivo. These studies will provide justification for a Phase II study examining the therapeutic effects of sustained release formulation of chondroitinase in an animal model of spinal cord injury."

The cost to society is enormous because most new cases occur in people under the age of 30 and these individuals have a near normal life expectancy. Therefore, the development of a new, effective therapy to treat SCI is imperative. We propose to use an established in vitro assay to screen antisense molecules for neural protection. Primary cultures of rat central nervous (CNS) tissue consisting of neurons, astrocytes, and microglial cells will be established. These mixed CNS cultures will be injured by addition of the cytokine IL- 1, glutamate or by mechanical injury. Taken together, these injuries mimic important aspects of SCI. Using current technology, antisense sequences will be designed and synthesized to inhibit the production of various proteins that have been shown to be involved in tissue damage following neural injury. These antisense sequences will be added to injured CNS cultures and neuroprotective activity will be assessed. As a result of this screening protocol, we expect to identify a small list of antisense molecules that demonstrate efficacy and warrant additional studies of equivalent human sequences in the appropriate pre-clinical models of SCI. Ultimately, we expect to identify a candidate molecule, which Acorda Therapeutics can take to human clinical trials for the treatment of SCI and related conditions. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The financial cost for the care of patients with spinal cord injury and neurodegenerative diseases in the US alone has been estimated to be in excess of $90 billion annually. Any therapeutic agent developed and commercialized as a result of this proposal will have a profound, positive impact on the lives of patients with neurodegenerative disease."

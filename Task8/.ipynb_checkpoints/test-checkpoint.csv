,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Project Summary:OneCyte Biotechnologies, Inc. is a spin-out from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
advancing next-generation single-cell technologies to impact drug development and bio-manufacturing.
OneCyte is a pioneer of single-cell proteomics and is developing a platform technology that cuts many
months off biologic (e.g. therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) or vaccines) drug development. A
key challenge in biopharma are slow bio-manufacturing timelines. The world is currently experiencing the
impact of slow development timelines on human health and the economy in the extreme example of the
COVID-19 pandemic and its burden of rapidly developing and manufacturing billions of doses of novel
vaccines and MAbs. This is highlighting the need for accelerated drug development and manufacturing.OneCyte's single-cell platform technology provides insight into cell biology at an unprecedented
scale; potentially enabling new classes of therapeutics, and enhancing basic scientific understandings.
The impact of this technology will be reducing time and cost of pharmaceutical development, as well as
improving efficacy and safety. This can enable developing new drugs for currently untreatable and rare
diseases, which are presently not feasible to develop or manufacture. Beyond this initial application,
OneCyte's technology could become a readily implemented research tool, enhancing the basic
understanding of biology, or facilitating engineering of cell function for cell therapy applications.OneCyte is seeking funding to expand the innovative single-cell analytical capabilities and screen
for additional critical product quality attributes (PQAs) important for drug safety and efficacy, as well as
transition the single-cell technology platform to a commercial process by the end of SBIR Phase II.In Aim 1. OneCyte will develop and implement innovative single-cell assays for additional PQAs,
focusing on screening for undesired deviations in drug manufacturability, which lead to reduced drug
circulating half-life and reduced production yield.In Aim 2. OneCyte will automate and scale-up single-cell data analytics towards improved
predictivity for drug manufacturability, as well as automate the pipeline for commercial data analytics with
the necessary minimum user input.In Aim 3. OneCyte will develop a manufacturing ready thermoplastic microfluidic chip, replacing
an elastomeric material. Validation of the new plastic chips for use in the single-cell process will be
performed by testing cell performance compared to elastomeric chips.Project Narrative:
The cell line development process is a critical bottleneck in biologics manufacturing as it is time consuming and
labor intensive. OneCyte's goal is to translate its proprietary high throughput single-cell proteomics platform to
revolutionize cell line development by significantly reducing the time and effort for cell line selection. Accelerating
biologics manufacturing will have direct impact on patient access to novel therapeutics."

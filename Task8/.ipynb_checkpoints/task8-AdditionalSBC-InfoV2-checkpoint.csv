Soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines; SCN) is the major pathogen of soybean causing over $1 billion in crop losses annually. SCN is now considered endemic to North America and is spreading as more acres of land are planted in soybean. Widely prevalent strategies for SCN management include crop rotation and the use of resistant soybean cultivars. These approaches have met with only limited success in reducing the populations of parasitic nematodes in the field. The recent loss of SCN resistance in Ohio-grown soybean highlights the importance of generating new methods for SCN control such as biocontrol. Examples of biocontrol with nematicidal activity are found in the scientific literature including numerous strains of bacteria. However, commercial applications by the large seed companies are limited to spore-forming Bacillus strains. While these spore-formers have some limited ability to survive conventional on-seed application processes and supply chain conditions, they can be limited in their effectiveness against target pests. Environmental stress and abuse associated with manufacturing and distribution typically results in microorganism death and/or dormancy, which decrease viability and physiological activity of the microorganism at the time of application. Thus, current microbial products have decreased effectiveness and reliability.3Bar Biologics is creating a disruptive new system to deliver beneficial microorganisms - a low cost, disposable bioreactor that protects the microorganisms until the farmer is ready to activate the product prior to application. On-site growth of the beneficial microorganisms short-cuts the conventional supply chain, resulting in fresher, more viable microorganisms delivered to the field. This bioreactor opens up the potential for farmers to apply more effective microorganism strains with SCN control capability.The work plan addresses three technical objectives to create a functional prototype for commercialization of strains with demonstrated activity on SCN, to i) maximize cellular yields in the device with a number of proven beneficial strains, ii) characterize stability and compatibility of new formulations, and iii) evaluate efficacy against SCN in the field.This project is directly aligned with USDA NIFA Challenge Area 1) Global Food Security, and Priority 8.2.4) to research biobased approaches for plant protection against abiotic and biotic stresses.",43206-0000,brucecaldwell@mac.com

Despite recent advances, prostate cancer mortality still remains high due to the emergence of therapy-resistant cancer cells that metastasize. This lack of effective therapies against metastatic cancer exists, at least in part, because of lack of drug screening platforms that address the unique nature of metastastatic prostate cancer cells and their microenvironment. Recently, our collaborators havefound that prostate cancer (PCa) cells act as molecular parasites as they metastasize to bone and harvest resources from the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche environment where they stay dormant and resistant to conventional anti-cancer drugs. If the dormant metastasized PCa cells that parasitize the HSC niche could be recreated in vitro, they would serve as ideal platforms to screen specifically for anti-metastatic PCa drugs. We have recently shown that 3D co-culture spheroids can mimic the PCa cell parasitized HSC niche thereby maintaining PCa cells in a physiological, more quiescent state. What is required to take advantage of the metastatic PCa microtissue engineering capability we have acquired for drug screening applications is to develop a high throughput format of these types of co-culture spheroids. Towards this end, this Phase I STTR proposal will: Aim 1: Validate a 384 array hanging drop plate system for preparation of the co-culture spheroids. This is a major focus of 3-D Biomatrix, LLC. We have already modified our published platform (Tung et al. 2011) to: enhance droplet stability, facilitate pipette tip insertin, mitigate evaporation, and preserve sterility during optical analysis (Figure 1A). We will perform high throughput performance validations for fluorescence, transmitted light, and bioluminescence assays (Z'- factor), and further refine the design as necessary. Aim 2: Create arrays of microengineered 3D tissues of bone metastasized PCa in the quiescent state. This will be the focus of the Takayama lab at the University of Michigan. To develop procedures to utilize the 384 array hanging drop plate to form co-culture spheroids of PCa cells, marrow stromal cells (MSCs), and human bone marrow endothelial cells (HBMECs) similar to those prepared previously in low throughput microfluidic devices. We will also confirm quiescence of the PCa cells in these co-culture spheroids. The biological hypothesis that motivates this study is: We can treat metastatic PCa better by developing drugs that specifically target dormant metastatic PCa cells that are parasitizing the HSC niche.

This SBIR Phase I proposal is to demonstrate the scaffold manufacturing feasibility by using a proprietary precision extruding deposition technique to fabricate porous 3D tissue scaffold with controlled porosity and internal architecture, and then coated the scaffold with a cell culture derived extracellular matrix (ECM) by using cell culture technology. We hypotheze that this cell culture derived biomimetic ECM coating, after proper decellularization and treatment, can offer similar biological performance as conventional tissue derived ECM in tissue engineering application. Toward this goal, we would like to demonstrate that an ECM coating can be generated onto the surface of porous tissue scaffolds. To achieve this aim, we first apply an enabling precision extruding deposition technique to freeformly fabricate porous 3D polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds with various porous structures. We then apply cell culture method to produce two types of ECM coatings using human dermal fibroblasts and human mesenchymal stem cells (under osteogeneic differentiation). We would like to further demonstrate that the decellularized biomimetic ECM coatings derived from two different cell lines (fibroblast and mesenchymal stem cells under osteogeneic differentiation) will affect osteo-differentiation of re-seeded mesenchymal stem cells. More specifically, we would like to demonstrate that the osteo- differentiated mesenchymal stem cells derived ECM coating could be used as a better ECM substrate for re-seeded mesenchymal stem cell in terms of the cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation down to the osteogeneic lineage.

Atomically precise crystal growth will be used to produce a new generation of ultra-thin single- crystal semiconductor-metal quantum heterostructures. These atomically precise heterostructures will enable new levels of performance in optoelectronic devices such as high sensitivity photodetectors, high gain and radiation hard electronic devices such as heterojunction bipolar transistors, and superconducting quantum interference devices that are used in advanced quantum computers.

Current in vitro methods for characterizing gastrointestinal absorption are based on unreliable assays, with 90% of all drugs developed ultimately failing to enter the market. Practically, these limitations delay the development of critically needed therapeutic drugs and dramatically increase drug prices and health care costs. There is, therefore, a critical need to develop more predictive in vitro testing assays that will allow for early selection of the most promising drug candidates to reduce the number of live animal studies and their associated costs, while accelerating transition from pre-clinical research to early drug development. The technology is based on the discovery, fundamental characterization and bioarchiving of adult canine intestinal stem cell lines, called 3-dimensional (3D) canine intestinal organoids. These miniguts emulate the physiology of the functional intestine much more closely than currently available methods and have the potential to provide superior drug screening over currently used assays. This SBIR Phase I is a proposal to establish that in vitro predictability of oral drug absorption can be improved using canine intestinal organoids vs. standard 2D in vitro assays, such as Caco2 and MDCK cell lines. In Aim 1, the goal is to determine intestinal absorption and permeability of therapeutic drugs as a function of disease and intestinal segment as compared with conventional in vitro models. This will be achieved by quantifying passive and active permeability of drugs, as well as drug transporter expression and function in 3D canine organoids vs. conventional cell systems. In Aim 2, the goal is to determine intestinal metabolism of therapeutic drugs as a function of disease and intestinal segment in canine organoids compared to standard in vitro models. Ultimately, quantitative data generated through these experiments will be imported into a commercial software to simulate the disposition kinetics of a predefined set of candidate drugs. Performances of the model predictions will be evaluated by comparing simulated vs. observed drug kinetic plasma data from the literature for validation purposes.

This project will enable rapid manufacturing of customized microfluidics devices with substantially lower costs and turnaround times. This technology will impact research in applications including fundamental cell biology, drug screening, cellular therapy, toxicity testing, and tissue engineering.

Current metal AM platforms use expensive core components and consumable materials in high-priced machines that produce 99.9% dense parts. The proposed project introduces a lower performance, affordable stainless steel additive manufacturing technology that will be capable of satisfying the vast majority of customer needs for industrial grade stainless steel parts. The vast majority of the market simply cannot afford to take advantage of AM benefits due to the high costs associated with current technologies. This proposal re-examines the material performance, machine cost and reliability requirements necessary for a novel metal AM system. The goal of the proposal is to allow an estimated 50,000+ American manufacturers to capitalize on the benefits of AM and compete to win in an ultra-competitive, highly globalized manufacturing industry. Furthermore, the proposed invention of a low-cost machine allows for unprecedented scalability in metal AM, allowing smaller manufacturers to compete with the resources of large conglomerates. This research has broad implications in many industries and is considered to be fundamentally enabling for the growth and prosperity of American manufacturing. The proposed project re-examines the need for high technology, high cost core components in currently available commercial metallic AM machines. Through an innovative deconstruction of the inkjet print head-based, binder jetting process, a method for producing metal end-use parts has been created. The proposed process is based on a novel combination of two low cost and established technologies. The creation of a robust prototype with this novel method is a highly challenging, multi-faceted project involving key advances in materials science through the development of a novel binder system compatible with the new process as well as a fundamental evaluation and improvement of material properties of the as-built parts. In addition, re-designed sintering cycles and development of software prediction algorithms to anticipate shrinkage characteristics will be core challenges to overcome in order to achieve the tight tolerances manufacturing partners require. As such, these challenges will require tight cross-disciplinary collaboration for a meaningful outcome.

Two million Americans develop skin cancer every year and one in five Americans will be diagnosed with the condition in his or her lifetime. With better skin monitoring, skin cancer can be diagnosed in the earlier and more treatable stages, leading to improved patient outcomes and lower treatment costs. The proposed technology consists of an easy to use imager and web interface that allows patients to take clinical quality 2D and 3D images from the comfort of their homes. These images are uploaded automatically to a web interface and are analyzed to track changes in size and color. The images are also displayed for the dermatologist to review and monitor remotely. The project aims to build, test, and review our next generation prototype. After manufacturing a small number of imagers, a study will be conducted to test their effectiveness as a home monitoring system. Feedback from the dermatologists and patients who use the system will be used to improve the early prototype and prepare for commercialization. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the system?s expected ability to make teledermatology practical. This can revolutionize the current standard of dermatological care by allowing dermatologists to diagnose patients quickly and inexpensively. Dermatologists currently use magnifying lenses and digital cameras to image patients? skin lesions, but these methods do not have the capability to take standardized images and log them over time. More advanced equipment exists but is too expensive and complicated for patient use. The technology will capture an untapped market for a low cost skin monitoring solution that automatically creates electronic patient histories. Such a system could be of use in rural or remote areas, including developing countries, where dermatological care is unavailable or substandard. Additionally, the system can create a large database of de-identified images and case files from consenting patients.

Target applications are wide- ranging-facial recognition for identification; simulation for training and educational purposes; the animation industry for movies; and medical diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome assessment for patients with congenital abnormalities, dentofacial disharmonies, facial trauma, and neurological problems. These patients have facial disabilities and require treatment to improve their facial soft tissue esthetics and movement. They would benefit from objective measures and facial feature analysis to assist doctors in determining their treatment plan. We have extensive experience with dynamic objective measures used to examine the effects of surgery on circumoral function in patients with cleft lip and palate. 3dMD and Dr. Trotman will use these patients for the proof of concept and technology-development proposed here. The Specific Aims are as follows. Phase I (Static). 1) To collect age- and gender- stratified 3D facial images from patients with diagnosed facial disfigurement and from control subjects with no known facial problems. Using these images as a basis, develop and validate algorithms that will enable differentiation between disfigured and non-disfigured faces; 2) To develop algorithms for the automatic extraction of 3D facial image features; 3) From the extracted facial surface data, develop objective 3D criteria that will allow a quantification of the differences between facial images of patients with facial disfigurements and those with no known facial disfigurements; and 4) To evaluate the 3D image-based facial analysis system for use in a clinical setting. Phase II (Dynamic). 1) To collect age- and gender-stratified 4D dynamic facial images taken at 60 frames per second from patients with diagnosed facial impairment and control subjects with no known facial problems. From these images, develop and validate algorithms that will enable differentiation between patients with impaired movement and normal 'non-impaired' subjects; 2) To extend the surface extraction algorithms and software developed in Phase I of the program to the automatic extraction of facial features from 4D dynamic images; and 3) To refine the development of 3dMD's 4D Dynamic Face capture system for the analysis of dynamic surface movement and to evaluate the system for use in a clinical setting.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will provide a product that produces objective measures to evaluate patients with congenital abnormalities, dentofacial disharmonies, facial trauma, and neurological problems.

 Specific Aims
Additive manufacturing AM is increasingly being used in the medical for applications as diverse as printing
prosthesis and implants of ceramic and metallic materials and even organs using soft materials and live tissue
 bioprinting  In AM a computer aided design CAD file is processed and sent to a D printer to print the
desired shape which reduces time and cost compared to the traditional polymer or metal working methods
Figure a presents an example of a mandibular reconstruction plate design and Figure b shows the D
printed plate for fixation in a patient s jaw This exciting new manufacturing method comes with new
challenges All steps of the AM process chain including the final printing step are based on software programs
and are exposed to cybersecurity threats Stolen CAD files can be used to print parts of a exactly the same
quality as the original component and make it difficult to separate originals from counterfeits or b exactly the
same geometry but with inferior materials which may not have the same performance
Given the cybersecurity scenario that even the
most protected federal government assets and
corporations have been breached recently it is
likely that the designs developed by biomedical
researchers and companies are exposed to the
same risks In the biomedical and medical fields
inferior components can pose significant risk to
the health and wellbeing of the patient The
stolen CAD files can make their way to countries
where neither intellectual property protections a  b
are strong nor tracking of implants is possible FigureA mandibular reconstruction plate  a a CAD model

features in the CAD files so that the parts
 School of Medicine
printed from the stolen CAD files can be identified The project is based on a new design methodology
developed by the PI Zeltmann and co PI Gupta which is now patent pending and formed the basis for
establishing DP Security Inc for its commercialization This new methodology takes advantage of the layer
by layer manufacturing of AM processes and has potential for developing security features that will be invisible
to unsuspecting people In the presence of such features the component will print in high quality only under a
pre determined set of conditions while any other condition will result in a severely defective component that
will be unsuitable for use This design methodology is used in the present proposal to print identification codes
in the genuine implants
Specific Aim
An identification code will be embedded in the mandibular implant A process will be developed so that the
embedded code can be printed in the material only under certain file processing conditions for D printing All
other processing conditions will ignore the presence of the code This scheme will also help in identification of
genuine products from counterfeits which may have been printed from stolen files and possibly using inferior
quality materials The code will be sliced into several sections and embedded in different layers of the material
by taking advantage of the layer by layer manufacturing process Such possibilities are unique to additive
manufacturing and do not exist in other traditional manufacturing methods such as casting and forging
Mechanical tests will be conducted to ensure that the embedded code does not compromise the quality of the
product in any way Tensile tests will be conducted on the specimens to determine the properties of the implant
with and without the embedded codes
Specific Aim
A software utility will be developed that will take the STL files of the implant design as inputs and embed the
security code in them This utility will first generate a desired tracking code slice this code into several parts
and then embed it in the STL file in such a way that each slice of the code prints in a different layer in the
implant The Phase I effort will demonstrate the utility developed in MATLAB The utility will take into account
the D printing technology used for that product and the processing parameter in order to develop the desired
embedding scheme Additive manufacturing AM is increasingly being used in the medical for applications as
diverse as printing prosthesis and implants of ceramic and metallic materials and even organs
using soft materials and live tissue bioprinting  The present proposal is based on embedding a
tracking code in the CAD files used for AM so that the genuine and counterfeit products can be

The geometric complexity, mechanical properties, and cost competitiveness for small lot production make AM techniques particularly suited for Ti-6Al-4V aircraft applications. However, microstructural and material property variability issues inherent to AM make rapid qualification of metal AM parts difficult. 3DSIM has significant experience with thermal modeling of metal laser sintering of Ti64, including prediction of Ti64 phases and phase transitions. These models have been validated experimentally over several years of research at the University of Louisville. To fully predict microstructural evolution in Ti64, accurate prediction of the initial crystal microstructure and subsequent solid state phase transitions is required. However, accurate prediction of initial microstructure is difficult to validate using Ti64 due to solid state phase transformations. To address Phase I objectives, 3DSIM proposes to: develop algorithms which predict microstructural characteristics, including phase evolution, grain size and grain orientation, from metal AM thermal histories; conduct validation of the predicted microstructural characteristics by comparison with as-built microstructures for metal laser sintered CoCrMoC parts; and conduct validation of the predicted microstructural characteristics by comparison with as-built microstructures for LENS-deposited Ti64 parts.",84089,deepankar.pal@3dsim.com

Percutaneous transluminal artery (PTA) treatment of severe PAD involves the use of balloons and stents, but delivery of these therapies is often suboptimal due to inaccuracies in angiographic assessment of vessel size or a lack of proper functional vessel assessment. Additional tools aid clinicians in accurately determining vessel size and function, but these are often unused because of the added time, cost, training, and interpretation required. Guidewires are used in every interventional procedure, so the ability of a guidewire to provide not only a stable platform for therapy delivery, but also a diagnostic tool for vessel structure and function would bevaluable. We have developed a fully functional 0.035 LumenRECON (LR) guidewire that has the same mechanical properties as a standard Wholey workhorse guidewire, but also uses electrical impedance technology to assess vessel lumen size and stenosis pressure drop. Thus, the guidewire provides a 3-in-1 functionality (i.e. one workhorse guidewire that acts as a platform for therapy delivery, vessel sizing, and stenosis pressure drop assessment). In this Phase I proposal, we will perform a pre-clinical study tovalidate the functionality of our 0.035 LumenRECON (LR) guidewire as a standard workhorse guidewire for vessel navigation and an accurate diagnostic tool for luminal sizing and pressure drop measurements in large animals. To accomplish the Phase I objectives, the safety, along with accuracy and repeatability of the sizing (specific aim #1) and pressure drop (specific aim #2) measurements will be assessed in domestic swine and measured against current clinically used tools, such as intravascular ultrasound(IVUS), quantitative angiography (QA), and pressure wires. This proposal addresses the significant and growing national epidemic of PAD and addresses an area that is growing, yet often overlooked. Successful completion of the proposed Aims will allow us to translate our research findings into a device that could drastically improve the treatment of PAD.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Determination of arterial lumen size and function is critical, but often not assessed adequately during peripheral interventions. The objective of this Phase I SBIR is to validate a novel 0.035 workhorse-type guidewire that provides 3 in 1 functionality as a standard navigational system, as well as a tool for vessel sizing and stenosis pressure drop assessment.",46204-,wcombs@flowco-inc.com

The World Health Organization estimates over 1.6 billion adults (age 15+) are overweight, and at least 400 million are considered obese. In response, there has been increasing interest in the surgical treatment of morbid obesity with the application of laparoscopic techniques. Our major objective is to establish the safety and efficacy of a Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy, VSG-like device referred to as the gastric sleeve implant (GSI). The major advantage of GSI is that it does not require gastrectomy and hence leaves the anatomy and physiology of the stomach intact. Furthermore, the implant is reversible and can be removed if desired by the patient and physician. In phase I of this SBIR, we will focus on the validation of the GSI in an in vivo dog model. Therefore, our specific aim is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a reversible GSI for weight loss in a group of dogs. The device is designed to be implanted laparoscopically, and to be readily removed after implantation if desired, leaving the patient's anatomy healthy, intact, and physiologically normal. The net result of the GSI procedure is a vertical sleeve, or banana-shaped, food track, which is a fraction of the size of the original stomach. The stomach tissue excluded from the food track remains healthy and unharmed, but the digestive volume is restricted to limit the patient's food intake. The GSI mimics the benefits of the increasingly popular VSG, but it inherently avoids some of the shortcomings of the VSG and other commonly used bariatric procedures. These current procedures all suffer from one or more of the following shortcomings: 1) Leaks and complications, especially from staple lines; 2) Nutritional deficiencies from malabsortive therapies; 3) Frequent follow-up appointments for adjustments; and 4) Insufficient and/or unsustained weight loss amongst others. The design of the proposed GSI and our preliminary data address some of these shortcomings.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major objective of this proposal is to establish the safety and efficacy of an implant bariatric device.

The intent of this research is todevelop the necessary and sufficient connectivity to allow stable operation of a shipboard prognostic and health monitoring system and to formulate it as a dissipative system, able to recover from anomalies and disturbances without compromising missioncompliance. We propose to develop a system where dynamics and stability are predicated on changing optimality and that cooperating agents form the basis for such rational behavior. Furthermore, for a system of operating agents to be successful, acommunication architecture must be developed that allows for the free flow of data and information unencumbered by any spatial constraints.A successful approach will result in a blueprint for development of a robust, virtually indestructible network thatwill serve as a high-reliability communications link and sensor network for emergency and crisis management.

Loss of personnel, particularly those who represent the corporate history, is depleting the Navy of its valuable experiential base which has been so heavily relied on in the past.  These realizations are causing the Navy to rethink its condition-based maintenance policies, moving them away from reacting to equipment problems to taking a proactive approach to anticipate needs based on mission requirements. This SBIR will develop a new approach to condition-based maintanance-Context Dependent Prognostics and Health Assessment. This advanced diagnostics capability will be developed around a context dependent model that provides a capability to anticipate incipient system/element failures and determine machine performance over a protracted period of time.

In today's market place, the competitive capacity of an engineering firm is determined by its ability to rapidly design new products and evaluate new engineering solutions. Most engineering design firms use computer aided design software to accelerate this process. However, the productivity of CAD engineers is still bottlenecked by the user interface and the user input devices available to them. This is because many CAD tasks involve 3D manipulation, which is difficult and tedious to perform with a 2D mouse. A typical CAD user spends four to eight hours a day in CAD software. Over a million CAD users fit this profile. The proposed technology makes these users more productive by enabling them to directly manipulate virtual CAD objects with their bare hands in 3D, at their desks---a technical feat that has never before been achieved. The result is faster product and engineering design in a variety of industries including manufacturing, construction and architecture which spent $6B on CAD software in 2011. This research will advance scientific and technological understanding by creating a fundamentally new way to interact with computers for productivity applications.",94404-1745,rywang@threegear.com

Validating this new tracer as a glucose analogue for optical imaging of superficial tumors may have a major impact on clinical and preclinical imaging of superficial tumors. If this new tracer is shown to behave similarly to the 18-fluorine-labeled 2-deoxyglucose (FDG), which is becoming the gold standard for metabolic imaging of tumors by positron-emission topography (PET), we may change the way superficial tumors are detected and diagnosed and produce a low cost screening method for early detection of superficial tumors. This validation may also have a major impact on animal studies since it would be the only glucose analogue validation for metabolic imaging in small animals. The overall goal of the project is to validate first the use of 2-NBDG as a marker of malignant tumor cells (Phase I) and then to develop in vivo methods and fluorescence optical instrumentation, for commercialization, that can be used to\ economically monitor 2-NBDG uptake via simple optical instrumentation (Phase II). Two Specific Aims proposed for Phase I: 1) to assess and characterized the uptake properties of the fluorescent glucose analogue, 2-NBDG, in model malignant tumor cell lines and in normal, non-malignant cells in vitro using fluorescence microscopy and spectrofluorimetry to elucidate the kinetic properties of the 2-NBDG uptake process in selected model malignant tumor cell lines (three lines) and in normal, non-malignant cells, and 2) to validate the use of the fluorescent glucose analogue, 2-NBDG, as a probe to identify malignant tumor cells by directly comparing the uptake of 2-NBDG with the uptake of radiolabeled 2-dexoyglucose (an established ""gold"" standard), by radioisotopic analysis, in the same cell lines; and initial uptake in animal tissues. By comparing 2-NBDG uptake with that of the standard, radiolabeled analogue, the use of 2-NBDG as a reliable probe for each cell line will be validated. The end points for assessing successful completion of Phase I is the demonstration of uptake of 2-NBDG in tumor cells comparable to radiolabeled 2-deoxyglocose. Following a successful completion of this phase, we propose to study the feasibility of in-vivo imaging of 2-NBDG in mice models of superficial tumors, and develop instrumentation to detect these tumors non-invasively.",77478,roger.g.oneil@.uth.tmc.edu

Existing diagnostic systems require 2-6 days to identify the bacteria, which delays treatment using appropriate antibiotics. Sepsis, which is often caused by a bacterial infection, contributes to up to half of all hospital deaths in the US largely due to complications arising from delays or inappropriate treatment (which is mainly because of lack of information regarding the infection-causing bacteria). It is the most expensive hospital-treated condition in the United States ? representing $20.3 billion in healthcare costs. The proposed system aims to sharply reduce the time to provide information needed by physicians, enabling them to initiate treatment using the appropriate antibiotic rapidly. This is expected to lead to significant reductions in costs, complications, and mortality. Further, by eliminating the need for culturing, new insights into bacterial behavior can be acquired contributing to additional fundamental knowledge of bacteria. This knowledge will aid antibiotic discovery efforts, improve understanding of mechanisms of drug resistance, support new biomanufacturing processes through faster detection of bacterial contamination of pharmaceutical products and foods, and characterization of the microbiome. The challenges of rapid bacterial identification are primarily in two areas ? sample preparation, that eliminates the need for culturing, and multiplex identification, to cover the diverse range of bacterial species capable of causing infection. The proposed work is based on leveraging the differential response between bacteria and the cells in a sample matrix to selectively break down the sample matrix, but not bacteria, such that the largest lysis debris is smaller than intact bacteria. The debris is subsequently separated from intact bacteria using a size-based technique enabling rapid isolation of a broad range of bacteria directly from the sample. A novel Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy system is then used to identify the isolated bacteria at clinically relevant concentrations. No bacteria-specific reagents are employed. The proposed Phase I work addresses the highest risk technical hurdles in the process. Isolating and detecting low concentration of bacteria directly from blood is accomplished through the three objectives of this project that optimize the purification and bacterial recovery from the sample, identification accuracy, and performance of the integrated system relative to the traditional culturing-based method.

This nano-biosensor has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Many patients who experience chest pain, an early symptom of a heart attack (myocardial infarction, MI), are first seen by EMS (emergency medical services) and are transported to a hospital in an ambulance. EMS are equipped with electrocardiogram (EKG) devices, but approximately 40% of all heart attacks cannot be diagnosed with an EKG alone. This leads to longer wait times for a definitive diagnosis, causes difficulty for patient transport decisions, delays treatment for those experiencing a true MI, and causes unnecessary hospital admissions for patients who are later found not to have had a heart attack. Blood-based biomarker assays, which are currently not performed in a prehospital setting, are needed to reach a conclusive diagnosis for all heart attack types. A portable device to monitor troponin T in a prehospital setting would result in faster treatment via improved diagnosis, better routing of patients to appropriate medical centers, and a decrease in unnecessary hospital stays. The cardiac biomarker market, including troponin, is expected to grow to $9.9 billion by 2022. The innovation of the proposed technology lies in the metal nanostructures on the diagnostic chip. These nanostructures allow proteins to be delivered to the sensing area and detected in a high sensitivity manner, while excluding larger debris, such as blood cells. The proposed work will leverage optical techniques for real-time label-free detection of protein biomarkers at the nanostructured chip. The current method for manufacturing the detection chips is slow and uneconomical. This Phase I work will address the high-risk, high-reward technical challenges by creating a low-cost, high-throughput fabrication method to mass manufacture nanostructured chips with reproducible optical properties. Additionally, this Phase I work seeks to validate blood sample delivery to the sensing area and troponin T detection in blood using an integrated microfluidic device. The selectivity and specificity requirements will be addressed by attachment of custom DNA molecules to the sensing area. These pieces of DNA are designed to bind in a highly specific manner to troponin T only. The outcomes of this Phase I project will establish the scientific and technical foundations necessary to move into a Phase II project by developing a low cost and easy to use point-of-care device suitable for rapid prehospital diagnosis of heart attacks.

These expensive voyages can cost several tens of thousands of dollars per day. Solar and wind power can recharge batteries, but harvested power is limited and each source has shortcomings. Wave energy operates when the sun does not shine and could provide additional power, but the few commercial systems available generally cost far too much for oceanography applications. Furthermore, even when sufficient power is available, growth of unwanted organisms (biofouling) on oceanographic sensors still necessitates expensive ship voyages to replace sensors on buoys. The company has designed a compact, low-power and relatively inexpensive wave energy converter to provide power for a variety of marine applications. This device can also power ultraviolet light-emitting diodes to inhibit biofouling on sensors. The marine research institute partner operates arrays of offshore buoys. In order to function for longer periods of time between ship visits, these buoys will need both additional power and inhibition of biofouling. The company and its partner will work together to adapt the wave energy converter technology to operate on buoys in an existing array. The Company will also develop an ultraviolet source to prevent biofouling on the marine research institute partnerâs sensors. Phase I work will establish feasibility, mechanical design of the new wave energy converter, and optical and electrical design of the ultraviolet source. While the two systems will be designed to work together, the wave energy converter and anti-biofouling source will each be able to operate without the other. During Phase I, the company will work with marine buoy engineering experts at the marine research institute partner to develop and optimize a model for wave energy conversion based on real-time motion data from existing buoys and prior conversion efficiency measurements made on the companyâs prototype. Drawing on deep experience in light emitting diodes, including for disinfection, the company will build ultraviolet source modules and run experiments in a lab and at a dock to determine operating parameters (wavelength, optical power density and duty cycle) required to prevent biofouling in a cost- effective manner. An electrical engineering consultant with a strong background in control systems will develop a block diagram for optimal power extraction from the wave energy converter, as well as design anti-biofouling source electronics. The marine research institute partner needs to prevent biofouling on its 600 sensors that are deployed down to 200 m depth. Other oceanography buoys are expected to produce a market at least an order of magnitude larger. More generally, a small, cost-effective wave energy converter could be used in a wide range of marine applications, including aquaculture, aids to navigation, offshore wind environmental monitoring, defense and security, environmental monitoring, communications, and other areas of oceanography and meteorology. Market Watch predicts that the powered data buoy market will reach over 45,000 units globally by 2022. This wave energy converter technology can be scaled up to higher powers as well, opening further opportunities.",94028-7934,jefouquet@outlook.com

Although vaccinations for the prevention of cervical cancer have been developed, the current vaccine has a high cost, targets only two-thirds of HPV strains, and is effective only when administered prior to HPV infection. In the U.S. alone, 1.2 million cases of low-grade CIN and 0.2-0.3 million casesof high-grade CIN are diagnosed annually; yet, no FDA- approved drug therapies are available for its treatment. For women diagnosed with low-grade CIN, the standard approach is  watchful waiting;  women with high-grade CIN are treated with the loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). Despite this treatment, a significant recurrence rate of high-grade CIN occurs. What is needed is a medical treatment option for resolving these lesions during the early stages of CIN. Project Goal and Technological Innovation. This project will develop continuous-release implants, containing a natural compound - specifically withaferin A - for the prophylactic treatment of high-risk patients with cervical cancer and other cervical pathologies. The implant to be used at the target site, promises a significant advance in cancer prevention and treatment. Natural compounds administered orally are often accompanied by limited bioavailability while chemotherapeutics administered intravenously result in undesirable large spikes in the blood. The development of polymeric implants to provide continuous delivery of therapeutic agents directly to the target site would substantially lower its effective dose, and minimize toxicity concerns generally associated with high oral and i.v. doses. The main objective of this project is to optimize polymeric implants ( cervical inserts ) for continuous ( 24/7 ) release of withaferin A at the target site (ie., the cervix) using a large animal model, the goat. The studies described represent the necessary pre-clinical efforts to examine potential toxicity and rate of release of withaferin A from the cervical implants. In addition, the concept of continuous local delivery of cancer chemopreventives is a novel and innovative concept that has the potential to revolutionize the clinical management of high-risk individuals. The new, patient-friendly device would be an economic treatment. Furthermore, prophylactic treatment with natural compounds delivered locally may obviate the need for LEEP.The implant delivery device is currently under a pending patent, with one of the PIs (Dr. Gupta) as the inventor. Hypothesis and Specific Aims. We hypothesize that withaferin A, a triterpenoid, which has no known toxicity and has significant antiproliferative and anti-viral activities against human cervical cancer cells in vitro and in viv, when embedded in polymeric implants, will be released continuously at the target site for extended periods, and that no tissue or systemic toxicity associated with either the drug or the polymeric materials will be produced. The specific aims are to (1) optimize the formulation of polymeric cervical inserts and determine rate of drug release in vitro; and (2) using a large animal (goat) model, determine, the rate of drugrelease from cervical inserts, any systemic and tissue toxicity, and the levels of the drug in plasma, and local, surrounding and distal tissues. Future efforts will involve examining still longer-term drug release and potential longer-term or delayed toxicity, obtaining FDA approval, and conducting a clinical trial with cervical dysplasia patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this research project is to develop polymeric cervical implants ( cervical inserts ) that can providecontinuous release of compounds with therapeutic activity against cervical pre-cancer and cancer directly to the target site. When placed in the cervix these implants can deliver drugs continuously ( 24/7 ) for months, potentially obviate the need for electrosurgical excision of pre-cancerous lesions, and ultimately prevent the development of cervical cancer. This prophylactic treatment will benefit hundreds of thousands of women in the United States alone, who otherwise would require a surgical procedure. Worldwide, the benefits of this approach will be far greater, because cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women after breast cancer. In this pilot project, we will optimize cervical inserts and assess any potential toxicity associatedwith both the implant materials and with a naturally-occurring compound (withaferin A) with potent anticancer activity against cervical pre-cancer/cancer, using a large animal (goat) model.",-,wendyspencer@insightbb.com

Heart failure affects more than five million Americans and increases therisk of sudden death. This application sets out to develop a simple, inexpensive blood test to help predict sudden death risk that may prevent unnecessary ICD implants and help screen moderate risk populations now not treated. One advantage of this test isthat it reflects the state of cardiac Na+ channels (SCN5a). Modulation of these channels is already known to cause arrhythmias such as Brugada Syndrome when too little current is present and Long QT syndrome when too much current is present. Recently, wereported three SCN5a mRNA alternative splicing variants are upregulated in human HF tissue. These variants encoded nonfunctional cardiac Na+ channels. Our preliminary data show that white blood cells (WBCs) have abnormal Na+ channel mRNA splicing, that WBCsplicing is highly correlated with that in heart, and that HF patients have reduced full length Na+ channel and increased variants in their heart and blood when compared to control patients. Hypothesis. Since SCN5A is the main channel generating current for electrical propagation in heart muscle and mutations in this channel are known to cause arrhythmic sudden death, we hypothesize that these truncated mRNAs for the Na+ channel will contribute to arrhythmic risk in HF, and by quantifying their presence inblood, it will be possibl to develop a blood test that would help predict sudden death risk in HF patients. Product. This phase I application will establish the feasibility of a proprietary blood test to predict arrhythmi risk in HF patients. If successful, this test would be unique, since no other blood tests exist for this purpose. Specific aim 1: To determine if altered WBC Na+ channel mRNA variant abundances are associated with an elevated likelihood of sudden death risk as measured by appropriate discharge in patients with ICDs. Plans for Phase II. Phase II would be a prospective, multisite examination of the same relationship and product prototype development. Commercial Application. Initially, ROS' novel blood test will be sought by hospitals (5,000in the US) and physicians for use in over 500,000 patients who are diagnosed with HF annually in order to prevent unnecessary ICD implants. A reduction in the number of ICD implantations would save ~ 150 million annually in the US healthcare system.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ROS Technologies, Inc. is a medical diagnostics company developing a blood test to predict sudden death risk in patients with heart failure. Heart failure occurs in more than 550,000 US citizens each year, but there are no simple, reliable ways of predicting who is at highest risk for sudden cardiac death and who will benefit from an implanted defibrillator. This Phase I STTR application sets out to establish the feasibility of a blood test o predict sudden death risk and thereby help direct more than 1 billion/year in medical expenses to those most likely to benefit.",60606-1615,scdudley@uic.edu
